"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our conversation,  $7,500 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to reflect your budget and my desire to make this deal work. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",7000.0,Bob,4,
