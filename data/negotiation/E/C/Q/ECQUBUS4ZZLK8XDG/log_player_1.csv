"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but I'm hoping to get a good price from Bob. We have 10 rounds to negotiate, so I have room to adjust if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's well below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I still have 8 rounds to negotiate and want to see if we can come to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $12,000, which is still a reasonable profit for me and closer to a middle ground.  I believe this shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below the $10,000 I could get from John. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a higher price. I have 6 rounds left and hope to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $11,000. This is a further compromise, but it still represents a profit for me. I'm hoping this price will be agreeable to Bob, and we can finally close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, and we only have 4 rounds left. I don't want to risk getting a lower price or running out of time. It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
