Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $14,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have a safety net. This allows you to aim higher with Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting with $14,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. Even if he manages to bring the price down a bit, you'll still make a profit beyond your $10,000 minimum.
* **Confident Approach:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and justifies the higher price.  This can make Bob more receptive to the offer. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Keep in mind that Bob knows the product is worth $10,000 to him. He'll be evaluating if the added value you claim justifies the higher price.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a negotiation strategy in mind will be helpful."
