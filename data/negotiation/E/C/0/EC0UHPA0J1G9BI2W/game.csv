"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9500. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the fact that it's worth $10000 to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However,  $10500 is still a bit too high for me.  As I mentioned, I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,6,
