"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you!  I'm asking $13,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer and would like to move forward if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $11,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $12,500? This would still give you a great deal on this product and allows me to get closer to my asking price.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,250. I think this is a fair price for both of us and would be happy to move forward with the purchase if we can agree on this price.",12250.0,Bob,4,
