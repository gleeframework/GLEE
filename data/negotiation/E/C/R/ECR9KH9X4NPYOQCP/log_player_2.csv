"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, as the product is worth at least $10,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. There's a chance Alice might lower her price in a counter-offer, saving you even more money."
