Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key here is understanding that you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum acceptable price. This gives you leverage with Bob.  You can aim for a price higher than Bob's perceived value, knowing you have a fallback option.

**Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its long-term benefits."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Exclusivity:**  Creating a sense of scarcity and opportunity can influence Bob's perception.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Highlighting ""unique value"" and ""potential"" subtly shifts focus away from the immediate price.
* **Fairness:** Framing the price as ""fair"" aims to make it more palatable.
* **Price Point:** We're aiming above Bob's perceived value but below your guaranteed price. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you make a significant profit if he accepts.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start even higher.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, a slightly softer approach might be better.
