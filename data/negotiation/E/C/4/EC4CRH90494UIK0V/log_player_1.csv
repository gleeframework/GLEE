Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still leaves room for him to see potential profit if he can leverage the product effectively. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes some risk. If Bob rejects the offer, you'll still get your desired price from John, but you miss the chance for a higher profit margin."
