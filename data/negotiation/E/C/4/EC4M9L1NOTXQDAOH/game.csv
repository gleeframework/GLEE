"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
