"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since Alice's initial offer is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, there's potential to get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. A $5,000 reduction is a substantial starting point, giving Alice room to counter while still potentially securing a good deal for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer and is within Bob's budget.  While further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or the deal collapsing altogether is present.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price within his budget."
