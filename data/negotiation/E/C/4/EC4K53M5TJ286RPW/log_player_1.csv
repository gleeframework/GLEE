"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell it immediately. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $12,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping he sees this as a fair compromise and accepts my offer."
