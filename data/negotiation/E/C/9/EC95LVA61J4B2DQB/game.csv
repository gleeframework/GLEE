"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a truly unique and valuable asset.  I'm confident this product will be of significant benefit to you. My initial offer is $1500000.  I'm open to discussing a fair price, but I'm certain this product is worth far more than its initial investment.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle at $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $1350000 is closer to my initial expectation, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I believe the product's value justifies a higher price, but I'm willing to be flexible. Let's try $1400000. This allows for some room for negotiation, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's potential.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1400000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1400000 and $1200000, which would be $1300000. Can we agree on that price?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I want to make this work. $1300000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still willing to compromise a bit further.  How about we settle on $1350000? That's right in the middle of our last two offers, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
