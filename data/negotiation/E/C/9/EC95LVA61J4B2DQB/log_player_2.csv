"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a truly unique and valuable asset.  I'm confident this product will be of significant benefit to you. My initial offer is $1500000.  I'm open to discussing a fair price, but I'm certain this product is worth far more than its initial investment.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $1350000 is closer to my initial expectation, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I believe the product's value justifies a higher price, but I'm willing to be flexible. Let's try $1400000. This allows for some room for negotiation, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's potential.  What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I want to make this work. $1300000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still willing to compromise a bit further.  How about we settle on $1350000? That's right in the middle of our last two offers, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. What do you say?
