"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let you have it for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is less than your $100 maximum, you know you can get the product for $100 from John. Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer from her at a lower price, closer to her value of $80."
