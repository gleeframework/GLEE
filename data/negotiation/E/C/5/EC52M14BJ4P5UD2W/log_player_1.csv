"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. My starting price is $12,000, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I want to signal flexibility to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Highlighting Value:** By mentioning that Bob ""would really appreciate its value,"" I'm trying to subtly remind him of the product's potential worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe I can still get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob, especially since he's willing to discuss a compromise. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John is guaranteed, I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about we meet at $10,500?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Value Justification:**  I reiterate the product's value to remind Bob of its potential worth and justify the price.
* **Focus on Profit:** By mentioning a ""reasonable profit,"" I subtly imply that I won't go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, $9,800 is still below my minimum.
* **Limited Time:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I want to maximize my chances of getting a better deal. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, so there's a good chance I can secure a price closer to $10,500 in the next few rounds.

**Next Steps:**  I will counteroffer with a price slightly below $10,500, but above Bob's offer, to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to keep working with you.  How about we meet at $10,200?  This is a small step closer to your offer, and I believe it's still fair considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing flexibility without compromising too much. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to remind Bob why the price is justified.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  By proposing $10,200, I'm still above Bob's latest offer and closer to my desired price point.

**Next Steps:** I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept this offer, but if he rejects it, I'll have to decide if I want to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,200 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the pressure is mounting to secure a sale. 
* **Bob's Offer is Unsatisfactory:** $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and I doubt we can reach a compromise in the remaining rounds.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is much more appealing than the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

**Conclusion:**  While I would prefer to close the deal with Bob, the limited time and Bob's persistent low offers make selling to John the most sensible decision at this point."
