,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $122? It's closer to what I need, and still a fair price for you.",122.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try again? I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $118, which is a good compromise.  Let's make a deal and close this out.",118.0,Alice,5,
