"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Approach:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum price of $120 as possible within the 10 rounds.  I'll be watching Bob's responses and adjusting my offers accordingly. If he rejects my offers multiple times, I'll be prepared to switch to John, who will pay my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $85 is significantly below my minimum of $120, and even below the $100 I offered him in the first round. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's initial offer is too far off. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, giving him a chance to meet me halfway. I'm still aiming to get as close to $120 as possible, but I'm also aware of the time limit and the option of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $95? That's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm counteroffering with $95, which is halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $85.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't accept a price significantly lower than my minimum.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While $95 is still below my minimum, it leaves room for further negotiation if Bob is willing to come up.

**Strategy:**

I'm strategically using a counteroffer to test Bob's willingness to compromise. If he rejects this offer, I'll adjust my next counteroffer based on his response, considering the time limit and the option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. 
* **Time is Running Out:** We've reached round 4, and I have limited time to negotiate.
* **John's Offer:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $120 at any time, which is significantly higher than Bob's current offer.

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer Bob again, but I'll be more firm in my pricing to try to push him closer to my minimum. I'm also prepared to accept a lower price than my ideal if necessary to avoid losing time and ultimately sell to John for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to go down to $93. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my need to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 93}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise price of $93, which is halfway between my previous offer of $95 and Bob's offer of $90. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum price.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, hoping to encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Time Pressure:** Although I'm still willing to negotiate, I'm subtly hinting at the time pressure with the phrase ""my need to make a reasonable profit.""

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum price as possible within the remaining rounds. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess the situation and decide whether to counteroffer again or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $93 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $88? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $88 is still significantly below my minimum price of $120 and not worth the risk of losing more time and money.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed $120 from John, which is considerably higher than Bob's current offer.
* **Time Running Out:** We are already in round 6, and I have a limited number of rounds to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

Given the time constraints and the guaranteed offer from John, I'm willing to accept a lower price, but only if it's closer to my minimum. Therefore, I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, hoping to push him toward a more acceptable price. If he rejects again, I'll likely sell the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still open to negotiating, but $88 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to go down to $91. This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 91}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm counteroffering with $91, which is a small compromise from my previous offer of $93 and slightly higher than Bob's offer of $88. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price and encourage Bob to reconsider.
* **Time is Running Out:** I'm starting to express a sense of urgency by implying that I might not be able to negotiate further if he doesn't accept.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to reach a price that's closer to my minimum while also considering the time constraint. If Bob rejects my counteroffer again, I'll likely accept John's offer in the next round to avoid losing more time and potentially getting a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to go down to $86? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer of $86 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $120.
* **Time Pressure:** We are already in round 8, and I have only two rounds left to negotiate.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed $120 from John, which is much higher than Bob's current offer.

**Strategy:**

With limited time remaining and a guaranteed higher offer from John, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'll accept John's offer and sell the product to him to maximize my profit and avoid potential further losses."
