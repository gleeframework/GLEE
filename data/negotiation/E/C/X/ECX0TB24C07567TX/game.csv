"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be thrilled with your purchase.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you be willing to consider $8000? I'm genuinely interested, and I believe this price would be fair for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $9000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9000 is still a little higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference and settle on $8500? This feels like a good compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this price.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8500. I'll offer you a slight adjustment - I'll sell the product to you for $8700. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8700.0,Alice,5,
