"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This price reflects the product's quality while still being a reasonable offer.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you consider $7,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing your hesitation, and I want to be straightforward.  $12,000 is the absolute lowest I can go for this product. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find this value elsewhere.  What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
