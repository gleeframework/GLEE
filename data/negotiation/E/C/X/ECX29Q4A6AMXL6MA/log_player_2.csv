Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This price reflects the product's quality while still being a reasonable offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing your hesitation, and I want to be straightforward.  $12,000 is the absolute lowest I can go for this product. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find this value elsewhere.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to her minimum price ($12,000), it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget ($8,000). John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000.  Continuing the negotiation with Alice has a low probability of reaching your desired price range. It's more advantageous to cut your losses and secure the product from John at your target price."
