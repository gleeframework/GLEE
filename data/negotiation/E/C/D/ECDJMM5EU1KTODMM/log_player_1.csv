"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations, and I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 22000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000) provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Leaving Room for Adjustment:** The high starting price allows me to make concessions in later rounds without going below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in the product's value might influence Bob's perception.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Clearly stating my willingness to discuss further encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product. Is this something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price. I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $22,000 might have been a bit high, I believe this product offers significant value beyond $15,000.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $18,500?"", ""product_price"": 18500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:**  Showing respect for Bob's counter-offer helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Highlighting Value:** Reemphasizing the product's value helps justify a price higher than Bob's initial offer. 
* **Compromise:** Suggesting a price exactly in the middle of our previous offers demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit shy of $18,500. Would you be willing to consider $17,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $17,000 is a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating a strong desire to purchase the product. 
* **Time Value:** Accepting now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations and secures a good deal quickly.

While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the sale altogether increases the longer the negotiation continues. Accepting $17,000 ensures a favorable outcome."
