"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000.  Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's target price, he can still potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially lower the price further. There are still 7 rounds remaining, giving Bob ample time to try and reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his previous offer of $8,500 and Alice's current offer of $9,000. Offering $8,750 shows a willingness to compromise while still attempting to save money. This also keeps the negotiation moving forward and avoids resorting to John's offer yet."
