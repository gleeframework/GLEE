"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is offering the product for more than your maximum budget of $10,000. You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John, so it makes the most sense to go with that option and save the extra $2,000."
