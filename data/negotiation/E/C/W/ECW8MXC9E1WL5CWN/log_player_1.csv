Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $1,500,000 allows room for negotiation while still potentially securing a significant profit.
* **Scarcity tactic:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially motivating Bob to accept the offer quickly. 
* **Direct and confident:** The language is straightforward and positions the product as valuable, justifying the high price.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiation style and risk tolerance, you might adjust your approach."
