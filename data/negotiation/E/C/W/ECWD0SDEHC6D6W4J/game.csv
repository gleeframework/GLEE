"I understand you're working with a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'll offer you the product for $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
