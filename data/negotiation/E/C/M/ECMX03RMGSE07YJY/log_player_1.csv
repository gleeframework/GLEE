Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will benefit you greatly. I'm offering it to you at $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, the goal is to maximize profit. Offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price might result in a quicker sale and still yields a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Setting the price at $1,100,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets the product for $300,000 less than its worth to him, and you earn a profit of $300,000 (compared to selling it to John). 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning exclusivity and a limited-time offer, we aim to incentivize Bob to make a decision quickly. 

This approach balances risk and reward, aiming for the best possible outcome."
