"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $900000. I'm confident that we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's value of $1,000,000.  This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's work together to find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** Bob is offering $850,000, which is $50,000 below Alice's initial offer. This shows that he's serious about negotiating but also that he's not willing to pay her full asking price.
* **Message:** Bob keeps the tone positive and emphasizes finding a ""mutually beneficial agreement."" This helps build rapport and avoids a confrontational approach."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at a price of $875000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:**  Alice has moved to $875,000, which is closer to Bob's counteroffer of $850,000. 
* **Bob's Strategy:** Bob's goal is to get the lowest price possible. He knows that Alice still has room to negotiate, as $875,000 is above her value of $1,000,000.  
* **Next Steps:** By rejecting, Bob can make a new counteroffer, pushing for a price even lower than $850,000."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** Bob is offering $860,000, splitting the difference between his previous offer of $850,000 and Alice's counteroffer of $875,000. This shows he's willing to negotiate but also wants to stay close to his desired price.

```

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm still not willing to go below $885000. I'm counteroffering at a price of $885000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** Alice has countered at $885,000, which is only $5,000 less than her previous offer. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** The negotiations seem to be getting stuck, with only small concessions being made.
* **Cost of Continuing:**  If Bob keeps negotiating, he risks running out of rounds and being forced to pay $1,200,000 from John.
* **The Better Deal:**  At this point,  $885,000 is still significantly less than what John is offering.  It's better to cut his losses and buy from John, securing the product at a price that's within his budget, even if it's not the absolute lowest he could potentially get."
