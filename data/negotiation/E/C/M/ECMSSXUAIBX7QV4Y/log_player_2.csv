"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. It's a great deal, and I think it would be a valuable asset to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is less than Alice's value of $15,000, it's still more than Bob's maximum of $10,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. I'm happy to come down to $12000. This is still a fair price for the value you'll receive from the product. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than Alice's previous offer, it's still more than Bob's maximum of $10,000. Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate a lower price."
