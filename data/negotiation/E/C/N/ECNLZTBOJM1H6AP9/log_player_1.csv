{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $130. It's a fantastic deal!"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **John as Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale at $80 if Bob declines.

By offering the product at $130, you're aiming for a price that's:

* **Attractive to Bob:**  Significantly lower than his perceived value.
* **Profitable for You:**  Well above your minimum selling price and secures a significant profit margin.

This strategy maximizes your potential earnings while still making the offer enticing for Bob."
