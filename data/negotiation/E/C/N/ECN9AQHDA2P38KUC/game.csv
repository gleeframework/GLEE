"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market, however, the value of this product is truly exceptional and goes beyond standard market considerations.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you believe the product has exceptional value, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the market conditions and the product's value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
