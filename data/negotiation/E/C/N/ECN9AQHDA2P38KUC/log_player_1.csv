Round 2

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, the pace of negotiation and the gap between his offers and my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) suggest it's unlikely we'll reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds. It's strategically more beneficial to cut my losses now and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John rather than risk Bob not reaching an acceptable offer within the 10-round limit."
