"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product at a price of $9,500. I think it will be very valuable to you, and this is a very competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There is a good chance to negotiate a much better price, closer to Alice's value of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range.  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, hoping she'll be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $7,000 is significantly below its value.  I could consider $9,000, which is a generous offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but still leaving plenty of room for negotiation. We're getting closer to a price I might accept, but it's worth pushing a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

This counter-offer directly targets Alice's estimated value of the product.  It's a strong offer, and by framing it as a ""fair deal"" and ""meeting in the middle,""  I'm hoping to persuade Alice to accept."
