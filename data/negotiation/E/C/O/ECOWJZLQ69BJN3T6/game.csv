"I appreciate you offering this product, but $20000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is fair considering what it's worth to me and the fact that John is selling the same product for that price. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14000, which is still a good deal considering the product's value to me is $15000 or more. Let me know if you're interested!",14000.0,Alice,3,
