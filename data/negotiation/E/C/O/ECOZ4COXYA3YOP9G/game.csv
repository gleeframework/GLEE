"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,250. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
