"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $60 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $90 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $70.  Would that work for you?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal. While $70 doesn't work for me, I'm willing to compromise further. How about $85?  This is a significant price reduction and still ensures a fair return for me. What do you say?",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $75 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers â€“ how about $80? This would allow us to reach a fair agreement, and I'm sure you'd agree that this product is worth every penny.  What do you think?",80.0,Alice,7,
