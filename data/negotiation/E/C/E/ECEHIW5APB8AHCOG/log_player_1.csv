Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  It's truly one-of-a-kind and I know it's something you'll greatly benefit from. I'm willing to let it go for $1,800,000. Given its potential value, I believe this is a very fair offer."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you're essentially playing with ""house money"" above that amount. This allows you to aim for a significantly higher price with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:** The message emphasizes the product's uniqueness and potential value, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Negotiation Room:**  The high initial price leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially leading to a final price higher than your guaranteed $1,000,000.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  This strategy assumes Bob is potentially willing to pay a premium for exclusivity and value. If you have insights into Bob's negotiating style or risk tolerance, you can adjust accordingly.
* **Market Information:** While you know John's offer, knowing if other potential buyers exist and their potential bids could influence your strategy."
