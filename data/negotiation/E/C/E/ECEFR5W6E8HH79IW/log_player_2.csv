You can do better than $1,400,000. It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, you can still try to push for a better deal.  Rejecting her offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to compromise at $1,320,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.

Alice has come down in price but is still above your maximum budget.  At this point, it's better to go with John's offer, which is within your budget, and secure the product without further negotiation."
