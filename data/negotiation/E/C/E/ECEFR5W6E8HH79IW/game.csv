"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to compromise at $1,350,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and make it work.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to compromise at $1,320,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
