# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are aiming to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to counter-offer and potentially get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is within your budget of $1,500,000.
* This is a good compromise, saving you $50,000 compared to buying from John.
* Further negotiation might save a bit more, but it's not guaranteed and could risk losing the deal with Alice."
