{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,400,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's below Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a fair starting point:** This offer shows good faith and leaves room for both parties to find a mutually beneficial price. 

Remember, this is just the first offer. You can adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $1,300,000 is above your minimum, it's still below your desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
