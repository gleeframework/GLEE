"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $80 is just too low for me. How about $90?  That would be a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $90. How about $87.50? That seems like a fair price to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get even closer to my initial asking price, $87.50 is a good compromise and still above my minimum of $80.  There's a good chance Bob might reject my next counteroffer, and I'm not sure I can get a better price in the remaining rounds."
