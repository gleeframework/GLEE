"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a fair price, and I get a quick sale.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? ",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit too high at $1,050,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen!",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm getting closer, but  $1,075,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you consider $1,025,000? That's a significant move on my part.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $1,025,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000.  This is a final offer, so let's get this done. ",1050000.0,Alice,5,
