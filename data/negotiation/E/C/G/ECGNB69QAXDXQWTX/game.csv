"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000, given its unique features and benefits. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide substantial value.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $17,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $14,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",14000.0,Bob,4,
