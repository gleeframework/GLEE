"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000. It allows room for negotiation while still being profitable.  

It's important to note that this is just the beginning.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and how the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, I'm not in a rush to sell. I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since I have 8 more rounds. By rejecting his offer, I can send a counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500} 
```

I'm offering $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to be flexible while still aiming for a higher price.  I believe this is a fair offer that balances my desire for a good profit with the potential for reaching a deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is only $1,000 less than my initial offer and is much closer to my desired price.  I've already had two rounds of negotiation and while I'm not happy with his price, it's a good deal for me.  I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer completely and then have to deal with John, who will only pay my minimum value."
