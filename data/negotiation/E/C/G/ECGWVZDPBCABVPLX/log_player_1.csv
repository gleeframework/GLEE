Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while your offer is getting closer, $1,700,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value we've both discussed.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price without significant further negotiation. Selling to John guarantees I receive my desired amount without further risk or delay."
