I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.,15000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $12000 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, at $9750. This price is a good compromise that benefits both of us. Let me know if this is something you can work with.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9750. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll meet you at $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $11000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference and meet at $10000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, so I'll make one more serious offer. I'll sell the product to you for $11500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a good deal for you.",11500.0,Alice,7,
