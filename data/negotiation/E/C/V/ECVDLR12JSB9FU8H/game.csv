"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still a bit above your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we compromise at $11500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,
