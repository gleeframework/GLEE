"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation. I'm also aware that John is a safety net, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is a decent amount, I'm aiming for a significantly higher price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low offer just yet.  I'll counteroffer and see where we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a substantial profit. I'm trying to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This should demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a respectable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, I believe I can still do better. There are more rounds left, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that's so significantly below my initial target.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm making a further concession by lowering the price to $1,100,000. I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still confident that I can secure a better price than what John is offering.  I'm hoping Bob will see my willingness to negotiate and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept, I still believe I can get a better deal. We're already halfway through the negotiation process, and I'm not ready to settle for less than I think the product is worth. I'm confident I can get Bob to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

This is my final counteroffer before I consider selling to John.  I'm now only $50,000 away from Bob's last offer.  I believe this demonstrates my commitment to closing a deal while still preserving a reasonable profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are now at the end game of the negotiation.  Bob is now only offering $25,000 more than John is offering. Since I am running out of rounds, I will accept John's offer. I am confident that I can find another buyer later who will be willing to pay a higher price for my product."
