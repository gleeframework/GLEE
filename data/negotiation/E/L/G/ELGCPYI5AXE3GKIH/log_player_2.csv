"Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $15,000 to her, so she has some room to negotiate. I will wait for a better offer or buy from John for $8,000.
