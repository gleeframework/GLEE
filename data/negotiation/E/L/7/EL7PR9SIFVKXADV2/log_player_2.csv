"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate.  Since the product is worth $100 to me, there's potential to get a lower price from Alice. I'll start by rejecting the offer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount of $20 from Alice's initial offer. This signals my willingness to negotiate, but also shows I'm serious about purchasing the product if the price is right.  I'm aiming to get as close to my $100 limit as possible without risking the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price. However, I'm still willing to negotiate a bit more.  Rejecting allows me to continue the conversation and hopefully get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but I still want to see if I can get it down to $90. This is a reasonable compromise between our previous offers and keeps the negotiation moving forward.  If she rejects, I'll have to consider whether to accept her next offer or buy from John."
