"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""immense value and potential,"" I aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a higher level. 
* **Negotiation Mindset:** This initial offer sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation, which is crucial given the 10-round limit. It signals that I am open to finding a mutually agreeable price. 

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright with the potential reward of securing a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $1,500,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly higher than his initial ""budget"" statement. This suggests there's room for negotiation. 

Rejecting his offer and providing a counteroffer keeps the negotiation alive. I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,600,000 - $1,700,000 before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  After carefully considering the product's value, I'm proposing a price of $1,700,000. I believe this offer represents a significant step towards a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I lowered my price by $100,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. 
* **Holding Ground:**  The new price of $1,700,000 is still significantly above Bob's offer and closer to my target range. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I continue to reinforce the product's value, hoping to nudge Bob's perception closer to my asking price.

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation momentum while pushing for a higher selling price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000. I hope this helps us move closer to a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a significant profit above my minimum selling price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product. Accepting now secures a favorable outcome.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations might yield a slightly higher price, but there's also the risk that Bob could walk away or the deal could stall. Accepting now eliminates this risk.

While selling to John is guaranteed $1,200,000, Bob's offer presents a $400,000 increase.  It's time to secure this win."
