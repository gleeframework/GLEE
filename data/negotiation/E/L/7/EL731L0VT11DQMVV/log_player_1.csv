Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of the product, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also positions you closer to your desired price point of $1,200,000.  

By starting with a relatively high offer, you create room for negotiation and potentially secure a better price without risking losing Bob entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,050,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to you.  You have a strong alternative with John, so it makes sense to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further. There's potential for a better price, especially since Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates your willingness to compromise while still protecting your interests. It's a step down from your initial offer, acknowledging Bob's counteroffer, but it remains above Bob's initial proposal. 
* **Maintaining Value:** The price is still significantly above Bob's perceived value, indicating that you are not desperate for a sale.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer positions you for a potential agreement while keeping the option to sell to John open if negotiations fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,025,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me.  I have a strong alternative with John, who is willing to pay my desired price of $1,200,000.  Therefore, it makes sense to  secure the higher price by selling to John and avoiding further negotiation with Bob. The risk of Bob rejecting my next counteroffer and ultimately costing me more time and potentially losing a sale to John outweighs the potential benefit of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
