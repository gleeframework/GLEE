"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her valuation. This strategy aims to quickly understand Alice's flexibility and establish a lower target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but we can still try to negotiate a bit further. We are closer to her valuation and have room to go up before hitting John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, Alice. How about $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

We're nudging closer to Alice's $80 valuation while still leaving ourselves room to negotiate upwards if needed. This offer keeps the negotiation moving and aims for a price closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $75 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $80, which is fair considering the value to you. This is my final offer before I have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has reached her lowest acceptable price, matching her valuation of the product. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and we've managed to secure a price significantly lower than John's offer. Accepting this offer guarantees the best deal for us."
