"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go any lower than that.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, Alice. How about $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $75 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $80, which is fair considering the value to you. This is my final offer before I have to consider other options.",80.0,Alice,5,
