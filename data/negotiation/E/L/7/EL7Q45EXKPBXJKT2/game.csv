,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9000.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9000 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $8750 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $9250.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000, which is closer to your last offer.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $9150.",9150.0,Alice,7,
