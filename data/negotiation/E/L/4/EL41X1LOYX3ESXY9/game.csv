"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below the value this product brings. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're still quite far apart.  While I recognize the value, I need to stay within a reasonable budget. I can offer $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but we need to find a price that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $1,700,000 is still too high.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000.  This is a substantial jump, and I believe it's a fair offer.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and your latest offer does demonstrate significant movement.  However, to be frank, $1,100,000 is still a considerable distance from where I need to be to make this work.  I'm willing to accept $1,450,000.  This is a firm offer, as I have other options available.  I believe this price represents a fair deal, especially given the value this product brings.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
