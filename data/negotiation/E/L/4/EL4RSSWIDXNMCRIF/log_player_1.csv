{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'm also emphasizing the value proposition to Bob to make the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,250. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is just above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a good deal considering Bob's willingness to negotiate and the risk of losing the deal."
