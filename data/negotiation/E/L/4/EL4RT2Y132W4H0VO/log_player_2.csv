"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  Bob's maximum budget is $1,500,000, and Alice is asking for $1,400,000. This leaves very little room for negotiation.
* **There's potential for a better deal.**  Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price. There's a good chance Alice will lower her price to close the deal, as she values the product at $1,200,000.
* **John's offer is a safety net.**  Bob knows he can always buy from John for $1,500,000, so he has room to negotiate aggressively with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** Bob's counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges Alice's starting point, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Appeal to value:**  Bob highlights the product's value and his budget constraint, which can resonate with Alice's desire to close the deal.
* **Openness to negotiation:** Bob's message ends on a positive note, indicating he is open to further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the value of this product is closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, meeting him halfway. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable price:** While not Bob's ideal price, $1,350,000 is still within his budget and a good deal compared to John's $1,500,000 offer.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Even though Bob accepts, he can still try to negotiate for lower shipping costs or additional services during the closing process.

**Overall, it's a good deal for Bob, and there's little incentive to risk further negotiation.**"
