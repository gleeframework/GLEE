Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $110, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $110, which is slightly higher than John's offer of $100. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially earn more. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging Bob to consider the offer. I'm also signaling that I'm open to negotiation, which might make him more willing to engage.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a price that maximizes my profit while keeping Bob engaged. By starting slightly above John's offer, I create a little pressure on Bob to make a counteroffer. This gives me an opportunity to negotiate and potentially get a higher price than John's offer.  If Bob rejects my offer, I can assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or simply sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $80. Would you be willing to negotiate down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell and believe I can get a better deal.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to push the price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a great product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a counteroffer of $105, which is halfway between my initial offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $95. This shows a willingness to compromise while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message positive and focused on the value of the product. I'm also reiterating my willingness to negotiate to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

By taking a middle ground, I'm hoping to convince Bob that $105 is a fair price that benefits both of us.  If he rejects this offer, I'll re-evaluate the situation and decide whether to sell to John or continue negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I would like to propose an offer of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. It's also the same as what John is offering.  Since I'm not guaranteed a higher price by continuing to negotiate, it makes sense to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
