"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $75. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",75.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While $75 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $70. Would that work for you?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $70, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer you the product for $72.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the value.",72.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and call it $71?",71.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I like the idea of splitting the difference, Bob, but I'm not quite comfortable with $71. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer you the product for $72. It's a small step closer to your target, and I think it's still a fair price.",72.0,Alice,7,
