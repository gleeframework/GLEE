"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $900,000 is a good starting point, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise and a great opportunity for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $950,000. Can you meet me at that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is the minimum I can accept. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $975,000 still doesn't reflect the value of the product. I'm willing to go down to $990,000. This is a small compromise on my end. If you're truly interested, I believe this is our final offer.  What do you say?",990000.0,Alice,7,
