"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high with a price of $1,000,000. This is a bold opening that sets a strong baseline for the negotiation. It also gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters. While I'm willing to accept a minimum of $800,000 from John, I want to see if I can get more from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I think I can still get more. I'll see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintains a price that's closer to my initial asking price. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair offer and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. I'm getting closer to my desired price, and we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds.  There's no guarantee I can get more in the following rounds, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
