"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Confident Tone:**  By expressing confidence in the product's value, I aim to influence Bob's perception and potentially secure a higher final price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""initially offering"" and ""mutually beneficial arrangement"" signals my willingness to negotiate. 

The goal is to maximize profit while remaining realistic about the 10-round limit and the guaranteed offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. It's early in the negotiation, and I have leverage with John's offer.  I'll counter in the next round to guide the negotiation towards a more reasonable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $500,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. Let's find a more realistic middle ground. I'm proposing $1,900,000. This acknowledges your initial offer while reflecting the true value of what we're discussing."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** I start by recognizing Bob's offer to show I'm listening and open to negotiation.
* **Firm but Fair:** While I significantly decrease my asking price,  I still emphasize the product's value and aim for a price well above both my minimum and Bob's initial offer.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  The message explicitly aims for a compromise, signaling a willingness to negotiate further while setting a firm boundary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find a price that works for both of us.  $1,900,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. I can go up to $650,000, but that's my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob increased his offer, but it's still far below my minimum and a smaller increment than my previous concession. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only 6 rounds left,  I need to accelerate progress or consider John's offer seriously.
* **Leverage:** I still have the guaranteed offer from John.

I'll make another counteroffer, but I'll signal more strongly that I'm willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground, but your current offer is still a significant gap from where we need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, but this is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I need to consider other options for selling this product."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** I'm significantly reducing my asking price, but making it clear this is my final offer to create urgency. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I explicitly mention ""other options,"" implicitly referring to John's offer to signal I'm willing to walk away. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 5 rounds left, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to make a serious offer or risk losing the deal.

This strategy balances making a profit with the risk of Bob walking away. By setting a firm boundary, I'm forcing a decision point in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a long way from what I can agree to. I can offer $800,000. This is my final offer as well. I do believe this is a fair price and would be a shame to walk away from this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has reached his final offer, which is his perceived value of the product. It's unlikely he'll go any higher.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of ending up with a lower offer or no deal at all.  
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer guarantees my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and avoids further negotiation.

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's not worth jeopardizing a guaranteed $1,500,000, especially with limited rounds remaining."
