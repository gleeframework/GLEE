"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $500,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. Let's find a more realistic middle ground. I'm proposing $1,900,000. This acknowledges your initial offer while reflecting the true value of what we're discussing.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we need to find a price that works for both of us.  $1,900,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. I can go up to $650,000, but that's my limit.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground, but your current offer is still a significant gap from where we need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, but this is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I need to consider other options for selling this product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a long way from what I can agree to. I can offer $800,000. This is my final offer as well. I do believe this is a fair price and would be a shame to walk away from this deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
