"I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. After considering your offer, I am unable to accept it at $8,500. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we meet halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer? That would be $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $8,750? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this price.",8750.0,Bob,4,
