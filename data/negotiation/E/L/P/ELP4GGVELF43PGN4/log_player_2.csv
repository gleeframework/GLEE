"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good deal, there's still potential to negotiate further and get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter and see if Alice is willing to drop the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. After considering your offer, I am unable to accept it at $8,500. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we meet halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer? That would be $9,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest possible price. While $9,000 is closer to his target than Alice's initial offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to counter again and potentially secure an even better price."
