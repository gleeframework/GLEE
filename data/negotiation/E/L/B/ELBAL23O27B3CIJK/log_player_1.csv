"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. This price gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me with a substantial gain.  I'm confident I can get a better deal than John's offer, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that yet.  I believe I can get more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm dropping the price a bit, showing flexibility while still aiming for a significant profit. $1,250,000 is a good compromise, and I'm hopeful Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer, and while it's not my ideal price, I'm not sure I can push Bob much further. It's better to secure a deal now than risk losing him completely."
