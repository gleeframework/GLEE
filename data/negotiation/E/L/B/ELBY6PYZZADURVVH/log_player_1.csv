Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves some room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm countering with $105. This is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It's still above my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer rather than risking losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I don't want to risk another round of negotiation. I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. It's a guaranteed sale and meets my minimum price, which is what's most important to me."
