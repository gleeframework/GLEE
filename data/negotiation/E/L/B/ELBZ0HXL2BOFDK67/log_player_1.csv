Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1 million. This is a strong opening that reflects the product's value to me while leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to explore those possibilities."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm countering with $900,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I still believe the product is worth more than his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise. While it's not my ideal price, it's closer to my desired value than John's offer. I'm willing to accept this deal to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
