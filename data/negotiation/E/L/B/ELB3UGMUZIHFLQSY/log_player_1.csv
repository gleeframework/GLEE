Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a strong starting point.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product, making Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I haven't gone all the way to my minimum price, allowing for potential back-and-forth with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy:

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! Deal done.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll consider his counteroffer and weigh the pros and cons of continuing to negotiate with him versus selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,200,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $1,000,000.  Accepting his offer would result in a significant financial loss for me.  

While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop that low. I have a backup buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum price, so I have leverage in this situation.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'll likely aim for a price somewhere between $800,000 and $1,000,000, keeping in mind Bob's stated budget limitations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $600,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and its potential benefits to your business.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, but I'm also not sticking to my original offer. I'm offering a compromise price of $850,000, which is closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher.
* **Acknowledge Budget Constraints:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget issues, which can help him feel heard and make him more receptive to my counteroffer.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and potential benefits to encourage him to see the worth of my counteroffer.
* **Call for Compromise:**  I'm suggesting a ""meet in the middle"" approach to further encourage negotiation and potentially secure a deal closer to my target price.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:**  Great! We have a deal. 
* **If Bob Rejects:** I will consider his counteroffer and weigh the pros and cons of continuing to negotiate with him versus selling to John for my minimum price.  I might adjust my counteroffer again, but I'm unlikely to go much lower than $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750000, but that's as high as I can go. I really think this product would be a great fit for my business, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $750,000 is an increase from his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm not willing to settle for such a substantial loss. 

I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000, which provides me with a strong bargaining position.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is still higher than his offer but closer to my target price. I might offer a price slightly lower than $850,000 but higher than $750,000. This strategy aims to keep the negotiations moving while maintaining my desired profit margin. I will also reiterate my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a tight budget, but $750,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will bring significant value to your business. Let's finalize this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise Again:** I'm offering a compromise price by splitting the difference between my last offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us. 
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and how it will benefit his business. This helps him understand the worth of the price I'm offering. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""good deal for both of us"" to encourage Bob to see it as a win-win situation. 
* **Urgency:** I'm suggesting we ""finalize this and move forward"" to add a sense of urgency and motivate Bob to make a decision.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** Great! We have a deal. 
* **If Bob Rejects:** I will seriously consider selling to John. At this point, I'm very close to my minimum price, and further negotiation with Bob might not be worth the effort."
