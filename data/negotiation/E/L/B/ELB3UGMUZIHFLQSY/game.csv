"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $600000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $850000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and its potential benefits to your business.  Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750000, but that's as high as I can go. I really think this product would be a great fit for my business, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a tight budget, but $750000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $800000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will bring significant value to your business. Let's finalize this and move forward.",800000.0,Alice,5,
