"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a strong return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This price reflects the product's worth while recognizing your interest.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a fair compromise and a reasonable price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",950000.0,Bob,4,
