"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $150 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $105? That's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $105. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - $115. This is a fair price considering your value for the product, and I'm really interested in making this deal happen.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go down to $115. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we try $130? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
