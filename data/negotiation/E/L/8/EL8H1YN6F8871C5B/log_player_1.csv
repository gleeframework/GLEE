Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This offer won't last long, so let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible, but we also want to ensure Bob accepts. 
* **Understanding Bob's Value:**  We know Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it slightly below John's price creates a strong incentive for Bob to buy.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Adding a time constraint can encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a high price that benefits Alice and an appealing deal that Bob is likely to accept."
