Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. Given its features and value, I'm offering it at $22,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider it. How about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $22,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  This is my best offer and a fair price for such a high-quality product."", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, I'm still finding it hard to justify going above $13,000 for this product. Would you be willing to come down a bit more? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Bob is not likely to move much higher than $13,000.  It's time to cut bait and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
