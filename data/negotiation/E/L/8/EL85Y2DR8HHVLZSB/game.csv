"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value this product holds for me,  $1,300,000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. Let's see if we can make this work.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I still think $1,250,000 is a bit low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,375,000. This is the best I can do, but I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,375,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is closer to my initial offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go back down to $1,300,000 after I already met you halfway at $1,375,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is my final offer, but I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
