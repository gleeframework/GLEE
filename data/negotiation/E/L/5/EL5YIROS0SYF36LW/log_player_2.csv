"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's lower than John's price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Rejecting the offer makes sense:**  You can still buy the product from John, even if it's at the higher price.  This strategy allows you to stay within your budget."
