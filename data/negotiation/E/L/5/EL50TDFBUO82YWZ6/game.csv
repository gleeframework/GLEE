"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm trying to be flexible. However, $10,200 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to meet you halfway, at $10,600. This offer is a true compromise, and I believe it reflects the value you'll gain from this product.  Let's try to close this deal, what do you say?",10600.0,Alice,5,
