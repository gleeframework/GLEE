"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1400000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but I'm going to need to come in lower than that. I'm willing to pay $1250000. This is my best offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, and I'm glad to hear that you think $1250000 is a fair price. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'm counteroffering at $1300000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  I'm willing to go up to $1275000. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still think we can do better than $1275000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1275000 and $1300000, which is $1287500. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",1287500.0,Alice,5,
