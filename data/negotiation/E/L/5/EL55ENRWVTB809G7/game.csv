"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but that price point is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I think that's closer, I'm still aiming for something closer to my initial counter.  Would you be willing to consider $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to meet in the middle at $987,500.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I think it reflects the value of the product well.  Let me know what you think.",987500.0,Bob,6,
