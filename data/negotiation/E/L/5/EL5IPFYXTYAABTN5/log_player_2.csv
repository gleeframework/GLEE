"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's valued at $8,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to get the product at a lower price than you'd normally pay, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
