Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $14,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $13,500.  What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really keen on your product, but $13,750 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $13,625? It's a fair compromise and allows both of us to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,625

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. $13,625 is a good price, and it's worth risking a potential counteroffer from Bob to secure the deal."
