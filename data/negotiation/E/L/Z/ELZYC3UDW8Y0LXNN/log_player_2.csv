"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price is fair considering its potential worth to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal.  While $1,000,000 is less than Bob's maximum, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. Bob is trying to get a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but he's still offering a price that's above Alice's minimum acceptable value.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate, but encourages her to consider a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000. This reflects the product's value and my desire to reach an agreement. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than her initial offer, and it's within Bob's budget. Accepting this offer saves Bob $50,000 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob needing to buy from John makes accepting the current offer the best strategy."
