"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me in the middle at $13500?",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $14000 is the lowest I can go. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested!",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $14000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13500. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $13500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be at least $13750. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested.",13750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13750 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",13500.0,Bob,6,
