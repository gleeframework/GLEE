"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:**  This is a starting point that's higher than my minimum value but allows for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and enthusiastic to encourage Bob to engage. I'm also highlighting the value proposition of the product. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a high initial offer to see if Bob is truly interested.  If he rejects, I can gauge his interest level and adjust my strategy for future rounds. I also have the safety net of John's offer, so I'm not under pressure to close the deal immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me in the middle at $13500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's Offer:** While $13,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's counteroffer, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate to sell and I'm willing to negotiate further. This puts the pressure back on Bob and potentially encourages him to increase his offer. I also want to see if he's truly interested or just trying to lowball me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $14,000 is the lowest I can go. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000:**  I'm only slightly decreasing my price, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product highly.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating the value of the product while offering a compromise. I'm also encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Strategy:**

I want to keep the pressure on Bob by showing that I'm not willing to drop the price significantly. This might encourage him to accept the offer or get closer to my desired price in the next round. If he rejects, I can then consider lowering my offer further or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $14000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's Offer:** While $13,500 is tempting, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price range. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer again, I'm demonstrating my commitment to getting a better price. This might encourage Bob to increase his offer, or at least show that he's genuinely interested in the product.  I'm also still keeping my options open â€“ if Bob continues to stall, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $13,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be at least $13,750. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,750:** This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing I'm willing to budge, but it's still a decent amount above Bob's last offer.
* **Message:** I'm highlighting that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to make a decision. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to push Bob to make a decision.  If he accepts, I'll close the deal at a respectable price. If he rejects, I'll be forced to make a decision: sell to John for $10,000 or continue to negotiate with Bob and risk further price concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13750 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accept Bob's Offer:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's clear that Bob won't go any higher.  Accepting his offer ensures I get $13,500, which is still a good profit and above my minimum.  

**Strategy:**

I've reached a point where continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely.  By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale and avoid the uncertainty of selling to John for a lower price.  The goal is to maximize profit, and in this case, accepting is the best option."
