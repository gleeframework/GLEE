Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,500 is more than your minimum of $12,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario.
* **It shows you're serious:** A firm offer demonstrates you're willing to negotiate but also have a clear idea of the product's worth. 

Remember, the goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible.  Keep in mind John's $12,000 offer as your safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,500 is more than John's offer, it's still below your desired price. There's still room for negotiation to get closer to your goal of $15,000.  It's worth trying to push Bob a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,000?  That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $13,750? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not overspending. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,750 is tempting, it's still below your desired range.  You're close to your goal, and there's still potential for Bob to meet you halfway.  One more counteroffer might be enough to secure a deal closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  $13,750 is a fair offer, but I'm hoping to get closer to $14,000.  Let's compromise at $13,875.  That's only $125 more than your last offer, and it gives us both a good outcome.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,875. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,500? I'm really close to walking away, but I still think this product would be a great fit for me. Can you make that happen? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While you'd prefer a higher price, Bob has made it clear he's unlikely to budge further. Accepting his offer of $13,500 is the best option here. You'll still make a profit, and rejecting him risks losing the deal entirely. You can't afford to walk away at this point, given John's offer."
