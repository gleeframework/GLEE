"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me at that price?",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,000?  That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's make this happen!",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $13,750? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not overspending.",13750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $13,750 is a fair offer, but I'm hoping to get closer to $14,000.  Let's compromise at $13,875.  That's only $125 more than your last offer, and it gives us both a good outcome.  What do you say?",13875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,875. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,500? I'm really close to walking away, but I still think this product would be a great fit for me. Can you make that happen?",13500.0,Bob,6,
