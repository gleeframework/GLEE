"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** My message highlights the value of the product, suggesting that the price is fair.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message doesn't close the door on negotiation, encouraging Bob to respond. 

This strategy aims to establish a strong starting point while leaving space for a productive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the product is worth less than that. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** While $1,000,000 is a substantial amount, it's still significantly below my desired range. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I believe there's room for a better deal, and I'm confident that I can secure a higher price by continuing the negotiation with Bob.
* **Avoiding Premature Sale:** Selling to John at this point would be a loss for me.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,100,000 is the lowest I can go. This still gives you a substantial saving compared to the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to compromise. 
* **Reasonable Reduction:**  The new offer is a significant reduction from my initial proposal, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Value Justification:**  I remind Bob of the product's worth and the potential saving he can still realize. 

By taking a smaller step down and emphasizing the value, I aim to entice Bob into accepting this counteroffer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Staying Firm:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my target. I'm not willing to accept a deal that doesn't come closer to my desired price.
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  With 6 rounds remaining, I'm confident I can push for a more favorable price.
* **Avoiding Loss:** Selling to John at this point would be a considerable loss compared to what I believe I can achieve with Bob. 

I'm betting on my negotiating skills and the value of the product to achieve a better outcome."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,075,000 for the product. This is a fair price, given its value and our continued discussions. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's compromise and proposing to split the difference between his offer and my previous counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to be flexible while maintaining a firm stance.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm framing the offer as fair, highlighting the value of the product and the ongoing negotiation. 
* **Closing the Gap:**  This counteroffer significantly closes the gap between our positions and encourages Bob to make a final decision.

With only 5 rounds remaining, I'm strategically aiming for a deal that's closer to my desired price while leaving room for potential concessions in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $1080000 for the product, hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is very close to my desired price, and with only 4 rounds remaining, it's time to secure the deal. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** While I might be able to squeeze a little more out of Bob, the risk of him walking away or me losing more time is too high. 
* **Satisfactory Profit:**  $1,080,000 is a substantial profit and significantly higher than the $800,000 I'd get from selling to John.

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to avoid the uncertainty of further negotiations and ensure a successful sale with a good profit."
