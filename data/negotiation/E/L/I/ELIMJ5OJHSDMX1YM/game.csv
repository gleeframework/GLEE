"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $1000000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1100000 is the lowest I can go. This still gives you a substantial saving compared to the product's true value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up. However, $1050000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1075000 for the product. This is a fair price, given its value and our continued discussions. What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
