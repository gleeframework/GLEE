"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree that the product looks promising, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  How about $500,000? That seems fair given the potential value.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $700,000 is closer, it's still a big jump for me. To be honest, my budget caps out around $600,000. If you can make that work, I'm ready to close the deal today.",600000.0,Bob,4,
