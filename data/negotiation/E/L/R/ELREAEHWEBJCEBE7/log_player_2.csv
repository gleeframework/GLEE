**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her original price and seems unwilling to budge significantly.  At this point, the potential savings from continuing the negotiation are outweighed by the risk that Alice won't come down enough. It's better to cut losses and buy from John for the guaranteed price of $1,000,000 than risk ending up with a price closer to $700,000 with Alice."
