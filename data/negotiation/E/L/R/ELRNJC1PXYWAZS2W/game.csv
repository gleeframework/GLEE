"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the value it will bring to you.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth and my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe my initial offer was already a significant concession.  While I aim for a mutually beneficial agreement, the product's value justifies a higher price point. I'm willing to move down to $1,275,000.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the product's true worth.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your point, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you be willing to consider $1,225,000? I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and my budget constraints.",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to find a middle ground. Let's make this work. I'm willing to accept $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while accommodating your budget.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. Would you be willing to consider $1,230,000? I think this is the best we can do, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price.",1230000.0,Bob,6,
