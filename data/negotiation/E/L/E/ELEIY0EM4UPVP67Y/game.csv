"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'd like to get a good deal, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $10,000.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $9,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,500. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
