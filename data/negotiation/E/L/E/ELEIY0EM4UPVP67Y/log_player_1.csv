Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation in the middle ground. It's above my minimum price of $8,000, but below Bob's perceived value of $12,000.  This creates room for negotiation while also showing that I am serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'd like to get a good deal, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum of $8,000, I believe I can do better. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $9,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,500. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than what John would pay, and it's within my desired range. I'm willing to accept it to close the deal."
