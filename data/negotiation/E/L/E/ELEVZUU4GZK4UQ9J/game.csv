"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident this will be a beneficial deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $750,000? That feels like a fair starting point.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $750,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  This product offers significant value, and I'm sure you see that. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?  This reflects my willingness to be flexible while still recognizing the product's worth.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, and I am willing to meet closer to your price point. However, $925,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $825,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the current market.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing some positive movement here, but we're still a ways off. I'm willing to come down slightly to $880,000. This is a firm offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",880000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this purchase, and I respect that. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price.  However, I believe in finding the right fit. My final offer is $865,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it situation.",865000.0,Alice,7,
