Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $750,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go.  This product offers significant value, and I'm sure you see that.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this purchase, and I respect that. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price.  However, I believe in finding the right fit. My final offer is $865,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it situation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $865,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $865,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball and her final offer of $865,000 is still above your maximum budget.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee she'll budge, especially with another potential buyer. Taking the safe route and purchasing from John for $800,000 ensures you stay within your budget and get the product."
