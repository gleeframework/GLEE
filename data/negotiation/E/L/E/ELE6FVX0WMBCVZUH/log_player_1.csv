I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This gives me a potential profit of $5,000 over my minimum acceptable price. While I don't know Bob's valuation, this offer allows for negotiation and gives him a good incentive to buy if he finds the product valuable. If he rejects, I can still sell to John for $10,000."
