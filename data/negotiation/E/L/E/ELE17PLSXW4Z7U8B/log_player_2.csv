"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,100,000 is still above his budget, and he has a better option with John.  He should counteroffer Alice to try and get a better price before resorting to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my minimum selling price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice has come down a bit, $1,000,000 is still over Bob's budget. He should continue to negotiate with Alice, as he has a better option with John if the negotiations fail."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a very fair price, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is now at $1,050,000, which is still above Bob's budget.  There is no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a lower price. Given that John is offering the product for $800,000, Bob should choose to buy from John to save the most money."
