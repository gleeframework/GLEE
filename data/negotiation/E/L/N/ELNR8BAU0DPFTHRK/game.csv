"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Is there any flexibility on your end?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,800 is still significantly below what the product is worth. To show my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to lower my price to $10,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
