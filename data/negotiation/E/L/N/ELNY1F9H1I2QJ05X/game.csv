"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value,  $1,100,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, which reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. I believe this represents a reasonable compromise and allows us both to benefit.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,025,000 is still too steep for me.  I'm ready to pay $900,000, which is a fair price given my budget and the product's potential.  Let's work towards an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing your eagerness to make this deal work, and I appreciate that.  However, we're still quite a bit apart.  To meet you closer to the middle, I'm willing to accept $975,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your final offer, but I'm still not able to go that high.  $950,000 is the absolute maximum I can afford at this time.  This represents a significant jump from my previous offer, showing my commitment to finding a solution.  Let's close the deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
