"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. It's a significant markup from my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is interested in paying a premium.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$100 is far too low for me. I'm not willing to sell at that price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial price, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  $175 is a fair price considering my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$120 is still too low.  I'm going to counteroffer again. I'm getting closer to John's offer, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $160. This is a significant compromise, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob to accept.  I'm getting close to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing out to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John for $150.  Bob's counteroffers are getting closer to my minimum, but I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price lower than $150. John is a sure thing, so I'm going to take the guaranteed profit."
