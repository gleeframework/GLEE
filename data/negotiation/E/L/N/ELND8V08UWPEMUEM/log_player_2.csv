"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $8,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is too high. Bob should reject the offer and proceed to the next round to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
``` 

Bob is starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming to get a significant discount.  This will likely lead to further negotiation, but it's a good starting point to see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better price. He has time on his side, and can still buy from John if he doesn't get a satisfactory deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  This should hopefully show Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still within his budget, and Alice's offer is still too high. He should continue to negotiate to try and get a better price. He can always buy from John for $8,000 if he doesn't get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

Bob is now making a counteroffer at his absolute maximum.  This shows Alice he's serious, and if she rejects it, he'll likely buy from John."
