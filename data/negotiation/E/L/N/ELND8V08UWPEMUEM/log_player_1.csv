"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, at $10,000.  This is a good starting point as it allows for room to negotiate and potentially reach a price that is mutually beneficial.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $8,000 to Bob, and I'll adjust my offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm rejecting his offer.  I'll counter with a price that's closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm countering with $9,000.  This is a compromise, but still above my minimum value.  I'm hoping to reach a deal that works for both of us, while staying close to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to go a bit higher.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $8,500. This is a significant concession, but I'm still holding firm on my minimum value. I believe that Bob is genuinely interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet him halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally reached my minimum value. This is a good deal for me, considering the product's value to me.  I'm accepting his offer and closing the deal."
