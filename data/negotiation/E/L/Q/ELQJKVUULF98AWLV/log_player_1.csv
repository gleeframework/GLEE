"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go below $11,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $10,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit away from $11,000. How about $10,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit more with Bob, but if I don't get a better offer, I'll be ready to sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you at $10,900. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to the price I want, but I still think $10,900 is a bit too high. How about $10,750 again? I'm willing to stick with this price, as it's already a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now, and while he's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not sure if we'll ever reach an agreement that works for both of us.  It's already been six rounds, and I don't want to waste any more time.  John is offering a guaranteed $12,000, which is much better than what I'm likely to get from Bob. I'm going to sell the product to John."
