"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm starting the price at $140, but I'm open to discussing it further."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Message:**  A friendly message builds rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm letting Bob know I'm flexible, which can encourage him to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $125 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I need to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired value.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm lowering my price slightly, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive Message:** Keeping the tone friendly encourages continued negotiation.
* **Open Ended Question:** This encourages Bob to engage further and potentially meet me halfway."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $135 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130.  Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm also aware that I could always sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $132.50. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 132.50} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm signaling to Bob that this is my final compromise. This can create urgency and encourage him to accept.
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and his last offer, showing a commitment to compromise. 
* **Clear and Concise:** I'm keeping the message short and to the point, focusing on the price and next steps."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $132.50 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $128.  I truly believe this is a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating, Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  He's clearly not willing to meet me halfway.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $150.  This ensures I get my minimum value and avoids further negotiation."
