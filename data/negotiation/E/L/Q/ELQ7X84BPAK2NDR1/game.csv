"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2000000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go up to $1000000 at this time. I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to negotiate.  Let's meet in the middle at $1750000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1750000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1250000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering our previous discussions.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your commitment to finding a solution. While $1250000 is closer, it's still below my minimum. To show good faith, I'm willing to drop my price to $1600000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a price that works for both of us. However, $1600000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1400000. This is a significant increase from my last offer and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
