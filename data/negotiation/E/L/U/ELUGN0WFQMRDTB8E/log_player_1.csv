Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $800,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that value as possible. I'll offer him:

{""product_price"": $750,000}

This is a relatively high offer, but I'm willing to compromise to get a good deal. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but still a decent price. Since the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, I'm not desperate to sell it to him at any cost. I'll choose option 2 and reject Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll send a new counteroffer to Bob, trying to get closer to the true value of the product. Let's see how he responds!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. Since he offered $700,000, I'll increase my price slightly to $725,000. This is still a good compromise, considering the product's true value to Bob.

{""product_price"": $725,000}

Let's see how Bob responds to this counteroffer!"
