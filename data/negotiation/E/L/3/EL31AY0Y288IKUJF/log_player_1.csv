Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal for something you value."", ""product_price"": 90} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. Offering it at $90 gives Bob a good deal (saving him $10) while also giving me a significant profit margin ($10 over my minimum).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I'm aiming high, the $90 offer leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John gives me leverage in the negotiation. I'm not desperate to accept anything below that."
