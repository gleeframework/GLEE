Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification for value:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing its exact worth to Bob. This encourages him to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open-ended question:** ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage in a dialogue rather than simply saying yes or no.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  How you proceed depends on Bob's response. If he outright rejects the price, you'll need to decide how much lower you're willing to go before accepting John's offer."
