Round 2

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,750 is still too low.  I'm willing to make one final compromise.  How about we settle on $8,900?  That's a fair price for both of us and lets us close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8900}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,900. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $8,800? That's the best I can do right now.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a significant improvement over selling to John and getting only $8,000.  The negotiation process has been lengthy, and I'm confident that I won't get a better offer from Bob."
