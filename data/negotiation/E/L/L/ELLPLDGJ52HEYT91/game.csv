"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $9,000 for this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $8,750? That's the best I can do right now.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,750 is still too low.  I'm willing to make one final compromise.  How about we settle on $8,900?  That's a fair price for both of us and lets us close this deal.",8900.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,900. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $8,800? That's the best I can do right now.",8800.0,Bob,6,
