{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115} 
``` 

I'm offering the product at $115. This is a good starting point as it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also below the minimum I'm willing to accept, allowing me some leeway for counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to sell the product, $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, even though it's closer. I will reject his offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 100}
