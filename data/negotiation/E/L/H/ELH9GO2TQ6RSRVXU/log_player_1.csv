Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering it's worth at least $10,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a significant discount for Bob:** He values the product at $8,000, so $9,500 is still a good deal for him.
* **It's not too low for me:** I still get a good price for the product while leaving room for negotiation. 
* **It establishes a clear starting point:**  This gives Bob a concrete offer to consider and allows us to begin the negotiation process.

I'm confident this offer will open up the conversation with Bob and lead to a successful negotiation!"
