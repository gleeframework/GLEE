Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:** We want to get as close to $150 as possible, since that's our guaranteed sale price with John. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Starting at $140 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit margin. 
* **Psychological pricing:**  $140 seems like a ""deal"" compared to a round number like $150, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept.

If Bob rejects this offer, we can always revert to selling to John for our minimum acceptable price."
