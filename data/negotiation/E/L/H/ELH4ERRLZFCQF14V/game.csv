"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. Let's start with $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but I need to maintain a minimum price for the product. I am willing to consider $140 as the price for this round.",140.0,Alice,3,
