"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $650,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you consider $725,000? I feel that's a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the value while working for me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial.  I'm prepared to make my final offer at $875,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair balance between its worth and your initial interest. ",875000.0,Alice,5,
