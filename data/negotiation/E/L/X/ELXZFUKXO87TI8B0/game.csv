"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you. To make this a smooth transaction, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. Considering its worth to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This price reflects a fair value for the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. I'm eager to finalize this deal, so let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,250,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand the product's worth, $1,250,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a substantial amount and demonstrates my seriousness in acquiring the product.  This price allows for a mutually beneficial outcome and would finalize our deal.  What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, the product's value remains higher than your current offer. To meet you halfway, I propose a price of $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as it reflects the absolute minimum I can accept.  It's a fair deal that benefits us both.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
