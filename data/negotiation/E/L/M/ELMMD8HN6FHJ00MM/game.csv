"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product, valued at over $1 million to me.  I'm confident it's worth even more to you.  My initial offer is $1,250,000.  Let's start the conversation!",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,250,000 is more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000.  This is a fair price, given my valuation and your willingness to sell.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise, given our respective valuations.  Let's try to find common ground here.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value we're both seeing in this product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
