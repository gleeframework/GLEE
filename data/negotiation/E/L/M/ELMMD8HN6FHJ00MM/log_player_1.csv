Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product, valued at over $1 million to me.  I'm confident it's worth even more to you.  My initial offer is $1,250,000.  Let's start the conversation!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,250,000 is more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000.  This is a fair price, given my valuation and your willingness to sell.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to accept it yet. I have 10 rounds and can still negotiate with Bob or sell to John, so I will make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise, given our respective valuations.  Let's try to find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value we're both seeing in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than what John is offering and still gets me closer to my desired price. I'll accept this offer."
