"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise given the value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $750,000?  That's a fair offer considering we're both making concessions.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value and the concessions I've made so far.",950000.0,Alice,5,
