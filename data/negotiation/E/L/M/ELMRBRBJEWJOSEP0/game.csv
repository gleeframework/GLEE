"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let's start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,100,000. This is a compromise that should be more acceptable to both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway there. How about we settle at $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my minimum price. Let's try $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your bottom line, but I'm afraid I can't meet that price.  My absolute highest is $975,000.  If we can make a deal work at that price, I'm ready to close today.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a complimentary maintenance package. This should give you added value and peace of mind. The price remains at $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the additional offers but those extras aren't that valuable to me. If you're willing to come down to $1,000,000, we can close the deal today.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've made significant concessions and added value to the deal, but I'm still not willing to meet your price at $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $1,025,000. I'm not going to go any lower than that. This is my final offer.",1025000.0,Alice,9,
