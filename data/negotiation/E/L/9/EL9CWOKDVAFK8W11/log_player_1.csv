Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm initially offering it to you for $19,000.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 19000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting with a higher price ($19,000) gives you a buffer. 
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** The message is framed to gauge Bob's interest while leaving room for negotiation. If Bob outright rejects the offer, you can lower the price slightly. 
* **""Unique value""**:  This phrasing subtly hints that the product might be worth more than Bob initially thinks, potentially encouraging him to accept a higher price.

**Important:** The goal is to find the highest price Bob is willing to pay that is still above your minimum ($15,000).  You can always negotiate down, but you can't go back up!"
