"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to own this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $2,200,000 is far too high for me. I understand the product's value, but my budget simply doesn't allow for that. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the benefits I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move a bit closer to your price range. Would you consider $1,950,000? I believe this still reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,950,000 is still too far from where I can realistically go. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price given my budget constraints and the value I see in the product. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but my asking price reflects the true market value of this product.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,700,000 is still out of my price range. I'm  willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my sincere interest in acquiring this product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a realistic price.  To be frank, selling this product for less than $1,500,000 is a significant sacrifice for me.  I'm willing to accept $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value this product offers.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, but $1,400,000 is still more than I can afford. I'm willing to go to $1,200,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential benefits it brings.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
