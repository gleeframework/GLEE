"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the value this product brings.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000. How about $925,000?  This leaves some room for both of us to feel good about the deal.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'll accept $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're not going to be able to agree on a price. I'm willing to come down to $890,000 for the product, but that's my final offer. It's the best I can do, and it's still a fair price considering its value to you. If you're not interested, I'll have to look elsewhere for a buyer.",890000.0,Alice,7,
