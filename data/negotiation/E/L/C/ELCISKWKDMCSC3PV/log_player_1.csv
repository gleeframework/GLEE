Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000.  This is a strong opening position that allows for negotiation while still reflecting the product's value to me.  I'm confident Bob will counteroffer, giving me a chance to gauge his interest and potentially arrive at a mutually beneficial price.  If his counteroffer is too low, I have the option to reject and make a new counteroffer, or simply accept John's offer of $800,000 as a backup plan."
