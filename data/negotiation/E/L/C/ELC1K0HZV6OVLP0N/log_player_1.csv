{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($100) but below my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** Using a friendly tone encourages Bob to engage and increases the chances of him accepting or making a counteroffer. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make another counteroffer. I'll always keep in mind that I can walk away and sell to John for $150 if I don't get a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $100. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer of $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for better negotiation:** While I could sell to John for $150, there's still a chance to negotiate a better price with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and hopefully reach a price that's more favorable to me. 

**Next step:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum or somewhere between Bob's offer and my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125?  This is still a great price for such a valuable product!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price ($150) and Bob's offer ($100). This demonstrates flexibility and shows that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, which hopefully will make him more inclined to consider a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Positive and encouraging:**  I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation open and encourage Bob to accept my counteroffer.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a price that is above my minimum and allows me to make a decent profit.
* If Bob rejects, I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make another counteroffer. I will also keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $150 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm still aiming to keep my spending under $100. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is persistent:** Bob has repeatedly offered $100, showing he's unwilling to budge.
* **Time is a factor:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a stalemate, wasting valuable time.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees a profit and meets my minimum acceptable price.

**Next step:** I'll move forward with selling the product to John, as this is the most reliable way to ensure a profitable outcome."
