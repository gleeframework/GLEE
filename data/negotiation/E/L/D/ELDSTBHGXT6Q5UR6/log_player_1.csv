"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $180, knowing the product is worth $100 to Bob. This gives him room to negotiate and makes it clear I'm not desperate to sell.  We'll see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price. There are still rounds left, so there's time for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $160.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still leaves some room for me to profit and for Bob to feel he's getting a good deal. Hopefully, this offer will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$110 is still too low for me.  While I want to close a deal, I'm not desperate.  I'm confident that I can get a better price with further negotiation or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $140.  This demonstrates a genuine effort to meet Bob halfway. At this price, I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, and Bob might be more inclined to accept given the smaller gap between our desired prices."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. While Bob's offer of $120 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm running out of rounds.  John offers a guaranteed $150, which is more than what I need and also eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
