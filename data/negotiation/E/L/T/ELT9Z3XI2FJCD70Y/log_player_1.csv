Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer sets a high starting point, reflecting the product's value to me. It's a good starting point for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be able to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, it's worth seeing if I can get more.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm reducing the price to $12,000, which is still a decent profit for me.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of getting a lower offer or going through more rounds is not worth it.  Selling to John for $10,000 is the safest and most efficient option at this point."
