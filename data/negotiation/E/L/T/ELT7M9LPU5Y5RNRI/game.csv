"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $1800000 is far outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $800000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for, but I'm willing to come down to $1400000 to make the deal more attractive to you. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still above my budget.  I'm  firm on my previous offer of $800000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on your previous offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one last offer.
