"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It's better to counteroffer or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $1,800,000 is far outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $800000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for, but I'm willing to come down to $1400000 to make the deal more attractive to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate further. You have a good chance of getting a better price, and you can always buy from John if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget.  I'm  firm on my previous offer of $800,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's not let this opportunity slip away."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're firm on your previous offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is closer to your budget, you still have room to negotiate.  It's worth trying to counteroffer again, and you always have the option of buying from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1,200,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  I'm eager to close this deal, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go below $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still worth pushing for a better deal.  You have the option of buying from John, so there's no pressure to accept a price that's still too high.  A counteroffer might get you closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one last offer. I'll sell the product to you for $1100000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high. You have one more round with her, but it's unlikely she will come down to a price you are comfortable with.  John's offer is your best option at this point. You can save $300,000 by buying from John."
