"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $12,000 and I'm still making a profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $14,000. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!",15500.0,Alice,5,
