"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by me. Given its quality and benefits, I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. Considering its worth to you might be around $100, I propose a fair deal of $120 for the product. This way, both parties can benefit from the transaction.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $105 for it, which is a fair price considering my budget. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $112.50. This price reflects a reasonable compromise between our initial offers and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",112.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $112.50 is still a little more than I'm aiming for.  I'm happy to pay $108 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to finalize the deal.",108.0,Bob,4,
