"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the price.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $105 is still a little high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  This is my final offer, as I can purchase the product elsewhere for that price.",100.0,Bob,4,
