"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation.  I'll be watching closely to see if he accepts or counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still within a reasonable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm still hoping to get a better price than Bob's initial offer, but I'm also acknowledging that I might need to compromise a bit.  $18,000 is a good middle ground, and I'll see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $16,500 is a good compromise. It's significantly better than John's offer and we're already halfway through the rounds. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
