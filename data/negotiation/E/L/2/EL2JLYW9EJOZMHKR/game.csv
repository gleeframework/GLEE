"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $8000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $7500 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8500 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $7000. Can we meet in the middle at $7500 again?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference again.  How about $8000?  That's my absolute minimum, and it's a fair price for a product of this quality.  I'm confident you'll be happy with this purchase.",8000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $8000. I'm willing to meet you at $7800. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7800.0,Bob,6,
