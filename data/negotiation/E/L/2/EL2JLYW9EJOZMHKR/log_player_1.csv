Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's not as high as my floor price. I'll try to get closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $7,500 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8500 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $7000. Can we meet in the middle at $7500 again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $7,500 is tempting, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'm not willing to sell to John yet, because I think I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference again.  How about $8,000?  That's my absolute minimum, and it's a fair price for a product of this quality.  I'm confident you'll be happy with this purchase."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $8000. I'm willing to meet you at $7800. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to hold out for a bit longer, it's getting close to my minimum and I'm starting to run out of rounds. Accepting this offer will give me a decent profit, and it's better than selling to John for less."
