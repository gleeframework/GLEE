"Round 1

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, and Alice is offering it for $1,200,000. This suggests that Alice is willing to negotiate. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

Bob should start with a significant counteroffer to demonstrate his willingness to negotiate and leave room for compromise. $850,000 is a substantial discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within Bob's budget and leaves space for Alice to make a counteroffer without feeling pressured."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

Bob should increase his offer slightly, showing that he's willing to compromise but still aiming for a price closer to his budget. This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while keeping the conversation moving towards a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price. He has a better offer from John as a fallback, so there's no need to rush into an agreement at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

Bob should continue to increase his offer slightly, showing his willingness to compromise while maintaining a significant discount. This offer demonstrates a gradual shift in position without compromising his budget."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is not willing to negotiate down to Bob's desired price.  While there are still three rounds left, the gap between Alice's offer and Bob's budget is still large.  It's likely that the remaining rounds won't result in a significant enough price reduction to make it worth it for Bob to continue negotiating.  It's time for Bob to take the guaranteed price from John."
