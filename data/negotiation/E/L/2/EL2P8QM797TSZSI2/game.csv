"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $750,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $750,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000. This is a fair price that still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not ready to accept $825,000 just yet. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $837,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you.",837500.0,Alice,5,
