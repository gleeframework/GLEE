Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm Alice, and I have a unique product that I believe you'll find very valuable. It's worth a significant amount to both of us, at least $1,200,000. I'm offering it to you first at a price of $1,500,000. This is a chance to acquire something truly special. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to both parties, starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** Aiming for $1,500,000 gives Alice the opportunity to potentially earn $300,000 more than her guaranteed sale to John.
* **Backup Option:**  Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't be forced to go below her minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:** This strategy balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob will reject the initial offer, but the potential for higher profit makes it a worthwhile approach."
