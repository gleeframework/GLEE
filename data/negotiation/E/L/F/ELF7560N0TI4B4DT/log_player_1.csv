"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $1,800,000, we set a high anchor point for the negotiation. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it will likely influence his counteroffer to be higher than if we had started lower.
* **Confident Tone:** The message is phrased confidently and emphasizes the value of the product. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving room for negotiation over the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $800,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both our valuation and his own stated valuation of the product. Accepting this would be a substantial loss. We know John provides a guaranteed $1,200,000, making Bob's offer far from acceptable at this stage.  We need to steer the negotiation closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair,  let's consider $1,500,000. This reflects the product's worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:**  We reduced our price by $300,000 (from $1,800,000 to $1,500,000). This demonstrates flexibility but avoids a drastic drop that might signal desperation or significantly undervalue the product.
* **Justification:**  We're reiterating the product's value while emphasizing fairness and a mutually beneficial outcome. This subtly reminds Bob of its worth and aims to shift his perception of a ""fair"" price.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  Crucially, we remain comfortably above our $1,200,000 minimum (John's offer) and Bob's known valuation, preserving our position for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1,500,000 is still a bit steep. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate. He's acknowledged the product's value and is willing to move closer to a reasonable price.  We are only $100,000 away from our guaranteed offer from John, so we'll aim to push Bob a bit further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. How about we settle on $1,300,000? That's a significant reduction on my part, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** We're proposing a price close to the midpoint between his offer ($1,100,000) and our previous ask ($1,500,000). This makes it appear like a very reasonable compromise.
* **Highlighting Concessions:**  By pointing out our previous reduction, we're reminding him of our movement and encouraging him to reciprocate.
* **Above John's Offer:** Importantly, we're still aiming for a price that beats our guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.
* **Sense of Urgency:** With fewer rounds remaining,  we want to nudge Bob towards a decision without seeming overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I feel like we're close to a deal. How about $1,150,000? That's splitting the difference and seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is above our guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. Accepting this offer secures a profit.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While we could try to negotiate further, Bob is clearly aiming for a price around $1,150,000.  The potential gain from further negotiation is unlikely to outweigh the risk of him walking away. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation and allows us to move on.  Every round carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or Alice misjudging the situation. 
 
Taking a slightly lower profit with a more certain outcome is a sound strategy at this point."
