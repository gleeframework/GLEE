"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $800,000.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair,  let's consider $1,500,000. This reflects the product's worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1,500,000 is still a bit steep. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I think that's a fair offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. How about we settle on $1,300,000? That's a significant reduction on my part, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I feel like we're close to a deal. How about $1,150,000? That's splitting the difference and seems like a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
