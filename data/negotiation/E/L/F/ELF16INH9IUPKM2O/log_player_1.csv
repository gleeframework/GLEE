# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $950,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

This feels closer to a fair valuation for me.
