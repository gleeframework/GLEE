"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $90 is too low for me.  How about we settle at $130? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we settle at $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
