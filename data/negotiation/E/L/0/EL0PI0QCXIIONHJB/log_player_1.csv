Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $20,000. I believe it will be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than its price indicates."", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still staying above your minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:**  By emphasizing the product's value to Bob, I'm aiming to justify the high initial price. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and his potential willingness to pay a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product. Please consider this as my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I started high, Bob's offer of $15,000 matches my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee I can negotiate a higher price from him, and I risk him walking away entirely if I counter. Accepting his offer ensures I get my minimum and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
