Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

**Reasoning:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate.  This counteroffer is a smaller step, showing that you're serious about getting a deal, but also acknowledging her previous offer.  It's a good balance between being firm and being reasonable."
