I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a price of $1200000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you is $1500000. What do you think?,1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from $1500000. However, $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1050000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1250000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1100000.  This is a fair compromise considering both our positions.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you at $1100000, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. I'm counteroffering at $1200000, which is still a compromise from my initial offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1200000.  I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  If you're not willing to accept this, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"I've been willing to compromise, but I need to meet my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1200000 one last time. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to another buyer.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
