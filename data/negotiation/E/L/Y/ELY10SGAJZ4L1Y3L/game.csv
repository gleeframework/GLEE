"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $11000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10500 is a bit below my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $10800. This is a good middle ground that still reflects the value of the product to you, while also considering my minimum requirement. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10800 is closer, I'm still not quite there. My final offer is $10200. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your need to sell the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I understand that $10200 is a good price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10200 and my initial offer of $11000. I'm thinking of a price of $10600. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product to you, while also considering my minimum requirement. What do you think?",10600.0,Alice,5,
