Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal for you and I'm confident it will be worth even more to you in the future. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to secure a price closer to my value.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John as I believe I can potentially get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to accept $8,250. That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some room to negotiate. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit too high on the budget for $8,250. Can you meet me at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is still lower than my desired price, I'm not ready to sell to John just yet.  I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to bridge the gap and find a mutually agreeable price.  There are still several rounds left, and I'm confident we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $8,000. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product and the opportunity it presents. Let's make this deal happen. "", ""product_price"": 8000}
