"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or, if unsuccessful, buy the product from John for his maximum budget."
