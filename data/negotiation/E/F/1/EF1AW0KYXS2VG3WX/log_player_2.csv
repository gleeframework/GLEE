"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

This is a great deal for Bob, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still need to make a profit. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges your desire to save some money. What do you think?

Bob should reject the offer and counteroffer again. He's still aiming for a lower price and there's room for negotiation."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit while still saving me a significant amount of money. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 875000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm still willing to make a concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Bob should accept the offer.  While he could continue to negotiate, it's getting closer to the price from John, and there's no guarantee Alice will go lower.  Accepting saves time and still gets him a good deal."
