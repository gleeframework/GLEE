"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less than that.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  I believe this is still a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still need to make a profit. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges your desire to save some money. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit while still saving me a significant amount of money. Let's make this deal happen!",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm still willing to make a concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
