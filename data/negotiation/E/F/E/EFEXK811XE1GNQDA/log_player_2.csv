"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe this product will bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $800,000?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you have a budget in mind, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000, but I'm not willing to go lower than that. I'm confident you'll find the product's value justifies the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly unwilling to go below her product's value to her. Since you can buy it from John for the same price, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer now.  You won't get a better deal in this scenario."
