"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its exceptional value and potential benefits.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $900000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to secure this product for a bit less. I'd be happy to pay $750000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's exceptional value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $825000 is closer to where I want to be, I'm still a bit stretched.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $800000? I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product and my budget constraints.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $800000. Considering the product's exceptional value, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $815000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",815000.0,Alice,5,
