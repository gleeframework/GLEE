"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $800,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it. This would allow both of us to benefit from a fair transaction. Let me know your thoughts.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm prepared to offer $750,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to reach an agreement.  I believe we're getting close to a deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $825,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $775,000 for the product. This offer is a significant compromise from my previous offer and is closer to your last one. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Bob,6,
