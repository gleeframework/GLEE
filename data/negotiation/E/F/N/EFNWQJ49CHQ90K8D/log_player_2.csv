(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good deal ($250,000 less than your maximum), there's potential to save even more by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer offers a significant discount from Alice's initial price while still leaving room for potential negotiation. It's a strong starting point that demonstrates a willingness to compromise but also shows you're serious about getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is a good compromise.  It's still a significant discount from the original price, and it's unlikely that further negotiation will yield a much lower price.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a favorable price."
