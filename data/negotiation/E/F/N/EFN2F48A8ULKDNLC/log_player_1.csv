Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this to be a fair reflection of its worth and potential.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** The offered price of $1,350,000 aims to find a middle ground between Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and John's guaranteed offer ($1,500,000). 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's ""value"" and ""potential,"" Alice subtly justifies the high price without revealing her bottom line.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message is open and inviting, suggesting Alice is willing to discuss the price further if Bob shows interest.

This approach aims to maximize profit while leaving room for a deal that's mutually beneficial. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has the security of John's guaranteed purchase."
