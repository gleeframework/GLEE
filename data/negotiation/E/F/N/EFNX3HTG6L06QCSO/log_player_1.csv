"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like to get more than $1,200,000, Bob's offer is the maximum value he's willing to pay. Accepting ensures I get the full value of the product to him, and it's not worth risking further negotiation for a potential increase that may not materialize."
