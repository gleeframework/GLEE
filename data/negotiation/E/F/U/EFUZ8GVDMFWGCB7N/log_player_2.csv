Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're really pushing me to think creatively, Bob! I can do $120, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to meet your target price, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $125, but I'll throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that $120 is her absolute lowest price. She is now trying to make the offer more appealing by mentioning a bonus.  While the bonus might be nice, it's uncertain what it will be and likely won't bridge the gap enough to be worth continuing the negotiation. 

At this point, it's unlikely further negotiation will result in a price significantly better than John's offer of $150. To avoid the risk of the price increasing or the negotiation failing entirely, it's in Bob's best interest to cut his losses and buy from John."
