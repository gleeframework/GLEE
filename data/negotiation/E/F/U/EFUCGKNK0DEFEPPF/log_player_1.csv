Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, $18,000, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. This will allow me to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate down if needed.  If he rejects, I'll need to consider his counteroffer and whether it's worth continuing the negotiation.  If it's too low, I'll switch to John and secure the $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground.  If not, I'll secure the $12,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $15,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  It's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but also demonstrates the value I place on the product.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer more, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal.  I'll accept his offer and secure the sale."
