# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. I know it's a high price, but it's truly worth it. I'm confident you'll see the value in it.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and the value I see in it."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This price reflects the value I see in our potential partnership, and I'm confident this deal will be beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints, but $900000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and our potential for future collaborations.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $950,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer and a price that reflects the value of this product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 925000}
