"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $14,000, which reflects its true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating with Alice or explore other options."
