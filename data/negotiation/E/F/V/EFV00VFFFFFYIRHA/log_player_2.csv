"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than $150 from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  Offering $105 is a significant discount from Alice's offer of $120, but it still leaves room for a potential compromise. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is less than John's price, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer of $105, suggesting a willingness to compromise. Rejecting this offer allows for further negotiation to potentially reach a price closer to Bob's desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible, but is also recognizing that Alice is willing to come down in price. This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her last offer of $125 and Bob's previous offer of $105. This shows a willingness to reach an agreement while still maintaining a goal of a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved her offer closer to Bob's desired price, and at $130, the product is still worth it to Bob as it's cheaper than buying from John.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away entirely or refusing further offers is high. Accepting at this point ensures Bob gets the product within his budget."
