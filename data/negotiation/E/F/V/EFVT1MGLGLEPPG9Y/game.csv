"I understand you're interested in the product, but $125 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm counteroffering at $137.50. Let me know if that's something you'd be comfortable with.",137.5,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a bit more than $130. I'm counteroffering at $135. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",135.0,Alice,5,
