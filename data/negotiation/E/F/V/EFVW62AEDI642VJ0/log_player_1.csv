Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for sale. I think you'll find it very useful. I'm asking for $180 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it, which is the price John is offering. Can you meet me in the middle at $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
