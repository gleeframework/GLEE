"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high with $10,000.  It's a bold move, but I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his upper limit.  If he accepts, fantastic! I've made a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$7,000 is below my minimum. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still keeps me above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a little more. I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet.  There's still potential to get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is a significant drop from my last offer, but it's still above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob is finally ready to close the deal. If he rejects, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  We've gone through several rounds, and it seems we're at an impasse.  I've already offered a significant discount, and I don't want to keep going back and forth.  John is a safe bet, and it's time to move on."
