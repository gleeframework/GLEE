"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. This reflects the maximum value I see in the product for my purposes. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I have to consider the minimum value I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your initial offer.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1400000 is still beyond my budget. To make progress, I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000. This reflects a genuine interest in the product, but I can't go any higher.  I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. While $1100000 is closer, it's still outside my budget. To find common ground, I'm offering $950000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement. Let's see if we can bridge the remaining gap.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to see a bit more movement from you. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! To finalize a deal, I'm offering $1000000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the maximum I can reasonably spend.  I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and the progress we've made in our negotiations. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the point of diminishing returns. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to see a bit more movement from you. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
