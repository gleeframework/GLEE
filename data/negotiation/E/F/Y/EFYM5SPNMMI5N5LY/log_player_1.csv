I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,150,000. This price is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than Bob's estimated value but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It also shows my confidence in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still reflects the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. While I'm open to negotiation, I believe it's unlikely we'll reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000, securing a price closer to my initial valuation."
