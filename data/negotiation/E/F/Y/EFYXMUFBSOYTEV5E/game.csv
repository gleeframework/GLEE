"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you valuing the product at $10,000 for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this happen!",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth more to me than that. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant about $11,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This feels like a fair deal for both of us, considering the value to me. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your proposal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a fair price. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think the product's value to me is closer to $11,250. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
