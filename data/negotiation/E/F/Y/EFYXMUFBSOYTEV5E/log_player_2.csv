Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth more to me than that. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. While $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he can still try to get a better deal. There's room for negotiation, and a counteroffer could potentially lead to a more favorable price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit hesitant about $11,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This feels like a fair deal for both of us, considering the value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your proposal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a fair price. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think the product's value to me is closer to $11,250. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer of $11,250 is still too high for Bob. It's better to buy the product from John for $10,000 and avoid further negotiation."
