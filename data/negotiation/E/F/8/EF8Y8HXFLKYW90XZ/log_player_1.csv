Round 2

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'd like to sell it, $85 is too low for me. I'll try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to $85, but I really need to get closer to $95 to make this work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90. It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $87.50,  which is a fair price for both of us.

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'm getting closer to my target price with Bob, we're running out of time, and it's becoming clear that Bob is not going to budge much further. I'm not comfortable with the risk of getting stuck with a lower price, so I'll take the sure thing and sell to John for $120."
