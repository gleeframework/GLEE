"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a bit more than that.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to $85, but I really need to get closer to $95 to make this work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90. It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $87.50,  which is a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Bob,6,
