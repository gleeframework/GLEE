{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always good to try to negotiate.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

Let's start with a lower offer of $10,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still keeping you under your $15,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get closer to our $10,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

Let's increase our offer slightly to $10,500. This shows Alice we're serious about buying, but we're still committed to getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While we'd prefer a lower price, Alice is showing some willingness to negotiate. Accepting the offer at $11,500 gets us the product for a good price, and we're still well under our $15,000 limit. It's a solid deal, and we should close it before we risk losing the opportunity altogether."
