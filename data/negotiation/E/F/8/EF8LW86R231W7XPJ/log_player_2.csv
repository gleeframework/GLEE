Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not going to meet you at $95, Bob. I've already told you I can do $97.50, and that's the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product. If you're not willing to meet me at $97.50, I'm going to have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5

Alice is being stubborn, but $97.5 is still a decent price for me. It's only slightly above my target price and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  I'll take the offer."
