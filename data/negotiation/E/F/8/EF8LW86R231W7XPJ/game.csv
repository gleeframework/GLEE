"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. Is that something you'd be interested in?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. How about $90?  That's still a good deal for you and a fair price for me.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this sale. I can do $95, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and I give you $92.50?  I think that's a fair compromise.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I can do $97.50, but that's as close to $95 as I can get. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down in price.  $97.50 is getting closer to what I can do, but I'm still hoping for a bit lower.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I can make a decision right away.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not going to meet you at $95, Bob. I've already told you I can do $97.50, and that's the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product. If you're not willing to meet me at $97.50, I'm going to have to consider other options.",97.5,Alice,7,
