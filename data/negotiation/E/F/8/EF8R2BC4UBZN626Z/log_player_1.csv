``` 

This is a high starting point, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'll keep John in mind as a backup if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is valuable, that price is a little high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum value. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  That's a fair compromise I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  While it's getting closer, I'm not comfortable accepting it yet. I'll counteroffer again and try to bridge the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000.

Round 6

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,280,000 is still a bit too low. Let's try $1,320,000.  It's a reasonable compromise, and I think we're both close to a deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1320000}

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000.  This product is worth more than that to me, and I believe it's worth more to you too, given your initial interest. How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000? This gives us both a good deal and allows us to close this transaction.  Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
