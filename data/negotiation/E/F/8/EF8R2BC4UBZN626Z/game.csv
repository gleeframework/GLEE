"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is valuable, that price is a little high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is just too far below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This gives you a great price while still allowing me to get a reasonable return. Let's see if we can make this work!",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  That's a fair compromise I think.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. Let's try to find common ground here.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,280,000. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,280,000 is still a bit too low. Let's try $1,320,000.  It's a reasonable compromise, and I think we're both close to a deal.  What do you say?",1320000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if it works for you.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000.  This product is worth more than that to me, and I believe it's worth more to you too, given your initial interest. How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000? This gives us both a good deal and allows us to close this transaction.  Let's make it happen.",1350000.0,Alice,9,
