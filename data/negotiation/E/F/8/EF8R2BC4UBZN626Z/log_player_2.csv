Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is just too far below what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This gives you a great price while still allowing me to get a reasonable return. Let's see if we can make this work!

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000.  This product is worth more than that to me, and I believe it's worth more to you too, given your initial interest. How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000? This gives us both a good deal and allows us to close this transaction.  Let's make it happen.

Explanation:

Alice is stubbornly sticking to a price point well above your fallback option.  You've been steadily increasing your offer, signaling a strong desire to purchase.  Alice returning to her previous offer of $1,350,000 after you stated your final offer suggests she's unlikely to move significantly lower.  At this point, you're better off cutting your losses and taking the guaranteed deal with John for $1,000,000."
