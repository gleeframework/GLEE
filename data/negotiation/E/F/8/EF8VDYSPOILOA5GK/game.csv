"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's significant value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  How about $1,325,000?  This shows my genuine interest in buying the product while staying within my budget.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
