# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I'm confident that you'll recognize its worth and find this a fair starting point for our discussion.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I must be upfront - $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  I've poured my heart and soul into this product, and I know its worth. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still respecting the value of what I'm offering.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're passionate about your product, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to offer $950,000.
