Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,300,000 is far too high for my budget.  Given my own research and the market value, I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also allowing us both to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Let's meet in the middle at $975,000. This price acknowledges the value of your product while remaining within my financial constraints.  It's a fair and reasonable offer that allows us both to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offers are incrementally increasing and still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. At this point, continuing the negotiation poses a risk of leaving money on the table.  It's a better strategy to take John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000."
