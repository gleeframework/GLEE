"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I'm confident that you'll recognize its worth and find this a fair starting point for our discussion.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,300,000 is far too high for my budget.  Given my own research and the market value, I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also allowing us both to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I must be upfront - $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  I've poured my heart and soul into this product, and I know its worth. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still respecting the value of what I'm offering.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're passionate about your product, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in your product. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

This is my final offer, as it's crucial for me to receive a fair price for the time, effort, and resources I've invested.  I believe this is a compelling offer that benefits us both.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
