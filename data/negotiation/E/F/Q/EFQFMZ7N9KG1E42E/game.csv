"I'm interested in the product, but I think $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $9750.  What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9750 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9200. Can you consider that?",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9200 is still below my minimum price.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to drop to $9400. This is my final offer.",9400.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one more attempt to negotiate. Can you consider a price of $9000?",9000.0,Bob,6,
