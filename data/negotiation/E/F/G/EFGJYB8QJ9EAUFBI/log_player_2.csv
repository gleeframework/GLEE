# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. $900,000 is a good price, but Bob can likely do better.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $850,000 is a good price, especially considering the value of the product to him.  He's already saved $350,000 from the original asking price and further negotiation might not yield a significant improvement."
