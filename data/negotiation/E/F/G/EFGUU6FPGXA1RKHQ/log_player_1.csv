"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's in great condition and I believe it will be worth every penny to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm looking to save some money, but I'm still willing to pay a fair price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $7,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,500.  This is still a great deal for you considering its value to you is $10,000."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $7,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of not reaching a mutually acceptable price is high.  It's better to sell to John for $8,000 and guarantee a sale."
