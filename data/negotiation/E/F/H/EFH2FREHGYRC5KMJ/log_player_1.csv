{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He's willing to pay $8,000, so $9,500 gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to accept no less than $10,000, so you have room to lower the price if needed.
* **It shows good faith:** You're not starting at a ridiculous price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 

Remember, this is just the first step. You'll need to be flexible and adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price.  You have room to negotiate with Bob, and you should try to get closer to your target price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
