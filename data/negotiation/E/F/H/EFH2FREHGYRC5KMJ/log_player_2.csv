"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget, and while there's a chance she might come down further, it's not worth the risk of continued negotiation. Buying from John guarantees a price within Bob's budget."
