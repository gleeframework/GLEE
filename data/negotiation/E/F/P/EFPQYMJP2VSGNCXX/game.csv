"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. Can you think about going down to $106? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",106.0,Bob,6,
