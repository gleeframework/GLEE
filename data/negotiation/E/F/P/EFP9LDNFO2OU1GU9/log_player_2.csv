(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While $900,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still a significant amount.  
* **There's room for negotiation.** Bob has 10 rounds to try and get a better price.  
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** Bob shouldn't rush into this until he's exhausted all other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:** Bob wants to show Alice he's serious about getting a good deal.
* **Significant discount:** A $200,000 discount from Alice's initial offer is substantial.
* **Strategic underbid:**  Bob knows Alice's minimum is $800,000, so this offer is still reasonable. 

By making a bold counteroffer, Bob hopes to get Alice to reconsider her position quickly and potentially start a negotiation closer to his desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she has moved slightly closer to Bob's desired price, $950,000 is still above the middle ground between their initial values. 
* **Bob is still better off negotiating.**  There are 7 rounds remaining, giving him time to try and lower the price further.
* **Buying from John is still a fallback option.**  There's no need to rush into that decision just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is willing to move slightly from his previous offer, showing he's willing to negotiate.
* **Middle ground:**  $750,000 is halfway between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest offer, signaling his willingness to find a solution.
* **Remaining rounds:** Bob still has 6 rounds to work with, so there's time to refine his strategy if needed.

By increasing his offer slightly, Bob aims to encourage Alice to consider his position and potentially make a counteroffer closer to his target price."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  Even though Alice is moving closer to Bob's desired price, she is still asking for more than Bob is willing to pay at this point.
* **More room for negotiation:** With 5 rounds left, Bob can still try to get a better price.
* **John's offer remains a fallback option.** There's no reason to buy from John yet, as there is still potential to reach a better deal with Alice.

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob signals that he is committed to getting a lower price and encourages Alice to make a more significant concession in the next round."
