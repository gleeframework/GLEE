Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a new price of $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a great price. What do you think?
