"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price that gives you a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $9,000 is a bit higher than my initial target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $8,750? I think that's a fair compromise that still gives me a good deal and allows you to make a decent profit.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,875? This gives you a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $8,875 is still a bit above my target, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we try $8,750 again? I think that's the best we can do without going over my budget.",8750.0,Bob,6,
