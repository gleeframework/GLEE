``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but it also leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for me. I am still open to making a counteroffer if needed, but I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me at a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While his offer is closer to my desired value than his initial rejection, it's still not enough.  I am confident I can get a better price by negotiating further with Bob. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price that gives you a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $9,000 is a bit higher than my initial target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we try $8,750? I think that's a fair compromise that still gives me a good deal and allows you to make a decent profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired value and the price John is offering. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $8,875 is still a bit above my target, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we try $8,750 again? I think that's the best we can do without going over my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has shown a reluctance to move beyond his initial price point. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further stalling or Bob backing out completely is high.  John is offering me a price that meets my minimum requirements, and I'm not confident I can get a better offer from Bob. It's time to secure the guaranteed sale."
