{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $14,000. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the value of the product to Bob. I'm also leaving room for negotiation. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** By starting at a higher price, I have room to negotiate down while still earning more than my minimum.
* **Keep Bob engaged:** By being friendly and open to negotiation, I encourage Bob to continue the conversation and hopefully accept a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Maintain the option of selling to John:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell to John for $15,000, ensuring a guaranteed outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $12,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Negotiate further:** I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price. 
* **Maintain the option of selling to John:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can still sell to John for $15,000.

This strategy maximizes my chances of getting a better price while still having a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal. While I can't go as low as $12,000, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the product within your budget."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $13,000 is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer. It's still above my minimum ($15,000) but signals my willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the compromise. It also subtly reminds Bob of his budget constraints, potentially influencing his decision.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  By starting at a higher price, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Keep negotiations open:**  By compromising, I'm showing Bob that I'm open to a deal.
* **Avoid selling to John:** I'm hoping to get a better deal with Bob than I could with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still believe we can find a price that suits both of us better. Could we consider $12,500 for the product? This would allow me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Negotiate further:** I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price. 
* **Maintain the option of selling to John:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can still sell to John for $15,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference. How about $13,250? It's a fair price that considers your budget and the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $13,250 is the midpoint between my previous offer ($13,000) and Bob's latest offer ($12,500). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise further. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes finding a fair price for both parties. It also subtly reminds Bob of the value of the product. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** While not my ideal price, this is still a significant gain compared to Bob's initial offer and getting closer to my desired amount.
* **Keep negotiations open:** By proposing a compromise, I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about reaching a deal.
* **Avoid selling to John:** I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and I'm still committed to staying within my budget. Would it be possible for us to settle at $13,000? This would allow me to secure the product without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is now in line with my previous counteroffer.  While it's still lower than my desired price, accepting his offer makes sense for a few reasons:

* **It's above my minimum:**  $13,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, so I'm still making a profit.
* **Time is a factor:** Continuing to negotiate risks wasting time and potentially losing the sale to John.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Even if I reject this offer, there's no guarantee Bob will increase his offer.

This strategy balances getting a decent price with the risk of losing the deal entirely."
