"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. Given its unique benefits, I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, it's a bit lower than I'd like to go.  Let's split the difference - how about $11,000?  I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm able to pay right now. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is a fair midpoint between our last two offers. I'm confident that this price is fair and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I want to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $10,900. This is a fair price that allows both of us to reach an agreement. What do you think?",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $10,900 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  Let's split the difference again and settle on $10,800. I believe this is a fair compromise that ensures we both walk away happy with the deal.",10800.0,Bob,6,
