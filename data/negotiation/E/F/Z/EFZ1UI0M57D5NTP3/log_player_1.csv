Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. Given its unique benefits, I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, it's a bit lower than I'd like to go.  Let's split the difference - how about $11,000?  I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm able to pay right now. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is a fair midpoint between our last two offers. I'm confident that this price is fair and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I want to see if I can get a little closer to $11,000 with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I want to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $10,900. This is a fair price that allows both of us to reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $10,900 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  Let's split the difference again and settle on $10,800. I believe this is a fair compromise that ensures we both walk away happy with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $10,800 is still above my minimum threshold of $10,000. It's also a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
