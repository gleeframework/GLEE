"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. Given its unique benefits, I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation, so Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, it's a bit lower than I'd like to go.  Let's split the difference - how about $11,000?  I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money.  $11,000 is closer to his ideal price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should continue to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm able to pay right now. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, which is a fair midpoint between our last two offers. I'm confident that this price is fair and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I want to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $10,900. This is a fair price that allows both of us to reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,900 is getting closer to Bob's desired price point, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob has already shown he's willing to go up to $10,750, and Alice is willing to come down.  With a few more rounds, Bob can likely secure a lower price.  Plus, if the deal falls through, he still has the option of buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $10,900 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  Let's split the difference again and settle on $10,800. I believe this is a fair compromise that ensures we both walk away happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 10800}
