Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $150."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $100, starting with a price higher than that leaves room for negotiation and potential profit beyond my minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $100 provides a safety net. This allows me to confidently aim higher with Bob.
* **First Offer Psychology:**  A strong first offer can anchor the negotiation in my favor. Even if Bob doesn't accept $150 outright, it sets a higher perceived value."
