"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer in its field. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1500000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. I believe the product's value is worth a premium, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to go below $1800000.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1800000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1600000. This represents a significant investment on my end, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1600000 is the best value for this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1700000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1700000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1650000. This is a significant investment for me, and it's the absolute maximum I can offer. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this point.",1650000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1650000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1725000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",1725000.0,Alice,7,
