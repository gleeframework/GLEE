Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You have valuable information â€“ you know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. This allows you to aim for a price higher than your minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While you could start at $1,199,999, a slightly lower offer like $1,050,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate and still feel like he's getting a deal.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. By pricing it at $1,050,000, you're aiming for a significant profit margin while still making the offer attractive enough that Bob might accept outright.

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible strategy.  You could adjust your offer based on factors like:

* **Your risk tolerance:**  Are you willing to risk losing the sale to Bob to potentially earn more?
* **Bob's personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start with a higher price."
