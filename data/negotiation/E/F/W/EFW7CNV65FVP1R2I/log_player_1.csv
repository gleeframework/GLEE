Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high initially to leave room for negotiation and gauge Bob's interest.
* **Above My Minimum:**  The $1,600,000 offer is significantly above my $1,200,000 minimum, ensuring any potential deal is profitable.
* **Gauging Bob's Response:**  His reaction to this initial offer will give me valuable information about his willingness to pay and negotiation strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still a significant profit margin above my $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  His counteroffer suggests he's interested but trying to negotiate a lower price. There's room to meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **John as Backup:**  I still have the option to sell to John for my minimum if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm motivated to find a deal, that price point is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Meeting in the middle at $1,500,000 shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong profit.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help determine how flexible Bob is willing to be on price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm keeping my counteroffer significantly above my minimum price and John's offer, preserving my negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,450,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** While not my ideal price, $1,450,000 is still a very good profit ($250,000 above my minimum).
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental gains.  Bob seems to be firming up his position.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations and allows me to re-invest the earnings sooner."
