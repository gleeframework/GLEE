Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is above what Bob is willing to pay, but it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation, and hopefully, we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to earn at least $150. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go as high as $140, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $140. How about $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my goal.  I've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and I'm not confident I can get Bob to go any higher.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit."
