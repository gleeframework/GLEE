"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in this product but I'm only able to pay $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can work something out.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, however,  $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,800,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still not able to go that high.  How about $1,100,000?  This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable I'll have to go with John's offer.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
