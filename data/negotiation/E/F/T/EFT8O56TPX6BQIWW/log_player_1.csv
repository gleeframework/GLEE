Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done some research and I'm not sure it's worth $9,500 to me. Can we meet in the middle at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I'm still not convinced. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new counteroffer of $8,200. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee he'll budge further. To avoid the risk of further rounds and potential losses, I'll sell the product to John for $8,000. This ensures I meet my minimum profit requirement."
