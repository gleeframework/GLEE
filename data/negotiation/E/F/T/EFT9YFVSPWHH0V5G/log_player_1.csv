"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product for $1,100,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is a bit more than Bob's estimated value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving Room:**  I'm leaving some wiggle room for Bob to counteroffer without me feeling like I'm giving away too much. 

I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum price with subsequent offers.  However, I'm also aware that I have the option to go with John's offer if the negotiations with Bob don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. It's still a significant investment for me, but I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned it has to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,200,000. While it's tempting to take the quick $900,000,  it's not worth sacrificing over $300,000. 

I'm confident I can still get closer to my target price by continuing negotiations with Bob. I have 8 rounds left, which is more than enough time to reach a compromise. 

I'll send a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However,  $900,000 is simply too low. It's crucial to recognize the true value of this product, which is far greater than that.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'm proposing $1,000,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway. This shows my willingness to negotiate while staying firm on the product's value.
* **Highlight Value:** I emphasize the product's real value, reminding Bob that $1,000,000 is still a good deal for him. 
* **Positive Outlook:**  I maintain a positive tone, focusing on a ""mutually beneficial agreement"" to encourage Bob to continue the negotiations. 

I'm strategically aiming for a price that's close to Bob's perceived value, hoping to reach a deal before needing to resort to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my target.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000 at this point. I'm confident that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can reach a deal that's more favorable for me.

I'm committed to trying to get the best possible price, and I believe I can get closer to my goal by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'm not yet ready to settle for a lower price, as I have the option of selling to John for $1,200,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value, which is significantly higher. To find common ground, I'm willing to offer a final compromise at $980,000. It's a fair price that considers both our needs, and I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm signaling that this is my final offer to create urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Reasonable Adjustment:**  I'm offering a small adjustment, moving slightly closer to Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a strong position.
* **Positive Language:** I maintain a positive tone, emphasizing the ""fantastic opportunity"" and ""common ground.""
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the product's true value, subtly reminding Bob of the potential he's missing out on if he rejects my offer.

I believe this counteroffer is a good balance between getting closer to my target price and still leaving room for a potential agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $980000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $960000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $960,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000. We're in the final stages of the negotiation and I'm confident that I can achieve a better price with a few more rounds. 

The fact that I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me the leverage to hold out for a higher price. I'm determined to get as close to my target as possible, and I believe that I can convince Bob to come up with a more reasonable offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for a good price, and I respect that. However, I've already made significant concessions, and $960,000 still falls short of the product's true value. To demonstrate my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm offering one final compromise at $970,000. This price is fair to both of us, and it would allow us to move forward with the transaction. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 970000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm again signaling this is my final offer to create urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a reason for my offer by highlighting the concessions already made and the value of the product.
* **Fairness:** I emphasize that the price is fair to both parties, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Urgency:** I emphasize the need to move forward to encourage Bob to make a decision.

With only three rounds left, I'm getting closer to my minimum price. I'm confident that this final compromise will be attractive enough for Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to pay $970000. I'm starting to think that the product might not be worth that much to me after all. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to see some real movement on your part. I'm thinking $920000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $920,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,200,000. It's getting very close to the end of the negotiation and with only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to get to a price I'm comfortable with.

While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I've already made substantial concessions and Bob is not demonstrating a willingness to meet me halfway.  At this point, it's more advantageous to sell to John for $1,200,000.  This guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of ending up with a price significantly lower than my minimum."
