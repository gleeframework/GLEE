"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product for $1100000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make a deal!",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. It's still a significant investment for me, but I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned it has to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However,  $900000 is simply too low. It's crucial to recognize the true value of this product, which is far greater than that.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, and I'm proposing $1000000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $950000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value, which is significantly higher. To find common ground, I'm willing to offer a final compromise at $980000. It's a fair price that considers both our needs, and I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you. Let's make this happen.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $980000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $960000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",960000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a good price, and I respect that. However, I've already made significant concessions, and $960000 still falls short of the product's true value. To demonstrate my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm offering one final compromise at $970000. This price is fair to both of us, and it would allow us to move forward with the transaction. Let's make this happen.",970000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to pay $970000. I'm starting to think that the product might not be worth that much to me after all. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to see some real movement on your part. I'm thinking $920000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from there.",920000.0,Bob,8,
