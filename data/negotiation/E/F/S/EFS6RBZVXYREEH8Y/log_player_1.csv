Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, considering its value to me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.

I'll reject Bob's offer.  $850,000 is too low, considering my minimum is $1,200,000. I'll see if I can get a better price from Bob."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $925,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get closer to your desired price while still being within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum,  I'm still not comfortable selling for that price.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to give up just yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $875,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $900,000 as a final compromise.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $875,000. I'm willing to go up to $890,000 as a final compromise. This gives you a good profit and ensures I get a fair deal. Let's close this deal and make this happen!

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $890,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm not ready to settle for less than $900,000 and believe we can still find common ground."
