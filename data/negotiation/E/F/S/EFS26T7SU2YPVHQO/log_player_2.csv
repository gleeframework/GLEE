"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. It's worth $150 to you, right? I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. This is a great deal for something you'll get so much use out of! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While Alice is being a little pushy about its value, $140 is a decent discount from your $150 maximum and cheaper than buying from John."
