Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I believe it could be very beneficial for you. I'm asking for $12,000, which reflects the true value and potential of what I'm offering. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Value Justification:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob specifically can make the price more palatable, even if it's above his perceived worth.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The tone is open for discussion, suggesting you might be open to negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to maximize profit while acknowledging Bob's potential interest. If Bob rejects the offer, you can always fall back on your guaranteed sale to John."
