Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible, while staying above my minimum ($100).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $99 creates the perception of a deal. It's a price slightly below my guaranteed sale to John and leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a small discount.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100 provides me leverage in negotiations with Bob."
