"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,200,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a significant investment for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand the value you place on this product, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to still get a good deal while remaining within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
