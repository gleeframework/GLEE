"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe holds significant value. Given its quality and features, it's worth more than $150 to us. However, I understand your perspective and would like to make you an offer. Considering your valuation, I propose selling the product to you for $120. This price reflects a fair compromise between its worth to us and your assessment. I hope this offer aligns with your expectations and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",120.0,Alice,1,
