"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However,  $1100000 is a bit higher than my current budget. I'm willing to offer $950000. This reflects the value I see in the product while still allowing for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1025000. This is still a great value for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1025000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go at this moment.  I'm willing to offer $975000, which is a significant step closer to your last price. It's a fair price that respects the value of the product while allowing me to stay within budget.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $990000. This is a great opportunity for you to get the product at a price that's very close to what I'm looking for.
