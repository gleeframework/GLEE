"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1100000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can potentially save more money by negotiating.  You know the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000.  This means there's room for a compromise.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1025000. This is still a great value for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, but you're still within striking distance of a better deal.  Since you know John is willing to sell for $1,000,000, there's no reason to settle for a price higher than that.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to make another counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to $1,000,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go at this moment.  I'm willing to offer $975,000, which is a significant step closer to your last price. It's a fair price that respects the value of the product while allowing me to stay within budget.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $990000. This is a great opportunity for you to get the product at a price that's very close to what I'm looking for. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $990,000 is just $10,000 higher than what John would sell it for.  This is a good deal considering you're not far off from your desired price and it avoids the risk of further negotiation.  The potential for further negotiation exists, but the chance of securing a price lower than $990,000 is relatively low.  Therefore, accepting the offer is the most logical choice."
