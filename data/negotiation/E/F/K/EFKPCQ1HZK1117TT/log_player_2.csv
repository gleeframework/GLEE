"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. You'll get a valuable product for a price lower than its worth to you, and I'll get a good return on my investment. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to Bob, it's still more expensive than buying from John.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best strategy to minimize cost."
