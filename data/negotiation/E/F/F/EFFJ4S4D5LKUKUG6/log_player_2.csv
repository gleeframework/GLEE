Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that high.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price.  $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $9,500? That's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
