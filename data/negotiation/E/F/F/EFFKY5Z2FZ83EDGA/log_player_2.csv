Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $8,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $8,500. It's better to secure the product from John at $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
