"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit below your minimum value for the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point of $800,000.  You can likely get a better deal if you continue negotiating."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle, at $900,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my budget. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your target, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can offer it to you for $925,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's a fair compromise given the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  At this point, you've negotiated as much as you can, and it's better to secure the product from John at your target price.  While you would save $75,000 if you could get the product from Alice, the risk of further negotiations dragging on and potentially going over your budget isn't worth it."
