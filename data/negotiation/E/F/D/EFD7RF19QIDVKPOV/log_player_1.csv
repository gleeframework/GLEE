Send your offer to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I can only pay up to $100 for the product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than nothing, I'm hoping I can get closer to my minimum price of $150.  I'll see if I can get him to move a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'd like to stick to my budget. Would $110 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll see if I can negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $110 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  Let's try $115.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to be flexible to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility. I think $112 would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my minimum desired price, I'm running out of rounds and it's not much lower than what I'm willing to accept. It's better to secure a sale now than risk getting nothing if I keep rejecting offers."
