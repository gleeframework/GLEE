"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product,  $13,500 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a great deal for you, and it's still within my price range.  Let's make this happen!",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? I'm confident this is a fair price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
