"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is less than Bob's maximum budget, it's still a good deal for Alice. Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product,  $13,500 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a lower price, but still offering a price that is higher than what the product is worth to Alice.  This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about purchasing the product but also that he's trying to find a price that is fair for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a great deal for you, and it's still within my price range.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $12,500 is still a bit high. There's room for more negotiation, and Bob is better off continuing to push for a lower price rather than accepting Alice's offer or giving up and buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? I'm confident this is a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of getting the best possible price. He's proposing a middle ground that's still favorable to him, but also shows a willingness to compromise. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's commitment to negotiating while staying within his budget."
