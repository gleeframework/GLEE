Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I believe it's a fair price considering its value."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

I'm starting the negotiation at a price slightly below Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I know he values the product at $120. I'll try to negotiate a better price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your budget concerns, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $108? That's a significant discount from my initial offer."", 
""product_price"": 108
}
```

I'm aiming to maintain a price point well above my minimum while acknowledging Bob's attempt to negotiate. By suggesting a compromise, I'm hoping to entice him towards a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, would it be possible to lower the price to $100? That's my maximum I'm willing to spend. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is firm on his $100 offer, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome. Accepting his offer ensures a profit and avoids the risk of losing both buyers."
