"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to make this happen.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $9,500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and offer the product for $10,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in that. Let's close this deal!",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $9,750, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,250. This is a compromise for both of us, and it's getting closer to a deal we can both agree on.  What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to meet you at $9,900, but that's as high as I can go. Can we make it work at that price?",9900.0,Bob,8,
