"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. To kick things off, I'd like to propose a starting price of $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your position, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $875,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver substantial value.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $875,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $825,000. This is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
