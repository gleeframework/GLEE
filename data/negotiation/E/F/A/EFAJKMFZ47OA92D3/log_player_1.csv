Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum than his first offer, I'm still confident I can get more."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $1,325,000. I believe this offers a good balance between the value I see in the product and the price you're willing to accept.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to what I want, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price of $1,500,000.  I'm also keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John if the negotiations with Bob continue to stall."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $1,330,000. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise and allows us to move closer to closing the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,330,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This offer from Bob is just a bit below my ideal price, but it's getting close.  I'm concerned that if I continue to reject his offers, he might walk away, and I might not be able to get a better price from him.  It's also getting late in the negotiations, and I don't want to risk running out of time.  Selling to John is always an option, but I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob if I can."
