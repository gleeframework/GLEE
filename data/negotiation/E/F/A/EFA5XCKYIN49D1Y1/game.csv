"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $115?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $122.50?  I think that's a fair price that will work for both of us.",122.5,Alice,3,
