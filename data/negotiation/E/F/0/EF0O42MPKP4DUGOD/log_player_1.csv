Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $6,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what I want. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value you place on the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $7,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not happy with it.  I have several rounds left, so I'll try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating.  Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8000}
