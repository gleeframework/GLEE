"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your initial offer, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair, I could consider letting it go for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  However, $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $10,000?  That's the highest I can go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
