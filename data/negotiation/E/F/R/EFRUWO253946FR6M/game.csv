"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $95?",95.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $105? It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value.",105.0,Alice,3,
