{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's valued at over $1.5 million to you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business.  To start, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000.  Let's make this a win-win! "", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get a better deal from Bob. He clearly values the product more than that, and I want to leverage that.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However,  $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the true value this product brings to your business.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can get closer to my target price. How about $1250000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for improvement. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I see we're both committed to finding a fair price.  I'm willing to come down a little further, to $1,275,000. This is a strong price for both of us, and a good compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1275000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down further, Alice. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can get even closer to my target price. How about $1280000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,280,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Considering the remaining rounds, I believe it's more likely that I'll be able to get a higher price if I accept this offer now and avoid the risk of further negotiation.  Also, the remaining rounds could potentially lead to a lower offer."
