Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175.  This is above Bob's perceived value of $100, but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get close to my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm rejecting it and will counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price to $140.  This is still above Bob's offer, but closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will be a reasonable compromise for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counter with a final attempt to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm lowering my price one last time to $130.  This is a significant compromise from my initial price, but still allows me to make a profit while potentially reaching an agreement with Bob."
