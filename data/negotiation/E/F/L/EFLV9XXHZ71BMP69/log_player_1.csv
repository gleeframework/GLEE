Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business.  Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible without going under, as John guarantees $1,200,000.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision quickly.

This approach aims to strike a balance between getting the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale and avoiding the risk of him rejecting the offer."
