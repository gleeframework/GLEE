"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get a better deal than $1,000,000.  Alice values the product at $800,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  Considering your value for the product, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is a better price than her initial offer of $1,000,000 and your counteroffer of $900,000. You're still saving $250,000 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially increasing her price again exists. It's a good deal and a reasonable compromise."
