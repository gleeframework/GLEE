"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can get closer to $1,000,000 by continuing to negotiate.  I have 8 rounds left, and I'm not in a rush to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 isn't quite where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,050,000?  This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives us both room to be happy.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900,000. How about we meet at $950,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  John is a reliable backup option, but I still have 6 rounds to go, and I'm confident I can secure a price closer to $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see your willingness to compromise. I'm prepared to come down a little further, but I can't go below $1,000,000. This price still reflects the product's true value.  Let's close this deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'm disappointed I couldn't close the deal with Bob at my ideal price, $980,000 is still a good return, but the risk of Bob continuing to stall and not reaching my desired price is too high. I'm only left with 4 rounds, and I can't afford to lose more time."
