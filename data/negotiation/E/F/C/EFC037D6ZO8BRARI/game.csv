"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 isn't quite where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,050,000?  This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives us both room to be happy.  Let me know what you think!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to see your willingness to compromise. I'm prepared to come down a little further, but I can't go below $1,000,000. This price still reflects the product's true value.  Let's close this deal, what do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
