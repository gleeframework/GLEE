Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position, allowing her to be more confident in her offer to Bob."
