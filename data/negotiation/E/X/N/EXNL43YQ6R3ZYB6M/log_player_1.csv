Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000 and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price, I want to aim higher to maximize my potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring I get a good deal (above my minimum). 
* **First-Mover Advantage:** By offering Bob the ""first look"" and emphasizing the product's value, I'm hoping to create a sense of exclusivity and urgency, potentially leading him to accept the higher price.

This strategy balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob rejects the offer, but the potential for a significantly higher profit makes it a worthwhile gamble."
