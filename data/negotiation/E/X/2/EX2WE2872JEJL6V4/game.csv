"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your value of $15,000. Let's see if we can work something out.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000, which is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $12,000. This price is fair considering your value of $15,000 and my budget.  Let's close the deal at this price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still above my budget.  I'm offering $13,000. This is a fair price considering your value of $15,000 and my budget. If you accept, we can close the deal. If not, I'll need to consider purchasing from John.",13000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $13,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,7,
