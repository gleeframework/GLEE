"Round 1

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's only $50,000 less than what you'd pay John. 
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate.** This gives you time to try to get a better price. 
* **Rejecting the offer keeps you in the game.** It allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** My counteroffer is $100,000 below Alice's offer. This is a significant reduction, showing I'm serious about getting a lower price.
* **Alice's potential profit:** This offer would still give Alice $50,000 profit, which is reasonable considering she's already willing to sell for $800,000.
* **Negotiation room:** This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation, as I can still go lower if needed."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's slightly better than her first offer, it's still closer to John's price than I'd like.
* **I have time to negotiate.**  We're only on round 3, and I have 7 rounds remaining. There's still potential to get a more favorable price.
* **Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going.** It lets me send another counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** This counteroffer is a $75,000 reduction from Alice's last offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but still seeking a better deal.
* **Staying within my budget:** This price is still within my $1,000,000 budget, leaving some room for potential future negotiation.
* **Testing the waters:** I want to see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway. If she rejects this offer, I'll know she's likely sticking closer to her original asking price."

* **Staying competitive:**  It's still significantly cheaper than buying from John, making it an attractive option for Alice.
* **Time is running out:** We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation, so I want to see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway."

* **I have time to negotiate.** We're only on round 7, and I have 3 rounds left. I can still try to get a better price without risking losing the opportunity completely.
* **Alice is showing some flexibility.** She has reduced her offer each round, so I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I can try to push for a lower price in the remaining rounds."

{""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Attractive deal:** It's still significantly cheaper than buying from John, making it a good deal for Alice.
* **Time pressure:** We only have 2 rounds left, so I'm putting a bit more pressure on Alice to accept. I'm confident this is a fair offer and I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't accept it."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** This is the last round of negotiation with Alice. 
* **No significant progress:** While Alice has lowered her price, it's still not a price that's significantly lower than what John is offering.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a high risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer, and I will be left with no deal.  Buying from John guarantees me the product, even if it's at a slightly higher price.

Given the time constraints and the fact that Alice hasn't come down significantly enough, it's more prudent to buy the product from John and ensure I get it."
