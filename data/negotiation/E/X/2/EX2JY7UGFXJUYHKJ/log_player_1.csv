Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. $600,000 is too far below my minimum."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $725000? I think that's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:

``` 

While $725,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  John's offer of $800,000 is a guaranteed sale and closer to my desired value.  I'm going to sell to John."
