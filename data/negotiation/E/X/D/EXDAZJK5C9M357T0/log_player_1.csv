Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $15,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum but gives room for negotiation.
* **Building Interest:** The message is friendly and suggests the product is valuable, potentially piquing Bob's interest.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By starting high, I allow for potential counteroffers from Bob while still leaving space for a profitable sale.
* **The John Option:**  The presence of John as a backup buyer gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the uniqueness of your product, $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $11000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $11,000 is better than my absolute minimum of $10,000, it's still significantly lower than the value I place on the product. 
* **Negotiation Room:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially close the gap.
* **John is an Option:**  While John represents a guaranteed $10,000, I'm willing to gamble on potentially getting closer to my desired price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of this product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message keeps the door open for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $13000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $12500, which is right in my budget.  This is my final offer, so please let me know if it works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $12,500 is only $500 away from my minimum desired price. 
* **Final Offer:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, meaning further negotiation may be futile.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing negotiations risks further price decreases and potentially losing Bob as a buyer altogether. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Even though I'm accepting Bob's offer, John's offer of $10,000 is still there as a backup if the deal with Bob falls through.  

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer at this stage is the most logical choice.  It's close to my minimum target, and the risk of further negotiation potentially resulting in a lower price isn't worth taking."
