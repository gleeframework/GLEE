"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $14,000. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $10,000, which would align better with what I am willing to pay?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my position, Alice. While I appreciate the adjustment to $12,000, I still believe we might be able to find a middle ground. Could you possibly lower the price to $11,000? This would be more in line with my budget while still allowing me to acquire the product.",11000.0,Bob,4,
