"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $12,500 is better than nothing, it's still a significant loss for me. I'll try to get closer to my desired price range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,500. This is still a great price for a product worth $12,000 to you. Let's find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
