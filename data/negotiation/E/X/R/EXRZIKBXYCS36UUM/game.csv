"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I can do $1,025,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is already a compromise from my initial price, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
