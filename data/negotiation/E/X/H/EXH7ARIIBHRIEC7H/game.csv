"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm starting the negotiation at $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects the true value you'll gain from it.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential value of the product, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth to me. What do you think?",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing your perspective.  While $1,700,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $2,000,000 even? This reflects my desire to make a deal while still respecting the value of this product.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm ready to pay $1,800,000.  This is a substantial offer considering my budget, and I hope we can find common ground at this price.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're getting closer. To show you I'm serious about making this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000.  This shows my commitment to reaching a deal, but it's the absolute maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can close this gap.",1850000.0,Bob,6,
