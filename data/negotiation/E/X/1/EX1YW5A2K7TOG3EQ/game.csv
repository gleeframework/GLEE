"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1600000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $1550000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1550000.

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm afraid I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1500000, and that's my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1500000.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
