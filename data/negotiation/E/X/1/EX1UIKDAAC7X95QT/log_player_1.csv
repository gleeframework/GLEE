{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer gives me a significant profit while still being potentially attractive to Bob, as it's lower than the value he places on the product. This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for a higher sale price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering the value of the product to me, I am willing to pay up to $1350000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,400,000.  Let's compromise at $1,375,000. This price is still beneficial for both of us and allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but based on my assessment, I believe $1360000 would be a fair price for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price, and it would be foolish to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  A sale for $1,360,000 is still a significant profit and is a good outcome considering the risk of a counteroffer being rejected."
