{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for a product that's worth $15,000 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  $14,000 is well above your $12,000 minimum, so you're already in a good position.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob might be willing to pay more, and you can adjust your price based on his response. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** By offering a price that's lower than the product's perceived value to Bob, you increase the chances of him accepting. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little steep for me. How about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, it's far below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $13,000 for this product.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:**  You're willing to negotiate, but you're not budging too far from your desired price point.
* **Remains above your minimum:**  $13,000 still meets your minimum goal.
* **Sets the stage for continued discussion:**  By offering a compromise, you're encouraging Bob to counter with a price that's closer to your desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $11,500?  That's a significant jump from my last offer and meets us closer to the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still not quite there.  You can likely do better by continuing the negotiation. Rejecting his offer will allow you to try and push for a price closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, $11,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about $12,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Recognizes Bob's effort:** Acknowledging his move towards your desired price point shows you're taking his position seriously.
* **Offers a compromise:** $12,500 is a middle ground between his last offer and your minimum.
* **Highlights the value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's worth to him might motivate him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a great deal for you!  Bob's offer of $12,000 meets your minimum acceptable price.  There's no reason to continue negotiating, especially since John is willing to buy the product for the same price.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures you get your desired price and avoids any potential complications with John."
