"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for a product that's worth $15,000 to you! Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little steep for me. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $13,000 for this product.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $11,500?  That's a significant jump from my last offer and meets us closer to the middle.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, $11,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about $12,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and settle at $12,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
