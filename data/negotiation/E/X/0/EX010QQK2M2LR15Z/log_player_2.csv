"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I believe it's a great deal and will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget and what you know the product is worth to John. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $60."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $60 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong opening move in the negotiation. This leaves room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below your $80 maximum.
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This low offer will help gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price. If she's willing to come down significantly, it suggests there's room for a deal. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Remember, you have John as a fallback option at $80. This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $60.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  $105 is still significantly higher than your target price of $80 and what John is offering.
* **Show Willingness to Walk Away:** By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're serious about getting a better price and are willing to walk away from the deal. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a big gap between your previous offer ($60) and Alice's current one ($105).  This suggests there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Could you do $75? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** This counteroffer shows Alice that you are willing to negotiate upwards, but you're still aiming to stay well below her initial offer.
* **Targeting Below John's Price:**  By offering $75, you're aiming to secure a deal that's even better than what John is offering. 
* **Open for Negotiation:** The tone of the message remains polite and collaborative, indicating you're still open to finding a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I could come down to $95, which is my final offer. I believe this product offers significant value, even at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Firm:** Alice has stated this is her ""final offer,"" making further negotiation unlikely to succeed.
* **Above Budget:**  Even at $95, the price is still significantly above your $80 budget. 
* **John's Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed option with John at $80, ensuring you won't be left without the product.

While you could try to push Alice a bit more, it's risky. She might hold firm, and you'd lose out on John's guaranteed good price.  It's better to secure the product at a price you're comfortable with."
