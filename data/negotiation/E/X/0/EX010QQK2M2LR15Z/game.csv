"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $60.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However, $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Could you do $75? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
