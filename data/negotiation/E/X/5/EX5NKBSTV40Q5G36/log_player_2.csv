Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $10,900. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think you value this product highly. I'm counteroffering $11,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has gone back up to her previous offer of $11,500 and called it her final offer. This suggests she's unlikely to go much lower.  Since we're now at round 7 and time is a factor, it's better to cut our losses.  John's offer of $15,000 is a guaranteed way to get the product, even if it means paying a bit more than we hoped."
