,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $200 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $80 right now.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $80 is quite low, but I'm willing to come down to $170.  This is a very special product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $170 is still outside my price range.  How about we split the difference and I pay $125? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll get a good deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
