Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting, it's becoming clear that bridging the gap between his price ceiling and my desired outcome is unlikely.  He's incrementally increasing his offers, but I'm not confident he'll reach $1,500,000. Accepting John's offer ensures I get the minimum acceptable price for the product without further risk or time spent negotiating."
