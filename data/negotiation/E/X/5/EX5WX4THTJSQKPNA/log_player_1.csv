Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to your maximum potential profit.
* **Attractive but Realistic:**  While $80 is Bob's perceived value, a price significantly lower than $140 might seem too good to be true or raise suspicions.  

This strategy aims to find a balance between enticing Bob and ensuring you get the best possible price for your product."
