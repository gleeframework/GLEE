"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20000 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in your product but I'm only willing to pay $10000 at this point. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $17000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $17000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair offer for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13000 is still too low for me, but I'm open to finding a middle ground. Let's try $15500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $15500 is still a bit too high for me. However, I'm eager to finalize this deal. I'm willing to go up to $14000. This would be a fair compromise and allow us to close this deal. Let me know your thoughts.",14000.0,Bob,6,
