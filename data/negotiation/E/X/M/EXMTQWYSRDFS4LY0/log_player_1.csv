Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find very valuable. It's worth $100 to you, but I'm willing to make a deal. How about $120?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always a good idea to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering it at $120, we can see how interested Bob really is. If he accepts, we get more than our minimum. If he rejects, we can always fall back on John's offer.
* **Justification:** While not included in the message above (to avoid anchoring too low), you could subtly justify the price by highlighting the product's value or any unique benefits it offers.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to potentially negotiate with Bob if he counters your initial price."
