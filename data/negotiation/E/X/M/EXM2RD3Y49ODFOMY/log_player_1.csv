Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to let it go for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  $125 is a reasonable starting point, allowing for potential compromises and still giving me a profit.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly approach can help maintain a positive negotiation environment.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've successfully sold the product for a profit.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or counter back, keeping John's $150 offer as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($150).**  While $115 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that much less.
* **I want to see if I can get a higher price.**  I'm confident that Bob is interested in the product, so I'm going to try and negotiate a bit more. 
* **John's offer is my safety net.** I know I can sell to John for $150, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer just because it's on the table. 

**Next Step:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $115 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $120?  That would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and Justification:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and showing willingness to compromise.  Offering a price halfway between his offer and my previous one creates a sense of fairness.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm highlighting that the price I'm proposing is fair for both of us. 
* **Maintain a Friendly Tone:**  I want to keep the negotiation positive and avoid any hostility that might lead to a breakdown.

**Next Steps:** 

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've successfully negotiated a price that's profitable for me.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll need to decide whether to accept his final counteroffer (if he makes one) or sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle and sell it to me for $117.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** $117.50 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **I'm not willing to risk further negotiation.**  While Bob might be willing to go slightly higher, I don't want to risk him backing out entirely or dragging out the negotiation process further.
* **John's offer guarantees me a profit.**  Selling to John for $150 is the most secure and profitable option at this point. 

**I'm choosing to take the guaranteed profit from John, as it's the best option available to me.**"
