"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice first. $140 is a bit too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $140 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

We're starting with a price well below Alice's valuation but still leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to give us a good starting point while gauging Alice's willingness to bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $130, which is the lowest I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're not quite there yet. Let's see if we can nudge her a little closer to our desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $120? That's a fair price for both of us, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

We're now offering Alice her exact valuation of the product. This is a strong negotiating position, as it's unlikely she'll find another buyer willing to pay more. At the same time, it keeps us comfortably below our maximum budget."
