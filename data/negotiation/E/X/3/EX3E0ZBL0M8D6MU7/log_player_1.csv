{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, but it's still too far from my minimum price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to demonstrate that I'm also firm on a reasonable valuation.  I'll use the next counteroffer to  try and steer him closer to $850,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued interest and understanding.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $875,000.  I believe this is a fair and final offer that reflects the true value of this product."", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Time Pressure:** With only a few rounds remaining, I'm applying a bit more pressure by presenting this as a ""fair and final"" offer. This might incentivize Bob to be more aggressive with his next offer. 
* **Strategic Concession:**  By coming down slightly, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm above $850,000, which seems to be a psychological barrier for Bob. 
* **Alternative Option:** I still have the option to walk away and sell to John. This knowledge gives me leverage in the negotiation."
