Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, we're still quite far apart.  To be frank, anything under $900,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to hold firm at that price, as it represents a significant reduction from my initial ask.

Explanation: While Alice is coming down in price, she's unlikely to reach our target price before we run out of rounds. It's now more advantageous to take the guaranteed deal from John at $800,000."
