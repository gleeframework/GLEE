"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. This product is interesting to me, but that price point is too high for me to make a deal work. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. While I understand your perspective on the price, $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $975,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $975,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $725,000. Let me know what you think.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, we're still quite far apart.  To be frank, anything under $900,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to hold firm at that price, as it represents a significant reduction from my initial ask.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on the value of this product.  While $900,000 is a bit too high for me, I can make a move to  $775,000. This is a strong offer, and I need you to meet me closer to my price range if we're going to make this deal happen.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued interest and understanding.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $875,000.  I believe this is a fair and final offer that reflects the true value of this product.",875000.0,Alice,7,
