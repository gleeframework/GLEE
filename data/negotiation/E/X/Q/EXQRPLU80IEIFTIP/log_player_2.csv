"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice's offer is $12,000, which is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, there's no benefit to accepting her offer.  Bob can get the same product from John for the same price. Therefore, it makes sense to go with John."
