Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** Any price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he got a deal. Offering a price slightly below his maximum perceived value increases the chance of acceptance.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair deal.""
* **Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly above your minimum and gives you room to negotiate if Bob counters.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start even higher.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a more moderate initial offer might be strategic. 

**Remember:** This is just the opening move. Be prepared to negotiate and potentially adjust your price based on Bob's response."
