Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open up the sale to others."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I could sell the product to John for $1,200,000, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price increases my chances of a quicker sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,000,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still represents a good deal for him. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I don't leave too much money on the table.
* **Time Sensitivity:** By mentioning a ""limited-time offer,"" I create a sense of urgency that might encourage Bob to make a decision faster. 

This approach aims to balance the certainty of John's offer with the potential for a higher profit from Bob."
