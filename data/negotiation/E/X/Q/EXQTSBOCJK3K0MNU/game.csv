"Hi Alice, thanks for reaching out. While I agree the product is valuable, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. Considering its value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you'll get from the product, and I think it's a good compromise. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. To be honest, my budget caps out at $11,000. If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $11,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering it to you for $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a good value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12500.0,Alice,5,
