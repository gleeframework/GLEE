"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $13,000? That's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go up to $13,000. How about $11,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway.",11800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway on my previous offer.  Let's go with $12,500. This is a very fair price for the value this product brings to your business.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $12,200, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",12200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $12,200.  I'm just a bit hesitant to go that low. How about $12,300? It's a small difference, but it would be a good middle ground for both of us. Let me know what you think.",12300.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $12,300. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000, and that's my final offer. I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at that price.",12000.0,Bob,8,
