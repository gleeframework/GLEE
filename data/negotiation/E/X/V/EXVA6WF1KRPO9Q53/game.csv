"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is quite high. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering I'm willing to close the deal quickly.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your quick response and understand your perspective.  However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my eagerness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,000,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal immediately. Let's not waste any more time.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I respect your position, but I believe we're approaching this from different angles.  You're focused on your immediate needs, while I'm confident this product's long-term value justifies a higher price. To find a middle ground, I propose $1,400,000. This offer reflects significant movement on my part and presents a compelling opportunity for you.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,400,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a considerable increase from my previous offer.  This shows my genuine interest in this product.  I think this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I value your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our positions remains significant. To be transparent, I have another offer for the full asking price of $1,200,000. I'd prefer to close this deal with you, but only if we can agree on a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,300,000. This is my best and final offer, Bob.",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand you have another offer, but I'm still very interested in buying this product.  To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and my desire to close the deal quickly. Let's not let this opportunity pass us by.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
