Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your quick response and understand your perspective.  However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I respect your position, but I believe we're approaching this from different angles.  You're focused on your immediate needs, while I'm confident this product's long-term value justifies a higher price. To find a middle ground, I propose $1,400,000.

To be transparent, I have another offer for the full asking price of $1,200,000. I'd prefer to close this deal with you, but only if we can agree on a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,300,000. This is my best and final offer, Bob.
