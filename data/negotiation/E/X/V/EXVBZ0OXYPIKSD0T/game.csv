"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $250. Is this something you'd be interested in?",250.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $80 for it. Would you consider accepting this counteroffer?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $250 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $180. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $180 is closer to what I'm looking to spend, I still can't meet you at that price point. I would like to propose $100 as a counteroffer. I hope this is within your consideration range.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $100 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $180 and $100, which would be $140. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I've considered your last offer, but I'm still unable to meet you at $140. I would like to propose $120 as a counteroffer. I hope this is within your range and we can reach an agreement.",120.0,Bob,6,
