"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential for future growth.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $775,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the market value of the product. Can you consider this offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and its potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'll meet you at $810,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. This is my final offer. If you can't accept this, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800,000.",810000.0,Bob,6,
