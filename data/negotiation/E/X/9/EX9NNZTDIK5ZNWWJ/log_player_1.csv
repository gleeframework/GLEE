"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a decent starting point, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm aiming to maximize my profit while still being within a reasonable range for Bob to potentially accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is better than my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I want to see if I can get Bob to increase his offer a bit more before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $90. It's a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer.  Hopefully, this will get us closer to a deal while still ensuring I make a decent profit."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

Bob's offer is now at my minimum price of $80. Accepting this offer ensures I reach my minimum profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
