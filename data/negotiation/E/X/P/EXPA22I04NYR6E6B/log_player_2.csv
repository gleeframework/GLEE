"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still being a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice is still asking for too much. You can get the product for $10,000 from John. You want to try to negotiate a better price with Alice but aren't willing to go much higher than your counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair price considering my initial offer and the value you've placed on the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
