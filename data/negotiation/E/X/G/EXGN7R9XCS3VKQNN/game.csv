"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,175,000 is closer, but still a little high for my budget.  How about we settle at $1,075,000?  I feel this is a fair price and I am eager to close this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
