"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and gives me a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $850,000 isn't quite enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $925,000?  This would still give you a significant gain and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $925,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $900,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
