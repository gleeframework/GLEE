"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $8,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $12,000, which is $4,000 more than what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject her offer and look for a better deal.
