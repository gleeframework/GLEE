"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** Even though you're willing to pay up to $120, Alice's offer of $110 saves you $10. 
* **You don't want to risk losing the product.** Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll have to buy from John, which is more expensive."
