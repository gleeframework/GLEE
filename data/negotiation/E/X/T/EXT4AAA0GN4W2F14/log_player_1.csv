Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,150,000 is higher than your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** It leaves room for negotiation, as Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000.
* **It's a significant amount:** It shows you're serious about selling the product, but not desperate. 

This approach allows for a potential back-and-forth with Bob and might lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Remember, you can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget and the value I place on the product, I am willing to offer $1075000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than what you'd like to receive.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired range."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but based on my financial situation, I can't go above $1080000 for this product. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

While $1,080,000 is closer to your goal than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than what you'd like.  There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if you can push Bob a bit higher."
