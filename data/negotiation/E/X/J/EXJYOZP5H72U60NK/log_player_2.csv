# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $12,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for $18,000. It's a much better deal to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $16,000 is a better deal than $18,000, it's still higher than your target price. You have the option to buy from John for $12,000, and it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $16,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has come down in price, $15,500 is still above your maximum budget of $12,000. You have the option to buy from John for a lower price, and it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $15,500 is still out of reach.  My final offer is $13,000.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to go with another seller."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're getting close to your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,250. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice has dropped her price but it's still higher than your budget. You have 3 rounds left but it is unlikely Alice will drop to your desired price. Buying from John is the best option at this point."
