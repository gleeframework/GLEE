""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product at a discounted price of $14,000. I believe it will be very valuable to you, and this is a limited-time offer."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, selling to Bob for more than $15,000 is unlikely.  Our goal is to get the highest price Bob is willing to pay.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with an offer slightly below John's price ($14,000) creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  There's room for Bob to negotiate upwards towards his maximum value of $8,000. This strategy allows for capturing some of the value difference between Bob and John's valuations. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Information Asymmetry:** We don't know if Bob will try to negotiate or walk away. This offer balances risk and reward.
* **Alternative Buyers:** The presence of John provides a safety net, allowing us to be firm on a price that's significantly above our minimum."
