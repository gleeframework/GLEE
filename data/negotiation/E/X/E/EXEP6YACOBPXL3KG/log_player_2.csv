"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than $12,000, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his $8,000 budget as possible. Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for some negotiation while still being significantly lower than Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. Rejecting the offer again allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to pay up to $8,000, but he understands that he needs to meet Alice halfway. Offering $9,000 is a compromise, showing that he's serious about buying the product but still trying to stay within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has shown she's unwilling to go lower than $9,200.  While this is a better price than her initial offer, it's still outside Bob's comfort zone. Buying from John guarantees Bob the product for his maximum price and avoids further negotiation."
