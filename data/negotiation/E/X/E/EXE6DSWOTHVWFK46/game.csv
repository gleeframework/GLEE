"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm hoping to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This would still be a great deal for you, as the product is worth much more to you, and it allows me to get a fair price. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",900000.0,Alice,3,
