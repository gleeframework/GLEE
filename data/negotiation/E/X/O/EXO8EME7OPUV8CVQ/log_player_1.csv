Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  This strategy allows for a potential profit of $40, but also keeps the negotiation open to potentially earn more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below the ideal price. There's a good chance we can get closer to the $120 we initially offered."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This counteroffer splits the difference between our previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, while still aiming for a better price than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $95 isn't our ideal price, it's still better than selling to John.  The negotiation is likely to continue going down from here, and there's a risk of Bob walking away completely. Accepting his offer locks in a profit and avoids that risk."
