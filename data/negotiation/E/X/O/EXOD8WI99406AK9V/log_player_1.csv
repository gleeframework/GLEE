"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's something you'd really value, and I believe it's worth $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to the middle ground between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and enthusiastic to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of his potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. He's shown interest, and I can potentially push for a higher price.
* **No Immediate Need:** I'm not desperate to sell right away. I have 10 rounds, and I want to maximize my profits. Selling to John for $8,000 would be a loss compared to what I believe I can get from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's a great deal for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my desired price point, but still leaves room for further negotiation.

* **Positive and Enthusiastic Tone:** I maintain a friendly tone to keep the negotiation positive and encourage Bob to consider my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. Can we try $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** While Bob's offer of $9,750 is higher than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm not willing to settle for a loss.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I'm confident that I can still push for a higher price with Bob. He has shown a willingness to compromise, and I have a few more rounds to reach a mutually acceptable deal.
* **Avoid Loss:** Selling to John for $8,000 would mean accepting a loss compared to what I believe I can get from Bob."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I value your willingness to compromise, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to come down slightly further, but let's aim for $10,000. This price is still fair for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

* **Limited Rounds Left:** We're halfway through the negotiation rounds, so time is becoming a factor. However, I still believe there's room for improvement with Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, and I understand you're reaching your limit. While $9,800 is still a bit too low for me, I'm willing to make one final concession to reach an agreement.  I'll accept $9,900, which is a good compromise for both of us. This price allows me to cover my costs and lets you acquire a product you'll value highly. Let me know if this works for you!"", ""product_price"": 9900}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Concession:**  I'm making a small, final concession to show my commitment to reaching a deal. $9,900 is still above my minimum, but it demonstrates flexibility.

* **Positive Tone:** I remain friendly and encouraging to keep the negotiation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,900 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,700, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,700.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,700

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time Running Out:** With only 2 rounds left, the negotiation window is closing. 
* **No Significant Increase:** Bob's offer of $9,700 is only a small increase from his previous offer, and it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Risk of No Deal:** There's a high risk that we won't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds. 
* **Minimizing Loss:** Selling to John for $8,000 is a better option than risking no deal and getting nothing. While it's not ideal, it's the most sensible option at this point."
