"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8500. It's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8000, but I need you to come down further from that. How about $7500 again, or even lower?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer the product to you for $7500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it will allow you to get the product you want while still allowing me to make a decent profit.",7500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7000 for the product, and that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll still make a profit.",7000.0,Bob,6,
