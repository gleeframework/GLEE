"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $8,000.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. It's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8000, but I need you to come down further from that. How about $7500 again, or even lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,000 is getting closer to my floor price of $8,000, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll counter his offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer the product to you for $7,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it will allow you to get the product you want while still allowing me to make a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7000 for the product, and that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll still make a profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This negotiation has been going on for a while, and I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere. I'm getting nervous that we're running out of rounds and that Bob may not be serious about buying the product at my desired price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. It's not the highest price I've hoped for, but it's a sure thing, and it's better than risking getting stuck with the product."
