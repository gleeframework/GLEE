Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  Since John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, Alice needs to aim for a price higher than that to make selling to Bob worthwhile.
* **Understand Bob's valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering it at or below this price is leaving money on the table.
* **Negotiation room:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit. This price gives Bob a chance to counter-offer while keeping the deal potentially more attractive to Alice than John's guaranteed purchase. 

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, Alice maximizes her chances of either getting a great deal from Bob or sticking with her guaranteed sale to John."
