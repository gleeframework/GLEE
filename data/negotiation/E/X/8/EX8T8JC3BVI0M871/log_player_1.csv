Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal"" if he counters. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's worth to me (Alice), the message implies a high value by mentioning listing it publicly. This suggests it could be worth even more than Bob's perceived value of $8,000.
* **Gauge Interest:**  This offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he flat out rejects it, I (Alice) haven't lost anything and can proceed with John. If he counters, it means he's seriously considering it."
