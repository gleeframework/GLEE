Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product is truly exceptional. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is significantly below its worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This is my final offer."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget constraints remain. I am unable to accept $1,700,000. My latest counteroffer is $1,600,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""

``` 

While we could continue negotiating, accepting $1,600,000 is a significant profit. It's unlikely Bob will go much higher, and there's always a risk he walks away entirely."
