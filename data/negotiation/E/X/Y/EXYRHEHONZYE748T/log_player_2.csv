# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. $11,500 is still too high for Bob. He wants to save as much money as possible. By rejecting, Bob can start a negotiation to lower the price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,200. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal.

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's getting closer to Bob's ideal price, he can still try to negotiate further.  It's likely that Alice is also willing to compromise a bit more to close the deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you've made concessions, and I appreciate that.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,200.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,100?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 11100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $11,100. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,150. This is the last compromise I'm willing to make. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he was hoping for a lower price, $11,150 is a good deal considering the product's value to him and his willingness to pay up to $12,000.  It's likely that continuing to negotiate will only prolong the process and potentially lead to him having to pay the full $12,000 from John."
