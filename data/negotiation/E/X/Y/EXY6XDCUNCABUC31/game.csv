"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counteroffer $10250. Can you consider this offer?",10250.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $11000. This is my final offer, so I hope you can consider it.",11000.0,Alice,5,
