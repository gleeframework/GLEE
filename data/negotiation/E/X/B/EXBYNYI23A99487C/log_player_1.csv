Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate the value you attribute to it, but I am looking to keep the investment within my budget. My counteroffer is $1,200,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise between the product's worth and my financial capacity. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum threshold.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  If not, I'll sell to John."
