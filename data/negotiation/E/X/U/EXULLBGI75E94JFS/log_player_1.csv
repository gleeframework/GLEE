{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation and is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  This will give Bob an incentive to negotiate and potentially reach a price that's beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1300000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  However, it's getting closer. I will counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000.
