"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000.  It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you as well."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1300000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1350000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000, but it's closer to his preferred price point.  While he could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or the negotiation dragging on makes accepting her offer a sensible choice.  It's a good deal for both parties, with Alice getting a price closer to her desired $1,500,000 and Bob getting a price that's within his budget."
