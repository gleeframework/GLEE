"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We have plenty of room to negotiate and should try to get closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a lower offer ($70) gives us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $100 maximum and John's alternative offer. This approach aims to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a great deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we can still do better.  We'll reject this offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. Let's make this happen - how about $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're splitting the difference between our previous offer ($70) and her counteroffer ($80). This shows willingness to negotiate towards a fair price.  We're getting closer to her likely selling point while still maintaining a good margin."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair price Bob, I'm firm on $80, take it or leave it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has reached her lowest acceptable price, which is a great deal for us. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and waiting longer risks missing out on the product or having to buy it from John for $100."
