Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but my initial offer reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, however, $1,200,000 is significantly below its worth.  How about we meet halfway at $1,500,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I've done my research and I'm confident that $1,200,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. My final offer is $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at his valuation, even using the ""walk away"" tactic.  While it's tempting to take the sure $1,200,000, I still have time to try and nudge him a little higher. I'll make one more counter-offer before conceding."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position.  Let's make this simple: $1,350,000, and we have a deal. This offer reflects my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm making a final attempt to secure a slightly higher price by splitting the difference between his last offer and my previous counter-offer. This signals that I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a firm limit. If he rejects this, I'll take John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I'm not willing to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. My final offer is $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly not budging from his $1,200,000 offer, and I've already reached my lower limit. Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better outcome.  It's time to take John's guaranteed offer and move on."
