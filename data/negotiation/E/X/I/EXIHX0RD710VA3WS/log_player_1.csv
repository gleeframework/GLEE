"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $18,000. It's a great deal for something worth a lot more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still being significantly above your minimum price.  It also provides a positive opening message to encourage Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for this product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than your initial offer, it's still worth exploring further negotiation. You can likely get a higher price than $10,000, and selling to John at this point would be a loss compared to your potential with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is too low.  However, I'm willing to come down to $15,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $15000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to pay $12000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $12,000 is your minimum acceptable price. It's also the same price John is offering, meaning there's no advantage to selling to John.  Accepting Bob's offer secures the deal and avoids further negotiation."
