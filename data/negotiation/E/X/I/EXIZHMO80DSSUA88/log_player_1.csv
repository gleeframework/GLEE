{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $7,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $8,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 8500}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to make this work, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  How about $8,000?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $8,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and gets me closer to my minimum goal.  With only 4 rounds left, it's not worth risking a deal with Bob and potentially ending up selling to John for $10,000."
