"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $7500 to make this deal work.  This is still a great price for the value you'll get, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy.  What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $6000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $6000 is simply not a price I can accept. I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product for $7000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive, and it's the closest I can go. If you're still interested, let's close this deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",7000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your concession, but $7000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $5500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",5500.0,Bob,6,
