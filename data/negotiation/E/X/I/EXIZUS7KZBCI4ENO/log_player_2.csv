Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount, but I still believe the product's value is higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1400000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than $1200000.
