"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount, but I still believe the product's value is higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1400000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle at $1200000. This would be a fair price considering the value to me and still allow you a profit. ",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than $1200000.

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1300000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000, which is my final offer. This would be a fair price, giving you a profit while staying within my budget.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1300000 and $1200000, which is $1250000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth.
