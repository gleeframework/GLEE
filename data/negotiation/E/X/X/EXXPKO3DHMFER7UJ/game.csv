"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $80 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $90? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to go up to $85, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this work, I need to be closer to $90.  I'm willing to come down to $88. This is my final offer,  let me know what you think.",88.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but $88 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $82.50, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",82.5,Bob,6,
