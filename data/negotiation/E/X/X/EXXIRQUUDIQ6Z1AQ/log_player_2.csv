"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good deal, it's still more than the product is worth to Bob.  He has 10 rounds and can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than the product's value to her.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also showing Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $87.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $87.50 is a better offer than $90, Bob still wants to save as much money as possible. There are still several rounds left, so he can likely get a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still hoping to get the product a little lower. I'm willing to pay $86. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 86} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows that Bob is still willing to negotiate and is aiming for a price closer to his target of $85. The offer of $86 is a small increase from his previous offer, demonstrating his desire to reach a compromise but still maintain some leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $86, but I need to make a slight adjustment to ensure I'm not losing too much. I'm willing to go to $86.25. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $86.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $86.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met Bob halfway at $86.25.  At this point, Bob has two options:

* **Accept the offer:**  He gets the product for $86.25, which is a good price and within his budget. 
* **Reject the offer:** There's a chance he could get a slightly lower price, but it's risky. He's already had four rounds of negotiation, and there's no guarantee Alice will continue to lower her price. Also, buying from John for $120 is a much worse deal.

Given the risk of not closing the deal and the possibility of getting a much worse price from John, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice."
