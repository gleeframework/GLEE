"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think you'll really love it! As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $8,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your potential interest in it.",8000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $8,000 is a bit too steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it, given my budget and the market value I've researched.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $9,500. Considering the product's value and the initial offer I made, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $9,750. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9750.0,Alice,3,
