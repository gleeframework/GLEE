Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think you'll really love it! As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $8,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $8,000 is a bit too steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it, given my budget and the market value I've researched.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $9,500.

Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 9750}"
