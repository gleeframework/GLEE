Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $100 is below my minimum value, and I believe I can get a better price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm countering with $130. This is still above my minimum value and hopefully is more appealing to Bob than his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is insistent on his price, and I don't think I'll be able to get him to budge.  Selling to John for $120 ensures I meet my minimum value, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price."
