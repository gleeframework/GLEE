Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000 vs. $1,200,000) sets a strong anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, the final price is likely to be higher than if we started lower. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""worth,"" we subtly reinforce why the price is justified, even if it's above Bob's initial perception.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob's input and potential negotiation. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk:** There's a chance Bob might reject this offer outright. However, we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, ensuring we don't lose out completely.
* **Information:**  This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's financial limits or negotiation style beyond his valuation of the product."
