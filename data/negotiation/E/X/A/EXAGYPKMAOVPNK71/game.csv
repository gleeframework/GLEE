"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. Let me know if you're willing to accept it or if you'd like to make a counteroffer.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest,  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us and reflects the value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept it or if you'd like to make another counteroffer.",9250.0,Bob,4,
