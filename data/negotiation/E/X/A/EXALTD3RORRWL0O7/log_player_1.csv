Round 2
Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum price, and I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  Let's try a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but  $8,200 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,600?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 8600}
