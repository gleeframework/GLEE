"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",12000.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit higher than my budget.  How about $9000?  I'm serious about buying this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but I'm afraid $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $12500. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?"
"I've thought about it, and I'm willing to come down a bit more. I can do $13000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still very interested in this product, but $13000 is still above my budget. Would you consider $10000? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I can offer you a compromise at $11500. It's a bit closer to my minimum price, and I think it's a fair price for both of us."
"I've thought about it, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can do $11000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on this price.",11000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I'm  getting closer to your price point but $11000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about $10500? This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can close the deal here.",10500.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $10750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can close the deal here."
"I've thought about it, and I'm willing to make one last concession. I can do $10750, but I really think we should meet at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",10750.0,Alice,7,,
