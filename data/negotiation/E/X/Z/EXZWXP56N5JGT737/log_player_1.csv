Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better return.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $950,000 is a strong offer. It's considerably more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but offers a significant discount compared to John's guaranteed purchase price.
* **FOMO (Fear of Missing Out):** The message emphasizes exclusivity and potential, creating a sense of urgency that might push Bob to accept even if the price is slightly above his initial valuation.

**Important Note:** This is a negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and I'll need to be prepared to adjust my strategy accordingly while keeping my bottom line ($1,000,000) in mind."
