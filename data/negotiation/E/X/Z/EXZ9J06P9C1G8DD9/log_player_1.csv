"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This gives me a good starting point, and allows some room for negotiation.  Since Bob values the product at $100, it's a price he might consider, and I'll still be making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm offering $105. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping he'll accept this, as it's a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll reject his offer again and see if he's willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm now offering the product for $100, which is my minimum acceptable price.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering he values the product at $100. Hopefully, Bob will accept and we can close the deal."
