"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fair price considering its value and the opportunity it presents. Let me know what you think!",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,450,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my expectations.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable margin for both of us. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something nearer to $1,150,000.  Would that be agreeable to you?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit low for me. To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000. This represents a compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
