"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get closer to the value it has to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still be a great value for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.",9800.0,Bob,4,
