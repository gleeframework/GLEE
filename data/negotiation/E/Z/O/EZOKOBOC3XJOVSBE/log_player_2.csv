"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe will bring you significant value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* You are willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product.
* Alice's offer of $900,000 is better than John's offer of $1,000,000.
* However, you can do better by rejecting Alice's offer and negotiating a lower price. You might be able to get closer to Alice's value of $800,000."
