"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a rare opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you. To start the negotiation, I'm offering it to you for $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe my initial valuation is closer to the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,225,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential returns you'll see.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still not willing to go up to $1,150,000. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000, which is the price I mentioned in my previous offer. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1075000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I feel we're at an impasse. I need to be compensated fairly for this product and its value. I'm willing to consider $1,125,000, but this is non-negotiable.  If you're unable to meet this price, I'll need to explore other options.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
