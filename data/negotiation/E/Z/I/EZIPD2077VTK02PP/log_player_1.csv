While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offers are escalating slowly and still fall significantly below my minimum price. It's unlikely he'll reach a number acceptable to me in a reasonable timeframe. John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price, so it makes the most financial sense to proceed with him."
