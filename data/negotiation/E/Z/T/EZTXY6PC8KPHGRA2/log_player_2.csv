"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this unique product, which I believe will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000, a price that I believe is a fair reflection of its worth to you, while also ensuring a healthy profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you have a backup option with John for $1,000,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price, closer to Alice's value of $800,000. If Alice doesn't budge much, you can always fall back on buying from John."
