"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $18,000 to start the negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is way too high. It's much better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $18,000 is way too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 if it's in good condition."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** Starting with a much lower offer ($8,000) leaves room for negotiation while signaling I'm serious about buying but not at an inflated price.
* **Anchoring:**  By throwing out a lower number first, I'm trying to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range. 
* **Leaving Alice Room:** This gives Alice a chance to counter and shows I'm willing to engage, but only up to a certain point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly lower than its value. I could consider letting it go for $15,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $15,000 is still too high.  We're getting closer to my limit, but there's room to negotiate further. It's worth seeing if she'll move closer to the $10,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  That's a fair offer that gets us closer to a deal."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards a Deal:**  I'm signaling that I'm willing to increase my offer, but not drastically.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $11,500 keeps me above my walk-away price ($10,000) while still leaving room to negotiate if Alice rejects it.
* **Compromise Language:** Using phrases like ""meet in the middle"" and ""fair offer"" emphasizes a collaborative approach to the negotiation."
