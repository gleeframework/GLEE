Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is willing to meet me at this price, or if he'll counter with a lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm hoping to get more. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate and come down from my initial asking price.  Hopefully, this will be a more appealing price for Bob while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge from his $100 offer.  I've already made a concession, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $100."
