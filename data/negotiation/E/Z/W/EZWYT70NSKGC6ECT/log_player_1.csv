"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum value. I'm going to try to get closer to my target by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $9,500. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  That way we both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Bob is still stubbornly low. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can budge him. It's getting risky, but I'm not ready to settle for his price yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here, but $8,000 is just too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $8,750? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a decent deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still thinking $8,000 is the sweet spot. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob is clearly not going to budge from his price.  I've already made several concessions, and I'm starting to run out of time.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  At least I'll get my minimum value that way."
