"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'd love. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, and I'm willing to let it go for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand it's a bit high for you. I'm willing to come down a bit but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $7,750. Can you consider that?",7750.0,Bob,4,
