Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm motivated to sell, but need to ensure a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $13,500? I'm really interested in the product and I think this price is fair.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently increasing his offer in small increments, and it's unlikely he'll reach a price close to your $15,000 minimum within the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
