Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is my maximum budget for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, your final offer is still quite a way off from what I consider a fair deal.  I'm willing to accept $1,020,000.  This offer takes into account your budget constraints while still reflecting the product's value."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $1,020,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to think that buying from John might be a better option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is getting too close for comfort. Bob is getting close to John's offer, and the time pressure is on. 

```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While I could try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, there's a real risk he'll walk away. Selling to John guarantees the full $1,200,000 and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
