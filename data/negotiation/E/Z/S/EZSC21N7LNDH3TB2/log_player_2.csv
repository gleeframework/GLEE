"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $110.  I think it's a great deal and you'll be very happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before considering John's offer. $110 is too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaving room for further negotiation. This approach aims to bring the price closer to a point where we maximize our savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we can still try to get a better deal. We're getting close to a price that would be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can nudge her a bit further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $100 is getting closer.  How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

We're proposing a price that splits the difference between her last offer and our previous counteroffer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that benefits us."
