"I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $980000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",980000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $980000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1020000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last offer, so I'll counter with $1010000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1010000.0,Bob,6,
