"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a strong anchor. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and make subsequent offers seem more reasonable.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price provides ample room for negotiation over the remaining rounds. 
* **Confidence:**  A confident opening offer suggests you believe in the product's value.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while leaving room to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,400,000. This is my initial counteroffer. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to your minimum, you still have room to negotiate. Accepting now would leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table.  You'll aim to bring the price closer to $1,600,000 in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price, however, the value this product brings is truly unique. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This reflects the true worth of what you're gaining."", 
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're showing willingness to negotiate by lowering your price, but not drastically. This keeps you in a strong position.
* **Value Emphasis:**  By reiterating the product's value, you're reminding Bob of its benefits and justifying the higher price point.
* **Target Price:** This counteroffer moves closer to the midpoint between Bob's offer and your desired selling price. You are aiming for around $1,600,000 or slightly higher if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of a price of $1,200,000. Can we get closer to a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches your minimum acceptable price. While you could try to negotiate for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk he may walk away. You have a guaranteed offer from John for the same amount, eliminating the risk of further negotiation. It's in your best interest to secure the guaranteed sale at your desired minimum."
