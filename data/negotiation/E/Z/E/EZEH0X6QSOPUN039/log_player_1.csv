Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer is a bit of a gamble. It's higher than your guaranteed price from John, but it gives you the potential to earn more.  Here's why I chose this price:

* **Potential for a better deal:**  You have no information about Bob's perceived value of the product. By offering a price higher than your guaranteed $12,000, you might be able to secure a better deal if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Limited risk:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell to John for your minimum acceptable price. 

Let's see if Bob bites!"
