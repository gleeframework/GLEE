"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point as it's a reasonable price for Bob, and I'm still getting a good profit.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $110. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to counter with $100. This is a compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. I'm willing to give a little ground, but I still want to get a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
```

I'm going to counter with $98. This is a small compromise but I believe it's a good balance between getting closer to Bob's offer and ensuring a decent profit for myself. We're getting closer, and I'm hopeful he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough decision! While $88 is not my ideal price, it's still a decent profit, and I'm running out of rounds. I'm afraid if I reject Bob's offer, he might get even more stubborn, and I might end up having to sell to John for $80. It's better to take the $88 now."
