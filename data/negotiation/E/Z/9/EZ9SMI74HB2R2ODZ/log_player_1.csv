Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of this product,  $950,000 is a bit too high for me at this point.  I'm interested in acquiring the product, but I'm prepared to offer $700,000.  This offer reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

However, I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging your concerns about the initial price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm willing to go up to $775,000 for the product.  This offer represents a significant step toward a deal and shows my commitment to acquiring this asset.  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement in this round.
