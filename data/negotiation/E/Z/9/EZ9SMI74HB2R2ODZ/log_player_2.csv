"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to jump at the first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of this product,  $950,000 is a bit too high for me at this point.  I'm interested in acquiring the product, but I'm prepared to offer $700,000.  This offer reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging your concerns about the initial price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, though it's getting closer to where I want to be. I'm going to reject the offer and try to push for a lower price.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $775,000 for the product.  This offer represents a significant step toward a deal and shows my commitment to acquiring this asset.  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 775000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. $775,000 is getting closer to my target, but I'm still not quite there. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is still higher than my ideal price, but it's getting very close. It's also important to note that we're already in Round 5.  The risk of continuing negotiations is that I might not be able to get a better deal, and I might end up having to buy from John for a much higher price. 

By accepting this offer, I secure the product for a price that's still within my budget and saves me a significant amount compared to John's offer."
