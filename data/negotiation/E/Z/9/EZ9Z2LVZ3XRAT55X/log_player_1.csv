Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

I'm starting with a price that's below what the product is worth to Bob, but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. This should encourage him to negotiate while still giving me room to potentially get a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,400,000. I'm confident that this price is fair, considering the product's value to both of us. I'm hoping Bob will see the value and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to meet my minimum acceptable price.  Selling to John at $1,000,000 is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with an even lower offer."
