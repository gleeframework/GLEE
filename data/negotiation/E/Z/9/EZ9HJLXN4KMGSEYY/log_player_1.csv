"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it's a great fit for your needs. My asking price is $12,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially capture more of the value.
* **Clear Communication:** I'm being upfront about my price and highlighting the potential benefits for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, setting the stage for a potential back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product and would like to make a counteroffer of $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** It's below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested in the product. There's still room for negotiation to get a better price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John now would guarantee $10,000, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but still staying above my minimum.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product offers, justifying the price.
* **Open invitation:** I'm keeping the communication open and encouraging Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering the value I believe the product provides, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer to my minimum of $10,000, it's still not a price that I'm comfortable with.
* **Time is on my side:** I have several rounds left, and I'm confident that I can still negotiate a better price.
* **Selling to John is a backup:** If the negotiations fail, I can always sell to John for $10,000.

I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $10,500 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm showing willingness to compromise further by meeting Bob halfway between my last offer and his.
* **Emphasizing time and value:**  I'm reminding Bob that we've been negotiating for a while and that the product is still valuable. 
* **Direct and concise:**  I'm keeping the message short and focused on closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment, I would like to counteroffer at $10,800. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's getting closer, $10,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Limited rounds left:** I only have 4 rounds remaining.  While I want to get the best possible price, I also need to be mindful of the time constraint.
* **Selling to John is a backup:** If I don't reach a deal with Bob, I can still sell to John for $10,000.

I'm willing to risk one more round to see if I can get Bob to meet my minimum price, but if that doesn't work, I'll switch to selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we've been going back and forth for a while, and I'm really interested in making this deal work. I'm going to make one last offer of $10,900. This is my absolute minimum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my last counteroffer, highlighting its importance to Bob.
* **Minimum Price:** I'm emphasizing this is my bottom line, creating urgency.
* **Value Reminder:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.

With only three rounds left, I'm taking a calculated risk by offering a price slightly above my minimum. This is to try and secure a deal with Bob. However, if he rejects this offer, I'll switch to selling to John."
