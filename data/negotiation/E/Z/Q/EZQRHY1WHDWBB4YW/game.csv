"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your need for a more manageable figure.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
