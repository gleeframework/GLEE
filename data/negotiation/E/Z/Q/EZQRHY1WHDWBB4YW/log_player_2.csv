"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is within Bob's budget, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to stay within a specific budget. Would you consider $1,300,000 for the product? This is a fair price that reflects its value to me while remaining within my financial constraints."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your need for a more manageable figure. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice's offer of $1,375,000 is lower than John's price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is progressing:**  Alice has moved from her initial $1,400,000 offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal with Alice (who has shown flexibility) outweighs the potential reward of a slightly lower price.

Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $125,000 compared to buying from John."
