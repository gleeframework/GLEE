"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's always a good idea to try and negotiate, especially when you know the seller is motivated to sell.  You can do better than $1,150,000."

You're still within your budget and you've established a clear lower limit that Alice is willing to consider.  Keep negotiating!"
