"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower. Given my budget and the price I can get from John, I'm going to offer $1,050,000.  This is still a fair price for a product you value at $1,200,000, and it allows for some wiggle room for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and for understanding the value of this product. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is a tempting offer, I'm aiming for something closer to my original price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,075,000. This would be a great deal for both of us and allow us to move forward quickly.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
