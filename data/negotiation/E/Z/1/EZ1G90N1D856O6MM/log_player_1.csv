Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $150 to me, I'll start with a relatively high price. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": $160}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer of $140. Since this is lower than my minimum price of $150, I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further. I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than $140 but lower than my minimum price.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": $145}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!"
