"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price from Alice first."

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation.  We'll see how Alice responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $1,050,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is meeting us halfway from her original offer, we're still closer to John's price. We can push a bit further to see if we can get a better deal from Alice."

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $975,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",

We're splitting the difference between her current offer and our previous one. This keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a price closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It seems Alice is unlikely to go much lower.  While we could continue negotiating, accepting her last offer would only save us $25,000 compared to John's price. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation, so we'll buy from John."
