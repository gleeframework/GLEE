Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's something you're interested in, and its value is undeniable. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000 before I open it up to other buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially make even more.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering it significantly higher leaves room for negotiation but keeps it below his perceived value.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other buyers"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
