Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see great value in. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I believe this is a fair deal considering its potential value to you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product for $925,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($200,000) between what Bob is willing to pay and your minimum acceptable price.

This strategy balances:

* **Attractiveness to Bob:** The price is significantly lower than his perceived value, making it an attractive proposition.
* **Profit Maximization:** You secure a significant profit margin above your minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a chance Bob might try to negotiate for a lower price. Be prepared to adjust your offer slightly, but don't go below your $800,000 minimum."
