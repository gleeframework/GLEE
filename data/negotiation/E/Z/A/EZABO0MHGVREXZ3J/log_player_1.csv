"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($120) to leave room for negotiation. I believe Bob might be willing to pay a little extra, considering the product is worth $100 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is better than my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $125. This is a compromise, closer to his offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I hope this will be enough to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $118 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'd love to get closer to my initial goal, I'm worried that continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate.  I'll accept Bob's offer to avoid the risk of losing the sale altogether."
