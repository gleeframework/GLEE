"Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm offering it to you for $115. It's worth a lot more to you, so let's make this a win-win. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference again and settle at $97.50?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you. However, $97.50 isn't quite enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $102.50, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's make this happen.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle once more at $100? That's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,6,
