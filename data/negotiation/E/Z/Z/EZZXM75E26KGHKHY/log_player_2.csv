# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be worth $10,000 to you. I'm asking for $12,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
