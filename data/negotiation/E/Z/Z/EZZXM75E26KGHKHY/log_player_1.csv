Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be worth $10,000 to you. I'm asking for $12,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob.
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $2,000 markup (20%) is significant but not outrageous. It allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a higher profit. 
* **Clear Value Proposition:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the higher price. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have some leverage and that Bob might be willing to pay a premium to secure the product immediately. It's a starting point for negotiation."
