"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its potential worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is only $1,000 less than your maximum budget and significantly higher than its value to her ($8,000). 
* By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or move on to John.
* While John's price is your maximum budget, it's still better to attempt getting a lower price from Alice first."
