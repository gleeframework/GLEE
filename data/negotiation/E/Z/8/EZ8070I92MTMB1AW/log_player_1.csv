{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a safety net with John at $8,000, you want to aim for the highest possible profit. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  You know the product is worth $10,000 to Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it slightly below his valuation ($9,500) makes it very attractive to Bob while still securing a significant profit for you.

This offer balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob could try to negotiate, but the high price is anchored close to his perceived value. If he rejects it, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer."
