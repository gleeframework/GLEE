"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit high for me.  How about $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do $88, but that's as low as I can go. I've already made a concession from my initial offer of $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $88 is a good price, it's still above the value of the product to you ($80). You can likely negotiate further and get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $88 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about $86? I'm very serious about buying this, so I hope we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 86}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're serious about buying the product, Bob. I can meet you halfway between $86 and $88, so I'll offer it to you for $87. This is my final concession. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While you could try to counteroffer again, Alice has made it clear that $87 is her final offer. At this point, accepting the offer is the best option:

* **It's within your budget:** You're willing to pay up to $100, and $87 is significantly lower.
* **It's a good deal:** You're getting the product for $7 more than its value to Alice, which is a decent saving.
* **You risk losing the deal:** If you reject the offer and continue negotiating, you run the risk of Alice changing her mind or walking away from the deal altogether.  Additionally, you could end up paying more by buying from John."
