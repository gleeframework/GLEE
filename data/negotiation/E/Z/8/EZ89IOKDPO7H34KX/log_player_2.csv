"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still possible to negotiate further and potentially get an even better deal.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can explore the possibility of lowering the price even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $1,000,000 is a bold move, but it might be enough to entice Alice to consider a lower price. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can then adjust his counteroffer based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and significantly lower than buying from John. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might walk away, or that he could end up paying more than $1,100,000 in the long run.  Accepting the offer secures a decent deal within Bob's budget."
