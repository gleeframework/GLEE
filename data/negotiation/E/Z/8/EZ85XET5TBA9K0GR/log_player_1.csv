"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This creates room for negotiation and allows me to explore Bob's potential interest.
* **Strategic Approach:** By starting high, I'm aiming to gauge Bob's willingness to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects this initial offer, it gives me valuable information about his perceived value and potential counteroffers. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  While $1,500,000 is ambitious, it leaves room for negotiation and compromise, which is crucial in a deal like this. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy for subsequent rounds. 
* If he rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or explore selling to John.
* If he accepts, I've secured a successful sale!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Too Low:**  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer would mean losing a substantial amount of money.
* **Selling to John is a Safer Option:**  While $1,000,000 from John is not ideal, it's still a better deal than accepting Bob's offer. Selling to John guarantees a secure return above my minimum threshold. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a better price.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to reach a price that is closer to my desired value. However, I'll remain cautious and keep the option of selling to John as a backup in case negotiations don't yield a satisfactory outcome."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Negotiation:**  I'm lowering my price from $1,500,000 to $1,200,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still not willing to settle for a price too far below my desired value.
* **Strategic Middle Ground:**  $1,200,000 is a point where I'm comfortable with a potential deal, but it also leaves some room for further negotiation if Bob is still unwilling to meet me halfway.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By staying above $1,000,000, I maintain leverage in the negotiation and avoid a situation where I'm forced to accept a price below my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely observe Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I've achieved a successful sale. If he rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or explore selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Below Minimum:** $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer would mean losing money on the deal.
* **Potential for a Better Outcome:** Although it's only the fourth round, I'm sensing Bob might be willing to pay closer to my minimum if pushed further. There's a chance we can bridge the gap.
* **Selling to John is Still a Safety Net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, selling to John guarantees me my minimum and eliminates risk.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. This time, I'll aim for a price that's closer to my desired value.  I'll also be prepared to sell to John if negotiations continue to stall."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  I'm lowering my offer again to $1,100,000, further demonstrating my commitment to a deal with Bob. This offer is closer to his last counteroffer, indicating my willingness to meet him halfway. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  While I'm lowering my price, I'm still holding firm above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. This prevents me from losing too much in the negotiation.
* **Creating Pressure:**  By making a significant move towards Bob's position, I'm putting pressure on him to reciprocate. I'm hoping this will encourage him to consider a higher price in the next round. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, we've reached a mutually agreeable price. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to continue negotiating or proceed with selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer would be a financial loss.
* **Progress but Not Enough:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's not yet a deal I'm comfortable with. 
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to maximize my chances of reaching a more favorable price. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to take a risk and continue negotiating to see if I can secure a price closer to my desired value.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to bridge the gap and reach a mutually acceptable price.  If I don't see significant movement in Bob's offers, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the final rounds to avoid the risk of settling for a price too far below my minimum."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:**  I'm making a final push towards a deal with Bob by lowering my price to $1,050,000. This offer is a significant compromise, demonstrating my commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Close to Minimum:** This price is only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable value, leaving very little room for further concessions.
* **Limited Time:**  With only three rounds remaining, it's crucial to signal to Bob that I'm nearing my limit.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob accepts this offer, I've successfully closed a deal. If he rejects it, I'll have to evaluate my options carefully. With only two rounds left, I'll need to decide whether to continue negotiating with Bob or sell to John to guarantee a minimum return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Almost There, But Not Quite:**  While Bob's offer is now only $20,000 below my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm very close to securing my minimum, but I'm not willing to accept a loss.
* **Time is Running Out:**  With only two rounds left, the pressure is on to make a decision. 
* **A Final Chance to Negotiate:**  I believe there's still a chance I can convince Bob to meet my minimum price.

Round 9

{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Stand:** This is my final counteroffer. I'm offering the product at my absolute minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **No Room for Compromise:** I've exhausted all room for negotiation and am now firm on my minimum.
* **High Stakes:** This is a high-stakes round. If Bob rejects, I have no choice but to sell to John in the final round.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured my desired outcome.
* If Bob rejects, I will sell the product to John in the final round to avoid a loss."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Round:** This is the last round of negotiations.
* **Minimum Not Met:** Bob's final offer of $990,000 is still $10,000 below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Guaranteed Return:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum return and avoids any further risk of losing money on the deal.

**Conclusion:**

Despite reaching a near-deal with Bob, it's not worth the risk of accepting his final offer and losing a small amount of money. By selling to John, I secure a guaranteed return and avoid the possibility of a less favorable outcome."
