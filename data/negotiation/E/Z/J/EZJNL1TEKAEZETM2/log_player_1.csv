Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,150,000 is more than your minimum of $1,000,000, ensuring you profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still space to negotiate, giving Bob the feeling he can get a better deal. 
* **It's a strong starting position:** It's closer to Bob's value than to your minimum, potentially encouraging him to accept.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit. You can adjust the price based on Bob's reaction and your confidence in getting a better offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I have a budget in mind and I'd like to stay within it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above John's offer, it's still significantly below your desired profit margin. You've already demonstrated your willingness to negotiate, and Bob has shown he's also willing to compromise.  By rejecting his offer, you can:

* **Continue negotiating:**  You can try to meet in the middle or explore a counteroffer closer to your desired price.
* **Show your resolve:**  Rejecting the offer demonstrates that you're not desperate to sell and that you're serious about getting a better price.

Remember, you have the option to sell to John at any time, but you're better off pushing for a higher price with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of your profit.  You're meeting Bob halfway, but still maintaining a significant profit margin.
* **Emphasis on value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value to him can help justify the price.
* **Positive tone:**  The message uses a positive tone to encourage further negotiation and maintain a good rapport with Bob.

This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise that may encourage Bob to accept. However, you're still open to further negotiation if he rejects it. You have the option to sell to John at any time, so don't be afraid to push for a price that's closer to your desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,125,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to your desired price, and it represents a significant profit margin for you.  

While you could potentially push for a slightly higher price, the risk is that Bob will walk away entirely and you'll be forced to sell to John at a lower price.  

Accepting this offer ensures a solid profit and allows you to finalize the sale without the risk of further negotiation."
