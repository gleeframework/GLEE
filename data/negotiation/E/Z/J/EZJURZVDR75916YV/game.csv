"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $18000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $14000 for the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15000, but that's my absolute top. Let's see if we can make this work.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $15000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $16200. This is my final concession, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",16200.0,Alice,5,
