"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is asking for more. It's best to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $16000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still get the product for a lower price from John, and there are more rounds to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,000, but that's my absolute top. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $15000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $16200. This is my final concession, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should choose to buy from John. 

Alice is very close to Bob's maximum price, but she's still not willing to go down to $15,000.  There's only a small chance that she'll accept a counteroffer, and Bob has already made his best offer.  Given that John is a sure thing at $15,000, it's better to avoid the risk of Alice rejecting another offer and ending up paying more."
