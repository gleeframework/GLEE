Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're being firm, but I'm not willing to give up on a better price. I can meet you at $105, but I'm not going any higher than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $105.  You've been firm and clear with your offers. Accepting $105 saves you $45 compared to John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns and risks the deal falling through."
