Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $100, so this offer leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to accept no less than $120, so you have room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **It shows you're willing to compromise:**  This signals you're open to a deal, but you also value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120. It's also below the midpoint between your initial offer ($115) and Bob's offer ($105).  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going and gives you a chance to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? That seems fair considering we're both willing to compromise."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $110 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay, but I'm still interested in the product. I'd be willing to go up to $108, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $108 is a bit closer to my minimum price, it's still not ideal.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay $120, I'm going to take that deal.  There's no guarantee that Bob will accept another counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing out on a better price."
