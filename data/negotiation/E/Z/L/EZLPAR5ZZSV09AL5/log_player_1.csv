"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you in the long run. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  I'm aiming high, hoping to get a price closer to my minimum value. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the potential value to Bob, suggesting it's a good investment for him. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not going all-in on my minimum, allowing for potential counteroffers. 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  While I want to get the best deal from Bob, I'm aware that John is a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer to my ideal price, it's still $100,000 below my minimum value.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** I have 8 rounds left, and I believe I can squeeze out a better deal. 
* **John is a safety net:**  If I can't get a better price from Bob, John is a secure alternative. 

I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  That's a fair price that acknowledges both of our needs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:** I'm meeting Bob halfway again, aiming to find a compromise that benefits both of us.
* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  $1,050,000 is a significant move from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining a strong position:** I'm still above my minimum value, ensuring I don't sell for less than what the product is worth to me. 
* **Keep John in mind:**  I'm still aware of John as a backup, but I'm confident I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While it's getting closer, $950,000 is still $50,000 below my minimum value.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** With 6 rounds left, there's still time to negotiate a better price. 
* **John is a strong safety net:** If I can't close a deal with Bob, selling to John guarantees I'll reach my minimum.

I'll counteroffer again in the next round, but I'll need to be strategic about how much I'm willing to come down."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $950,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer strategy:** I'm signaling to Bob that this is my last concession, hoping to encourage him to accept.
* **Meeting my minimum:** $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal.
* **Time pressure:** With only 5 rounds left, the pressure is on. 
* **John is a backup:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John and achieve my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one last offer: $925,000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $925,000 is still $75,000 below my minimum.
* **Limited time:**  We are down to 4 rounds. With only a few rounds remaining, it is highly unlikely that Bob will increase his offer enough to meet my minimum.
* **John is a guaranteed alternative:**  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum value, and there's no risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price.

It's time to take the guaranteed option and sell to John."
