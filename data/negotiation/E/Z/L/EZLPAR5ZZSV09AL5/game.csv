"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you in the long run. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  That's a fair price that acknowledges both of our needs.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $950,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make one last offer: $925,000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you meet me at this price?",925000.0,Bob,6,
