{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $900,000. It's a steal at this price, considering its value to you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}

This offer starts the negotiation high, aiming to secure a good price while leaving room for potential counteroffers.  We'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $700,000 is still a good price, it's significantly lower than my target. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I can't meet your exact price, I'm willing to come down to $750,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

This counteroffer offers a compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer while still securing a decent profit. I hope Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can you do $725,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $725,000 is a good compromise.  It's closer to my desired price and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  It's time to accept Bob's offer and move on."
