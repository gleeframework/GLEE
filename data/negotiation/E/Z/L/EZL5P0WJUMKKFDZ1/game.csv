"Bob, I understand your position. While I value your interest, $1200000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1300000.  This would allow me to make a fair profit while still being a good deal for you.  Let me know if this works for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
