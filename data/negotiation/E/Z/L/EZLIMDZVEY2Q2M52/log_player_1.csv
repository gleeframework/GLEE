"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, knowing I have room to negotiate if needed. This should pique Bob's interest without being too off-putting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only afford to pay up to $7,500 for it. I hope this offer works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm not willing to sell at a loss, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob or potentially John. I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll still get great value from the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 
I'm proposing a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price. This shows I'm flexible while remaining firm in my desire to get a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $8,000 for the product. This is the maximum I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me! Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price. There's no reason to keep negotiating further as I'm getting the value I need, and it's unlikely I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds."
