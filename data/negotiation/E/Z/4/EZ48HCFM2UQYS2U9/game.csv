,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $175. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the benefits of this product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $175. I'm willing to go up to $155, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $155. I can offer you the product for $165, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but still a great value. Let's meet in the middle again!",165.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $160. I can offer you the product for $170, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but still a great value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again!",170.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back and forth. I'm willing to meet you at $162, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you accept this offer?",162.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're feeling frustrated, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $162. I can offer you the product for $168, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but still a great value. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",168.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made a few compromises, but I'm still not willing to go above $160. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $150. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.",160.0,Bob,10,
