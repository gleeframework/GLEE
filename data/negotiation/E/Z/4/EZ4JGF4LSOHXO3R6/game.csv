"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us.  You'll be getting a valuable product at a price significantly lower than its worth to you, and I'll be able to move the product quickly.  Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is just too low for me.  I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This would give you a good deal, and it would be a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us - I can afford it and you'd still be getting a substantial price for the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Bob,4,
