"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us.  You'll be getting a valuable product at a price significantly lower than its worth to you, and I'll be able to move the product quickly.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  While it's a good deal for her, it's not a good deal for you.  Rejecting her offer allows you to negotiate a lower price or move on to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.  It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within your budget and allows for potential negotiation room. By mentioning a ""fair price"" and ""benefit for both of us,"" you're framing the offer as a win-win situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is just too low for me.  I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This would give you a good deal, and it would be a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,000,000 is still more than you are willing to pay. You are better off continuing to negotiate with Alice or going with John's offer.  Rejecting this offer allows you to either counter with a lower price or move on to John's deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us - I can afford it and you'd still be getting a substantial price for the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than your initial offer but still below Alice's current price point. By highlighting a ""good deal for both of us"" and a ""substantial price,"" you're emphasizing the win-win nature of the offer.  This approach continues to move the negotiation towards a possible agreement while staying within your budget constraints."
