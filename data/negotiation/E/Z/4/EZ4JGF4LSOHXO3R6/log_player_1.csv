Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us.  You'll be getting a valuable product at a price significantly lower than its worth to you, and I'll be able to move the product quickly.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits for both of us, creating a win-win scenario.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $1,200,000 is a significant amount of money, but it's below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  By mentioning John, I'm subtly reminding Bob of the opportunity cost of delaying a decision. 

This approach aims to create a positive starting point for negotiation, while also ensuring I don't give away too much value too early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial financial loss. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's still interested in the product. This indicates there's potential for further negotiation.  
* **Leveraging John:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage.  I can use John as a comparison point to demonstrate that I have other options.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle, but keeping my minimum price point in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is just too low for me.  I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This would give you a good deal, and it would be a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Fairness:** I emphasize that $1,000,000 is a fair price for both of us, highlighting the value of the product and the opportunity for him to get a good deal.
* **Staying Above My Minimum:**  $1,000,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't settle for a loss.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive tone, aiming to keep the negotiation open and collaborative. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response to this counteroffer. Depending on his response, I may need to adjust my offer further, but I will always keep my minimum acceptable price in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us - I can afford it and you'd still be getting a substantial price for the product. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price point. It's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it's a significant improvement from his previous offers. 
* **Potential for Profit:**  While $900,000 is not ideal, it's still a substantial amount of money. Accepting his offer would allow me to move the product quickly and realize some profit.
* **Risk of Stalemate:** If I continue to reject Bob's offers, there's a risk of a stalemate. Bob might become unwilling to negotiate further, or I could lose the opportunity to sell to him altogether. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While John is willing to pay $1,500,000, there's no guarantee he'll remain interested if I delay further.  

**Conclusion:**  

Given the current situation, accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic move. It allows me to secure a sale, avoid further negotiations, and minimize the risk of losing the deal entirely."
