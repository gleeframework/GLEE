"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than John's price, it's still above Bob's budget.  It makes sense to reject the offer and see if a counteroffer can get the price closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to start with a significant counteroffer, but not one that's so low that it's immediately rejected.  $850,000 is a good starting point. It's within Bob's budget and a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget.  While it's closer than before, it's still better to continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his budget while trying to be a bit more flexible. $875,000 is a reasonable compromise, offering a slight increase from his last offer, showing willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers are getting progressively higher, making it clear she is not willing to budge much. Bob has already rejected two counteroffers, and there's no guarantee Alice will accept his next one. At this point, the risk of continuing the negotiation is high.  It's safer and more cost-effective for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000, ensuring he stays within his budget."
