It's time to switch tactics. Alice is clearly unwilling to go below $72, and her counteroffers are getting smaller. It's unlikely she'll agree to anything significantly lower than $74.  You're better off securing the product from John at $80 than risking a higher price from Alice in the remaining rounds."
