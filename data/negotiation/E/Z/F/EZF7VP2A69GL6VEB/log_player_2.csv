You can still try to get a lower price. You're willing to pay up to $10,000, but Alice is only willing to sell for $8,000.  There's still room to negotiate."

You've come down to a point where the price is acceptable for you, and you're likely not going to get a better deal from Alice. You could try another counteroffer, but it's not worth the risk of Alice rejecting it and forcing you to buy from John for a higher price."
