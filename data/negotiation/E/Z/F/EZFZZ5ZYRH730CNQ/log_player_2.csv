"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and potentially working towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's more than double your maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  while I appreciate your confidence in the product, your starting price is significantly higher than my budget. To get this deal moving, I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is my maximum, and it reflects the value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you putting an offer on the table. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price was already taking your budget considerations into account. To find a middle ground, I propose we meet at $1,900,000. This reflects a considerable reduction on my end while acknowledging the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. It's still worth trying to negotiate further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still outside my comfortable price range. To show my continued interest, I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually beneficial price.  To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair deal considering the product's inherent value and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still too high for my budget. While we're getting closer, I'm running out of rounds, and it's unlikely Alice will come down enough in the remaining time. Buying from John at $800,000 is the safest option to ensure I get the product within my budget."
