"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. My initial price is $1,400,000, reflecting its significant worth and potential. Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There are 9 rounds left, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is still a fair price for the value it brings. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000,  given the significant value this product will bring to your business. This price still leaves room for us both to profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still asking more than Bob wants to pay, but she is coming down in price, indicating a willingness to negotiate.  Since there are still 7 rounds left, Bob can continue to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,250,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point, and I'm willing to compromise.  $1,250,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to accept $1,275,000.  This price acknowledges the value you'll get from the product while allowing me to achieve my desired outcome.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price.** The offer is only $25,000 above Bob's last counteroffer. 
* **There are only 5 rounds left.**  There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or Alice's price going back up. 
* **Bob's budget is still intact.**  Accepting this offer is a good compromise and ensures Bob gets the product while staying within his budget."
