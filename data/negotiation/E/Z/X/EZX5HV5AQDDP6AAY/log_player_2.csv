It's still worth trying to negotiate with Alice. $9,000 is closer to your target price, and we have more rounds to work with."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Let's try to meet in the middle with a slightly higher offer than before.  We're getting closer to Alice's target price, but still within our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While we're closer to our ideal price of $8,000, Alice's offer of $8,900 is within our budget and a reasonable compromise. We've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and continuing to haggle might risk Alice walking away or getting a better offer elsewhere."
