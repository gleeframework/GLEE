{""product_price"": 1000000}

With only 4 rounds left, I need to strike a balance between being aggressive and being reasonable."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high, but we're running out of rounds. I need to keep negotiating, but I'm also getting closer to my maximum price. Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round and try to get a more favorable price.  There are only 3 rounds left, so I need to be careful and strategize my next move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

With only 2 rounds left, I'm making a significant jump in my counteroffer.  I believe this is a reasonable offer, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it to avoid potentially getting nothing in the final round. This is a risky move, but with limited rounds, I'm willing to take a chance to try and secure the deal at a price that is still within my budget."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is the same as John's price.  With only one round left, there's no chance to negotiate further.  Since I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to buy from John.  I'm not able to get a better deal from Alice at this point, so buying from John guarantees I'll get the product for my maximum budget."
