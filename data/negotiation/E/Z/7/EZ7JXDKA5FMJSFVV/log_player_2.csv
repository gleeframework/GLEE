"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is your maximum value for the product, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer immediately.  You have 10 rounds to negotiate and potentially get a better price. Rejecting allows you to explore the possibility of a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $80 is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.  This initial counteroffer also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $100 to $95, which shows a willingness to negotiate. However, there's still room for improvement.  Rejecting her offer allows us to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to our desired $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've established that Alice is willing to negotiate, and our initial offer of $80 was rejected.  A counteroffer of $85 is a compromise that demonstrates our willingness to meet halfway while still trying to get a price we're happy with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price again, and at $90, it's getting closer to our desired price of $80.  We've already rejected her offer at $95, and it's possible she won't budge any further. Accepting her offer at $90 is a good compromise, especially considering we still have 5 rounds left to potentially negotiate a lower price.  We also want to avoid getting too greedy and risking losing the deal altogether."
