"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  Thank you for your offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it and my maximum budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $850000, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value you place on it and the minimum price I'm willing to accept.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1100000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit outside of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to pay $950000.  This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $950000 is a significant investment for you, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $1200000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm offering it to you for $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. While I value the product and your willingness to negotiate, $1050000 is still slightly outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $975000, which is a fair compromise considering the value you place on it and my budget. I hope we can finalize this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
