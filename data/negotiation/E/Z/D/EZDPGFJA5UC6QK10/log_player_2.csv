"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. 
* It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a lower price. You have a clear advantage as you know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, so you can use that knowledge to drive a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $850000, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value you place on it and the minimum price I'm willing to accept.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above your budget of $800,000, but you are getting closer to your target.
* You can still try to negotiate further, as Alice is clearly willing to lower her price.  
* You can use the knowledge of the product's value to her to try and get a better offer."

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $950000 is a significant investment for you, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $1200000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm offering it to you for $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than your budget of $800,000, but getting closer.  
* You have room to negotiate further, as she's already lowered her price from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000.
* You can use the fact that you know the product is worth more to her, to try and get a lower price."
