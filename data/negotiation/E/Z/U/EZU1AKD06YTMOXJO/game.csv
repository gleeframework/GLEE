"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $1,250,000. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,275,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
