"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to try and get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $1,250,000. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,275,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. If Alice rejects the next offer, Bob can always buy from John for a guaranteed price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still a bit too high. My absolute maximum is $1,225,000.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,237,500. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account your concerns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,237,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,237,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,237,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget of $1,200,000. At this point, Bob can guarantee the purchase at his target price by buying from John.  There's no guarantee that Alice will accept any further counteroffers, and time is running out.  It's time to secure the deal and avoid any further risk."
