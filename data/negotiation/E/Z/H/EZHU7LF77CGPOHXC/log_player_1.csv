"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a significant markup from my minimum value of $120. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit.  I'm curious to see if Bob is willing to pay this price, and how he will react."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it just yet.  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter with $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is getting closer to my desired price. While I could continue negotiating, I'm worried that I'll lose him entirely or run out of rounds.  I'm going to accept his offer and secure the sale."
