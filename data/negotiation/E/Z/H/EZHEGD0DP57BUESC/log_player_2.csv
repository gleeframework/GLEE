"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being flexible. I'm really interested in this product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $13,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $13,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $13,500.** This is better than John's price of $15,000.
* **Bob is trying to save money.** Accepting this offer saves Bob $1,500 compared to buying from John.
* **There is a chance Alice might reject a counteroffer.** If Bob rejects this offer and makes a counteroffer, Alice could refuse, forcing Bob to either accept a higher price from Alice or pay more to John.  It's safer to accept the current offer and secure the product at a good price."
