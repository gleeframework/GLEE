Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It's a high price, but it's the minimum I'm willing to accept given the product's value to me. If Bob rejects, I can always go to John, who is guaranteed to buy at my desired price. This strategy maximizes my potential earnings while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm hoping for. I'm going to counteroffer to see if I can push the price closer to my desired $1,000,000. There's a chance Bob will accept a slightly higher price, and I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's desire for a lower price while still pushing for a better deal than his initial counteroffer. It's a price that is likely to be acceptable to Bob, given that he's willing to pay $900,000, and it's also a price that is closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $920,000 is very close to my minimum, and it's a significant improvement over his previous offer.  While I would prefer $1,000,000,  the risk of further negotiation not yielding a better result, coupled with the opportunity cost of potential delays, makes accepting this offer the best option."
