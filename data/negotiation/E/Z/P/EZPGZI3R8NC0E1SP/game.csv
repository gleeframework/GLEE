"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit out of my price range. How about $85?  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. It's still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $100 to you. Let's make this happen!",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $88 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $89. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal!",89.0,Alice,5,
