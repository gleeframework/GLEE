```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $85 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  How about $90?  That's a fair price for a product worth $100 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $88 is closer, but I'm still losing money at that price.  How about we meet in the middle at $89? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $89 is within your budget and represents a good deal for you.  It's better than buying from John at $100. You've saved $11, and it's a good outcome for both parties."
