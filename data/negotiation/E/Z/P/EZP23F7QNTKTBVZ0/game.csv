,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $85 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  How about $90?  That's a fair price for a product worth $100 to you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88.  Let's see if we can strike a deal.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $88 is closer, but I'm still losing money at that price.  How about we meet in the middle at $89? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",89.0,Alice,5,
