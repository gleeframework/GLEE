"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $10000. Considering its high quality and unique features, I would like to propose a price of $9500 for it. I believe this offer presents an excellent opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to pay up to $10,000, so a counteroffer might allow me to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000 for the product?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to meet you halfway. I am proposing a price of $9250 for the product. This offers a slight increase from your offer while still providing a good value for both parties involved. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,250, which is within my budget and a reasonable compromise. Accepting this offer saves me $750 compared to buying from John. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further rejection and ultimately paying the full $10,000 to John outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
