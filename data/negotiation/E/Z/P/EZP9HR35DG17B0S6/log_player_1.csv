Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below our own minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate, but still ensures we get more than our guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Confident Presentation:**  The message implies the value of the product, subtly encouraging Bob to accept. 

This strategy aims to secure a sale above our minimum while acknowledging Bob's potential price sensitivity."
