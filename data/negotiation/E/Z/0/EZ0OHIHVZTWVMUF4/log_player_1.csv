Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'll aim to get as close to the maximum value of $1,000,000 as possible. Let's say I'll offer Bob the product for:

{""product_price"": $950,000}

This is a relatively high price, but it's still lower than the maximum value I'm willing to accept. Let's see how Bob responds!"
