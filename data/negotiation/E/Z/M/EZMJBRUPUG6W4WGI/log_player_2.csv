You should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, you can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I have to make sure I get a fair price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a great deal for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, you can still try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $105. That's a fair price, considering I'm your only potential buyer at the moment."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can see you're serious about getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $115, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, it's best to accept Alice's offer. While you'd prefer a lower price, you've already rejected her previous offer and there's a chance she might not budge further.  You're getting the product for a significantly lower price than John's offer, making it a good deal overall."
