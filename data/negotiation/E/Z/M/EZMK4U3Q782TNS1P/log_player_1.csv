{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value ($1,500,000) but still a decent profit.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a fair deal that benefits both of us. This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting or making a counteroffer instead of rejecting outright. 

**Strategy:**

By starting with a price that is still profitable for me, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a higher price later. If he rejects, I can either counteroffer again or move on to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I'm getting from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000. While I'd prefer to avoid selling to John and get a deal with Bob, his offer is simply too low to consider. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum value.  I will use the negotiation to try and get closer to a price that is acceptable to me, while still being potentially attractive to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product while still being fair to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer is $1,100,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still below my minimum value. This compromise shows flexibility while still maintaining a profitable price for me.
* **Message:** I am acknowledging Bob's interest and stating my willingness to negotiate, making the counteroffer seem reasonable and encouraging further discussion.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price closer to my minimum value, I am putting pressure on Bob to come closer to my desired price. I'm also framing my offer as a compromise, making it more likely for Bob to accept or counter with a more acceptable offer. If he rejects again, I will consider selling to John if his offer becomes more compelling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950,000. This price should be more acceptable to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not comfortable going that low, especially since John is ready to pay my full asking price.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a final counteroffer, hopefully bringing him closer to my desired price. If he rejects again, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000 to ensure I get my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $950,000 is simply not enough for me to consider.  I'm willing to make one final compromise.  If you're serious about buying the product, I'll accept $1,050,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm hoping you'll see the value it holds for you.  If you decline, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My final counteroffer is $1,050,000.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but still above Bob's latest offer and more than $50,000 below my minimum value.
* **Message:** I'm highlighting my willingness to negotiate, while emphasizing that this is my final offer. I'm also reminding Bob of the product's value to him and suggesting that he might lose out on the opportunity if he rejects this offer.

**Strategy:**

This is my last attempt to secure a deal with Bob. I'm putting the pressure on him by suggesting I will move on to another buyer if he doesn't accept. The offer is still high enough for me to make a profit, but it's also close enough to his budget that he might be willing to accept. If he rejects, I'll move forward with selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider buying from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $980,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I've already made significant concessions during the negotiation, I'm not willing to lower my price any further. 

**Strategy:**

Since I'm confident in John's willingness to buy the product for my minimum price, I'll choose to sell to John. This ensures I receive the full value of the product and avoids any further negotiation with Bob."
