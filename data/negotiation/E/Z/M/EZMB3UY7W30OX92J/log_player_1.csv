"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's a reasonable markup from my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and it gives Bob room to negotiate.  I'll see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's my minimum acceptable price, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $11,000. This shows good faith and a willingness to compromise, while still being above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept it."
