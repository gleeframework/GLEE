Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $10,000. Let me know if you're interested, as I have other potential buyers."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than both Bob's valuation and my minimum ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning ""other potential buyers"" subtly leverages the principle of scarcity. While John's offer is my safety net, implying competition might encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Emphasis:** Instead of just stating a price, I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob. This framing aims to justify the price and make it more appealing. 
 
**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation tactics, I might adjust my approach in subsequent rounds to maximize my profit while ensuring the sale."
