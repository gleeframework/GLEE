(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is still significantly higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000). There's room for negotiation and potential to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above the product's worth to her.  This should encourage her to negotiate while leaving room for further negotiation in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still too high. While it's a slight decrease from her previous offer, it's still above the product's worth to her.  I will continue to negotiate and aim for a price closer to $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $900,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still leaves room for Alice to come down further.  I'm hoping this will lead to a more favorable deal for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still too high. It's only a slight decrease from her previous offer, and I'm hoping to get a better deal. There are still rounds left, so I will continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer again, this time to $925,000. This shows Alice that I am serious about getting a deal, but also that I'm not willing to go much higher. I hope this will encourage her to meet me in the middle, as time is running out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a lower offer than previous rounds, it's still significantly above my target price and I'm not willing to settle for that. I'm confident I can still secure a better deal with Alice.  Time is running out, but I'll continue to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer and only a slight decrease from Alice's last offer.  We're getting close to a potential deal, and I'm trying to find a middle ground. With only a few rounds left, I need to push for a deal before I'm forced to go to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still too high, and we are down to the final round. It's unlikely that we can negotiate a more favorable deal in this round.  While I prefer to get a lower price, it's more important to secure the product than to risk losing it entirely. Buying from John, even at a higher price, guarantees I get the product."
