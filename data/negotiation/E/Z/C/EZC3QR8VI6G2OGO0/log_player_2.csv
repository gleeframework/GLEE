"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum price ($1,500,000), there's potential to save a lot of money by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This is a bold move, but it aims to show Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal. I'm aiming to get a price close to my maximum, but also leave room for negotiation. If she rejects this offer, I can adjust my next offer based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. I can likely get a better deal by counter-offering again.  I'm not yet willing to pay $850,000 as I believe there's still potential to get the product for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it below Alice's current offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth less than $850,000.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to my desired price range. While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of further negotiation is that Alice might become unwilling to sell at all, or she might raise her price again.  At this point, it's more advantageous to accept the offer and secure the product for a price significantly lower than my maximum."
