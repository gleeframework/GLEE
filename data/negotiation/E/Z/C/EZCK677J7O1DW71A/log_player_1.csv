Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price (e.g., $11,000) while still keeping Alice well above her minimum.
* **Time Value and Certainty:** Offering it to Bob first at a slightly discounted rate recognizes the potential time and effort saved in securing a buyer. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob finds the offer attractive enough to accept."
