"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $10,500, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a decent profit while still giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,750? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",10750.0,Bob,4,
