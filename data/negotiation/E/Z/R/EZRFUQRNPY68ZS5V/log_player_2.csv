"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but there's still room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob and $1,200,000 to Alice, there's a potential for a deal that benefits both parties.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This still leaves us both with a good profit margin. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still looking to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's still lower than what he's willing to pay from John ($1,500,000), and it's close to his initial counteroffer of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer ensures a good price for the product while avoiding further negotiation."
