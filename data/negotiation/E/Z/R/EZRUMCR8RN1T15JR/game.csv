"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
