,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $110? Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer! I understand that $110 is a bit lower than what I initially offered, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $125? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate further.  $125 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $115.  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit higher than your target price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $122. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle again and see if we can come to an agreement.",122.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm still not comfortable with $122. How about $118?  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your willingness to sell. Let's settle on this and finalize the deal.",118.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $119, but I think that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, I'm willing to make a deal at this price. If not, I'll have to consider selling the product to someone else.",119.0,Alice,7,
