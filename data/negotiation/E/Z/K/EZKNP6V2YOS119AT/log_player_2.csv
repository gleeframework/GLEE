"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $119, but I think that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, I'm willing to make a deal at this price. If not, I'll have to consider selling the product to someone else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer.  While $119 is still above your target price, it's getting very close.  There is a risk that if you continue to negotiate, Alice might decide to sell to someone else.  Given the potential risk of losing the product, accepting the offer is the best choice in this situation."
