{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum value.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob has room to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It shows you're serious:** You're not starting too low, indicating you value the product.

I'm going to keep in mind John's offer of $12,000 as a safety net. If Bob's counteroffers get too low, I'll be ready to move on!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is more than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than my initial asking price and my minimum value. 

I believe I can still get a better price by counter-offering.  The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, so there's still room for negotiation.  I'll see if I can bridge the gap and find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $11,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $13,000?  This would still be a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's try to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows good faith and signals my willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above my minimum:** $13,000 is still above my minimum value of $12,000, so I'm not losing out if he accepts.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, emphasizing that this is still a good deal. 

I'm hoping Bob sees the value in this offer and accepts. But if not, I'll have to carefully consider my next steps and keep John's offer in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $13,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum value.  While I'd prefer to earn a bit more, I've reached a point where further negotiation isn't likely to get me a significantly better price.  It's possible Bob could counteroffer again, but I don't want to risk prolonging the negotiation and losing out on a sure thing. 

John is a reliable buyer who is already willing to pay my minimum. Selling to John now guarantees me my desired profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
