"I'm interested in the product, but $1700000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1200000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1400000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair margin for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a new offer of $1000000. I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
