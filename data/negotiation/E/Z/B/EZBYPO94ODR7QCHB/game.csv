"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still not quite there.  How about $950,000?  It's closer to my ideal price and I think it's a fair offer for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you a price of $1,075,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can agree on this price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
