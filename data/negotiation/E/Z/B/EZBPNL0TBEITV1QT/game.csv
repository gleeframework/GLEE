"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $800000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $950000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll offer $900000 for the product. I think it's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $900000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $980000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",980000.0,Alice,5,
