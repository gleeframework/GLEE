"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a very competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm not sure I'll be able to offer it at a lower price than this.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle again at $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm still not willing to go below $900,000. I think this product is worth every penny, and I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margin too much. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, this product is valuable, and I do want to make a deal.  How about we split the difference one last time and land at $900,000 even?",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $900,000. I think we're getting close, but I need to maintain a decent profit margin. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and offer it to you for $915,000. This is my final offer.",915000.0,Alice,7,
