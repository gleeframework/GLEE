Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $900,000. I think we're getting close, but I need to maintain a decent profit margin. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and offer it to you for $915,000. This is my final offer.

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  We've reached a point where the potential savings from further negotiation are getting smaller. Each counteroffer is only moving the price by a relatively small amount.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk that Alice will hold firm at $915,000, and we'll end up having to buy from John at $1,200,000 anyway. Accepting now secures a significant discount.
* **Time:**  We've used up a good portion of our negotiation rounds.  Dragging it out further increases the chances of a stalemate.

Accepting the $915,000 offer represents a good balance between potential savings and the risk of losing the deal altogether."
