It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for a price that's sure to be mutually beneficial. I'm confident that this product will be a significant asset to your business. Let's discuss the specifics and find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1,400,000}

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The message is designed to pique Bob's interest, highlighting the value of the product to him and hinting at a potential win-win scenario. 
* **Product Price:** $1,400,000 is a reasonable price that offers a significant profit for Alice while still being attractive to Bob. It is a good starting point for negotiations, and Alice can adjust the price depending on Bob's response.

This approach aims to maximize Alice's profit while maintaining a good chance of Bob accepting the offer. It is important to remember that this is just a starting point, and the actual negotiation might involve further back and forth."
