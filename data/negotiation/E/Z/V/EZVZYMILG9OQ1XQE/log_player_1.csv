"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting high, at $13,000, knowing it's more than Bob values it. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows room for me to compromise without going below my minimum. I'm hoping he'll counter, giving us both room to reach a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum of $12,000. While I'm tempted by the $12,000 from John, I'm still optimistic about reaching a deal with Bob closer to my desired price. There are still 8 rounds left, and I can counter with a higher offer to see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $12,500. This is still above Bob's offer but closer to his valuation, showing flexibility while staying above my minimum. My hope is to meet halfway and secure a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum price of $12,000. It's a good deal for me, and I'm not sure I can get a better offer from him in the remaining rounds. Although I'm still tempted by the $12,000 from John, I'm deciding to accept Bob's offer and close the deal. This ensures I get my minimum price and avoids the risk of Bob rejecting any further counteroffers."
