Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a reasonable starting point that's higher than my minimum but allows for some negotiation space. I'm confident that the product is worth more than $8,000 to Bob, so I'm aiming to get a good price.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm countering with $9,800. This is a small compromise from my initial offer, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate while still keeping the price above my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, as it's a fair price considering the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely. I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product for $9,200. It's not my ideal price, but it's a good deal considering the risk of Bob walking away or me selling to John for a lower price."
