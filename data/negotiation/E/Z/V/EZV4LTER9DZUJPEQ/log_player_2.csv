"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $95 for it. This is a fair deal considering its worth to you is $80, and it's slightly above my cost price. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.
