Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $7,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.

While Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm going to push a little further and see if she'll go even lower. I'm still willing to walk away and buy from John if needed."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $7,125 is still a bit too low.  Let's try $7,187.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a final deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly committed to negotiating in small increments. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, the potential savings are getting smaller and smaller. Accepting this offer at $7,187.50 is a good deal and avoids the risk of the negotiation falling apart."
