"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below her own valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. By rejecting this offer, you can move forward with buying the product from John for a much better price of $800,000, saving you $300,000."
