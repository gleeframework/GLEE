"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its worth to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, considering the value this product brings to you. This price allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,000,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower. How about $950,000? That's a substantial offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
