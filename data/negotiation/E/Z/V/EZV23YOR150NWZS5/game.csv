,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if you're interested in this price.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $110. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $105.  If you're serious about selling, let's meet in the middle.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $105 isn't quite there yet. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $107.50. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll agree.",107.5,Alice,5,
