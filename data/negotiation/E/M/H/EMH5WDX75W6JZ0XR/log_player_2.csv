"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $12,000 to you, and I believe it's an excellent investment. Let's discuss how we can make this valuable asset yours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is tempting, but it's still above her perceived value of the product. As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested, $9,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  It's a fair price that provides value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'm glad we're having this conversation. Considering our mutual interests, how about we aim for a price closer to $9,500? This would still allow you to secure the product at a reasonable cost while ensuring a fair transaction for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,200 is within my budget and only slightly above her perceived value. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer, potentially leading to a higher price or a stalemate.  Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a good price without risking further rounds of negotiation."
