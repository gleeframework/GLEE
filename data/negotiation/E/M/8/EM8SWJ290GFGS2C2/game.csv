"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. It's a significant reduction from my initial offer and still gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000 for the product. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
