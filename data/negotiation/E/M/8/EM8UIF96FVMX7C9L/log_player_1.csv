I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  While it meets my minimum acceptable price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I will counter with a new offer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000. This is still a significant profit for me and a fair price considering the value of the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise and might tempt Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept, and I don't want to risk losing this deal by being too stubborn.  $1,100,000 is a good price, and I'll take it."
