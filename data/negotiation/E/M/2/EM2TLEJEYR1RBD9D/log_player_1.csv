"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This gives Bob a good deal while still leaving room for negotiation if necessary.  It's important to start high, as I can always lower the price later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I can try to get more. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my initial price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $135.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  Hopefully, this price will be agreeable to Bob, but if not, I can still adjust my price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  If things don't improve, I can always sell to John for my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125.  This is still above my minimum, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price. I'm hoping that this will be enough to close the deal with Bob, but if not, I can always sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me. I'm not willing to go below $120, so I'll sell the product to John."
