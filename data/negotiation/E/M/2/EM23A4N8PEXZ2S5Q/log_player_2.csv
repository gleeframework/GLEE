"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can likely get the product for a lower price by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  You know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's lower than Alice's offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate further if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if we can get closer to the $9,000 mark."

This counteroffer is a compromise - it's higher than your previous offer, but still lower than Alice's latest offer. This shows you're willing to negotiate but also that you're serious about getting the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Alice's offer is getting too close to John's price.  It's not worth risking further negotiation, as it's likely Alice will refuse to go lower. It's better to buy from John at this point."
