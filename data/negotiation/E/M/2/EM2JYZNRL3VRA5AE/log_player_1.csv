Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($80) and my minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""excellent value,"" I'm attempting to frame the price as justified, even though it's above Bob's perceived value.
* **Alternative:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer at $150. This gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Interest:** Bob's counteroffer, while below my initial ask, indicates he's definitely interested in the product. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** His offer is still significantly above his perceived value ($80), signaling willingness to negotiate further.
* **Backup Option:** I have the security of John's offer ($150), so I'm comfortable pushing for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $160?"", ""product_price"": 160}

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and making a concession to show I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Target Price:** I'm aiming for $160, which is a profitable price for me and still reasonably above Bob's perceived value.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** This framing technique suggests fairness and encourages Bob to make a similar move towards a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $160 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Offer:** Bob's offer of $140 is above my minimum acceptable price ($150) and provides a reasonable profit.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating strong interest.  His latest counteroffer is a fair compromise. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield a marginally better price. Accepting now secures the sale and avoids potential delays or the risk of Bob walking away."
