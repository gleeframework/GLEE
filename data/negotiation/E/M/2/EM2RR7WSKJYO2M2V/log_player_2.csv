(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget.** You are determined to pay no more than $8,000. 
* **You've reached a stalemate.**  Alice seems unwilling to budge further, and you've already made significant concessions. 
* **John offers a guaranteed price.** You can secure the product at your desired price by buying from John. 

It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John than to risk further negotiation with Alice and potentially lose out on the product altogether."
