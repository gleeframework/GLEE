"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know if you're open to negotiating further.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $10,500,  which still leaves some room for both of us to feel good about the deal. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
