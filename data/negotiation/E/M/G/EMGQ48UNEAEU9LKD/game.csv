"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I acknowledge the product's potential,  $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. This reflects its value to me while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,200,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,050,000? This would allow both of us to find a mutually agreeable price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
