"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the value, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you consider $12,000? That's a significant move on my part.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit too far off for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000.  This is a good compromise that considers both of our positions. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for meeting me halfway. While $14,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $12,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",12500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm firm on my minimum price of $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  I'm confident this is a good investment for you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  Let me know your decision.",14000.0,Alice,7,
