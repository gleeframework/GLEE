Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm firm on my minimum price of $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  I'm confident this is a good investment for you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is signaling she won't budge from $14,000.  While you could try negotiating further, you have a guaranteed option with John for $10,000. It's not worth the risk of Alice walking away and potentially losing the product altogether.  Saving $4,000 is significant in this scenario."
