Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, so he's willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  By offering the product at $140, you're leaving some room for negotiation (if Bob tries to haggle) but still aiming for a price close to his maximum valuation. This gives you the best chance of securing a higher profit than selling to John for $100."
