Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $150 to me, I'll try to get as close to that as possible. I'll offer Bob the product at a price of $120.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Since Bob's offer of $105 is lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($150), I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll make a counteroffer to try to get closer to my desired price.

I'll offer Bob the product at a price of $125.
