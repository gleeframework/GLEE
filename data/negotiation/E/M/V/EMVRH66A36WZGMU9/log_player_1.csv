"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my desired price. I'm confident I can get closer to my target in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I'm proposing $1,300,000 as a compromise. This is still well below the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,300,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,250,000 is getting closer to my target, it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget.  However, $1,250,000 doesn't quite cover the value I place on this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see something closer to $1,350,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a way to bridge this gap."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and it's a price that I believe reflects a fair value for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
