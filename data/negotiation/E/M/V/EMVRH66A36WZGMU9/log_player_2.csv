"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $1,500,000.  You have room to negotiate and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I'm proposing $1,300,000 as a compromise. This is still well below the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to your target, but still a bit higher.  There's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. You're willing to pay more than your goal of $1,500,000 but you can still try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,300,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget.  However, $1,250,000 doesn't quite cover the value I place on this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see something closer to $1,350,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a way to bridge this gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above your target price of $1,500,000. However,  it's getting closer. With a few more rounds, you might be able to negotiate a lower price. Buying from John at this point would be more expensive and it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and it's a price that I believe reflects a fair value for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
