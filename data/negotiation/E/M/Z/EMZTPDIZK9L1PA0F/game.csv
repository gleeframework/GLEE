,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $115?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a great price for such a valuable product, and I believe it's fair for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested but $125 is still a bit too high. How about we split the difference and I pay $120?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
