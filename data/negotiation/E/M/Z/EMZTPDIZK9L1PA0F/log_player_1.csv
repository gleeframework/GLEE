{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but not too much higher to discourage him from negotiating.  This will give me room to negotiate if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $115?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $120. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a great price for such a valuable product, and I believe it's fair for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested but $125 is still a bit too high. How about we split the difference and I pay $120?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum price. Since I can sell to John for the same price, there's no benefit to continuing to negotiate. I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him."
