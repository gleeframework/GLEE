"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $100 for it. This offer is exclusive to you and reflects the product's worth to you personally. Thank you for considering this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $100, while John is asking for $120. 
* **The product is worth more to Bob than to Alice:**  Bob values the product at $120, while Alice values it at $80. This means Bob is willing to pay more for the product than Alice is willing to sell it for. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option for Bob, as it allows him to get the product at a lower price than he would have to pay from John."
