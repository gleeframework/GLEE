"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000. Would that be something you'd consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $11,000? That's a fair offer considering my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can sell the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my own minimum requirements.",13000.0,Alice,5,
