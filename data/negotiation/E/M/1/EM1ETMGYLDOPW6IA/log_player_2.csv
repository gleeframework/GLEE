"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. I know it's worth $120 to me, but I'm willing to make you a great deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is lower than her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  You should always aim for the best possible price."
