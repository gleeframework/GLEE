"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks great, that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the benefits it will bring to your business. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest,  $1,100,000 is still a little too high for my budget.  How about $900,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a final offer, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
