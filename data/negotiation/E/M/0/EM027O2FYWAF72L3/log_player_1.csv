``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  $9,000 is well below my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm counteroffering with $12,000. This is my absolute minimum price, and I'm hoping Bob will understand that I'm serious about getting at least this much for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle for that price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counteroffer with $11,000. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, showing flexibility. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still being significantly higher than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's clear Bob is not willing to meet my price expectations. While $10,500 is better than his previous offer, it's still not enough for me. I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. It's not ideal, but it's a secure deal and it meets my minimum value."
