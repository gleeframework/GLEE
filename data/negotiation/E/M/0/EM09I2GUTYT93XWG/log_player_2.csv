Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the product's value is considerably higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $700,000 is still below my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This is my final offer.

Alice has met your upper limit. There's no point in rejecting and counter offering again, as you can buy from John for the same price."
