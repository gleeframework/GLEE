"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, which is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the ""worth much more"" aspect subtly emphasizes the potential benefit for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$85 is too low:** While it's closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still below my minimum of $120. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room to find a price that benefits both of us.
* **Potential to Get Closer:** Rejecting allows me to send a counteroffer, potentially finding a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. Let's meet in the middle, it's a fair price for a quality product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's quality to justify the price.
* **Compromise:**  By suggesting a ""middle ground,"" I'm emphasizing a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $90 is still below my minimum price of $120. 
* **Room for One More Move:**  There's still room to negotiate, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is tempting, I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob first, as I might still be able to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $92.50 as a final compromise. This allows me to make a fair profit and you to get a great product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm making a smaller move this time, demonstrating that I'm nearing my limit. 
* **Focus on Both Sides:**  I emphasize the benefits for both of us to create a sense of shared gain. 
* **Finality:**  The ""final compromise"" phrasing creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept."
