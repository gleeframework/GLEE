"Hi Alice,  $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. Let's meet in the middle, it's a fair price for a quality product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $92.50 as a final compromise. This allows me to make a fair profit and you to get a great product. Let's close this deal.",92.5,Alice,5,
