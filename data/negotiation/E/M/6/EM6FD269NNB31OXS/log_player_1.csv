"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for a starting price of $200. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal!"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. I am willing to pay $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I have a guaranteed offer from John for $150, which meets my minimum price.  There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and I risk getting less if I continue negotiating."
