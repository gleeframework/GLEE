{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $12,000 to me, and Bob is only offering $7,000.  I'm not willing to accept such a low offer. I'll see if I can get a better deal from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $8,500? That's still a great price for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $8000. How about we meet in the middle at $8250? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer to sell to John for $12,000, Bob's offer of $8,250 is getting closer to my value of $12,000. There are only 6 rounds left, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether. Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and avoids the potential of getting a lower counteroffer in the next round."
