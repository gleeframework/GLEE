Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. He'll only accept offers below that.
* **The Sweet Spot:**  You need to find a price that's appealing to Bob but also nets you a profit beyond John's offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a significant asset to you. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting exclusivity adds perceived value and urgency.
* **Confidence:**  Projecting confidence in your product's value can influence Bob's perception.
* **High but Reasonable:** $950,000 is significantly above John's offer, giving you room to negotiate while staying above your minimum. 
* **Time Limit:**  Creating a sense of urgency can push Bob to make a decision.

**Important Considerations**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You have room to go down slightly, but remember your minimum.
* **Relationship:**  While getting the best price is important, consider if a long-term relationship with Bob is valuable. This might influence your willingness to negotiate further."
