"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:  While $120 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  It's worth trying to lower the price further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product. However, $120 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

Reasoning:  Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still above his maximum budget. This is a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  If she rejects, there's still room for further negotiation before Bob has to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking for a good price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reasoning:  While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still above his ideal price.  There's still room for negotiation.  Bob can try to push for a lower price, as Alice has already demonstrated a willingness to negotiate.  If he rejects, there's a chance Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $115 is closer, but I'm still a bit over budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $110? That's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

Reasoning: Bob is trying to find a price that's a middle ground between his ideal price and Alice's latest offer. This demonstrates that he's still interested in buying the product but wants to ensure he gets the best possible deal. By suggesting a split, he's making the counteroffer more appealing while still maintaining his position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I can sell it to you for $112.50. That's the best I can do, considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Reasoning:  Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, but it's still a bit more than he's comfortable paying.  At this point, it's better for Bob to cut his losses and buy from John.  Continuing to negotiate may lead to further concessions from Alice, but there's no guarantee she'll reach Bob's ideal price, and the risk of running out of rounds before getting a suitable offer from Alice is too high.  It's better to secure the product from John at his guaranteed price."
