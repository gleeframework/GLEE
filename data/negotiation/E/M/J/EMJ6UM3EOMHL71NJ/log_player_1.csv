Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your latest offer. I am still willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable solution.

Bob seems stuck on $1,500,000. I'm not willing to go that low yet.  Let's see if he's willing to budge a little in the next round."

Bob is clearly anchored at $1,500,000 and doesn't seem likely to budge. While it's not ideal to go so far below my initial ask,  $1,500,000 is still a significant profit and better than risking a deal with John if negotiations drag on.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the deal."
