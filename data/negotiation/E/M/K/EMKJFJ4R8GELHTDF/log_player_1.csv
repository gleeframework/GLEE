Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that you value the product highly. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you a sense of his eagerness and potential for negotiation. 
* **Safety Net:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000. This knowledge allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob.

**Important Note:**  This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or expresses hesitation."
