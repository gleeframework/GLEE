We're getting close, and Alice is clearly willing to move.  However, I think there's still room to push a little further down before taking her final offer or going with John."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the continued movement.  To be frank, I'm getting close to taking another offer, but I'd rather make this work with you.  My final offer is $690,000."",
""product_price"": 690000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This message makes it clear that this is my best and final offer.  
* **Alternative Option:** Mentioning another offer adds a bit of pressure without being overly aggressive.
* **Seeking Agreement:**  I'm ending on a note that still emphasizes wanting to find a deal with Alice. 

This puts the ball back in Alice's court. She can accept the favorable price or risk losing the sale entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We appreciate your persistence, Bob. After careful consideration, we've decided to move forward with a final offer of $710,000 for the product. This represents a compromise that respects both our valuation and your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $710,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $710,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** While not ideal, $710,000 is a reasonable compromise. I'm saving $90,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Finality:**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  Trying to push further risks losing the deal entirely.
* **Time:** We're in the penultimate round. I'd rather secure the deal now than risk running out of time and having to go with John's offer by default."
