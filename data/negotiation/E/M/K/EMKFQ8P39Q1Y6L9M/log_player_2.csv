"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's significantly closer to your maximum budget than her likely minimum.  
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds, and even if you need to go through a few rounds, you'll still be able to save money compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above her minimum value, suggesting a willingness to compromise.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  This initial offer is a starting point for negotiation, and you still have 9 rounds to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good compromise.**  It's significantly lower than her initial offer, and it's within your budget. 
* **There's little to gain by continuing to negotiate.**  While you could try to get a slightly lower price, the risk of her rejecting your offer and needing to go through more rounds is high. You have already made progress in the negotiations, and accepting this offer is a good way to secure the product within a reasonable price."
