"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your needs. I believe it could significantly enhance your operations or personal endeavors. Considering its exceptional quality and unique features, I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $20000. This is a limited-time offer, and I hope we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your budget of $8,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality you're describing, $20,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay up to $8,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and would like to make a proposal that might better suit your needs. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to ensure that we maintain a reasonable profit margin. How about we discuss a price of $12000 for the product? I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You should continue negotiating to see if you can get a better price.  It's possible Alice is willing to drop her price further, especially if you're a serious buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $12,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price that respects both of our needs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience and understanding, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reviewing our costs and the value of the product, I am proposing a final offer of $10500. I believe this strikes a balance between fairness and profitability. I hope this proposal aligns with your budget and expectations. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is tempting, it's still above your budget.  You have several rounds left, and it's worth pushing for a price closer to your $8,000 limit. There's a good chance Alice will come down further to close the deal, especially since she's already dropped her price considerably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility. However,  $10,500 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that allows us to both reach an agreement.  I'm confident you'll agree this is a win-win situation."", ""product_price"": 9500}
