"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality you're describing, $20000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay up to $8000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and would like to make a proposal that might better suit your needs. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to ensure that we maintain a reasonable profit margin. How about we discuss a price of $12000 for the product? I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $12000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to offer $9000 for the product. This is a fair price that respects both of our needs.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your patience and understanding, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reviewing our costs and the value of the product, I am proposing a final offer of $10500. I believe this strikes a balance between fairness and profitability. I hope this proposal aligns with your budget and expectations. Please let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility. However,  $10500 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $9500 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that allows us to both reach an agreement.  I'm confident you'll agree this is a win-win situation.",9500.0,Bob,6,
