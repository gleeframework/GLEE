Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and it's well worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the price at $175, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I've framed the offer as a positive one, highlighting the value and emphasizing the potential for a good deal. 

This approach aims to:

* **Start the negotiation strong:**  By offering a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, I signal that I'm confident in the product's worth.
* **Leave room for compromise:** The price is not too far off from Bob's value, allowing for a potential agreement.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:** If Bob rejects my offer, I still have the backup option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price that's closer to my desired value. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer, giving me more control over the negotiation. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can maintain leverage and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $140?  I think this price reflects the value of the product while also being fair for you."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I've proposed $140, which is the average of my initial offer ($175) and Bob's counteroffer ($120). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and potentially reach an agreement.
* **Highlighting value:**  I've re-emphasized the value of the product to further justify the price.
* **Maintain leverage:**  While offering a lower price, I haven't dropped below my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I still get a profitable deal.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** Indicate that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Keep the conversation going:** Avoid a stalemate and encourage Bob to consider the counteroffer.
* **Maintain a strong position:** Still allows me to walk away and sell to John if Bob continues to reject my offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still aiming to keep my spending within my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $130 is only $20 below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Risk of losing a deal:** If I reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate, there's a risk that he might walk away entirely, leaving me with only the option of selling to John for $150. 
* **Time factor:**  Continuing the negotiation could drag out the process and might not necessarily lead to a significantly better price.

While $130 is not my ideal price, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision in this scenario. It guarantees a sale, secures a price close to my minimum, and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
