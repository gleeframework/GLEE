""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product.  Its value is significant, and I believe it can be transformative for you. To kick things off, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000.  This reflects its true worth and potential."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While meeting halfway might seem fair, it significantly undervalues the product. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. However,  $900,000 is significantly below its true worth and potential.  To move us closer, I'm proposing $1,500,000. This reflects a more accurate valuation while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product has significant value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise and propose a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is now getting closer to a reasonable price.  However, I believe I can still push for a higher amount before accepting or going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value of this product, and I respect your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a point we're both comfortable with. I propose $1,350,000.  It's a strong offer reflecting the value while acknowledging your engagement in this process."",
""product_price"": 1350000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,250,000 provides a significant profit above my minimum, and it's better to secure the deal now than risk further negotiation."
