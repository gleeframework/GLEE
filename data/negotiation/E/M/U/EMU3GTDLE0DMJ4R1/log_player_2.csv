"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my minimum price and still leaves you room for profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her minimum price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and see if you can get closer to your desired price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.
