"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This price is fair considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
