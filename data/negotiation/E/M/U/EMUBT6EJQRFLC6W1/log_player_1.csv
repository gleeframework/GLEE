Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I want to see if Bob will pay a price closer to my valuation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a profit above my minimum.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering a price slightly below my guaranteed sale price might make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal and encourage him to accept."
