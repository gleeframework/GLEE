"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm afraid $1200000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer you a price of $1400000, which is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
