"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,500?  It's a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $8,200 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,300. It's a fair compromise that's closer to my bottom line. Let's get this deal done!",8300.0,Alice,5,
