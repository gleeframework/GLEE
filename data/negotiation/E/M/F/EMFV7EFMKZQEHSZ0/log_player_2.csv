"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it to be a valuable addition to your collection. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $1,100,000 is still above his target of $1,200,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** Alice is willing to sell for at least $1,000,000, so there's a potential for a price that works for both parties.
* **It's early in the negotiation.** There are 9 more rounds, so Bob has time to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** While it's a step in the right direction,  $1,050,000 is still above Bob's target of $1,200,000.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Alice is willing to come down from her initial offer, which means there's more wiggle room.
* **There are still 7 rounds left.**  Bob has time to continue to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $950,000. It's a fair price for the product, and I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. I believe this is a reasonable price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget.** While $1,025,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than his maximum price.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Alice has shown a willingness to come down, indicating that she's open to further compromise.
* **There are still 5 rounds left.**  Bob has more time to explore if he can get a lower price, and it's still better than buying from John at $1,200,000."

* **Negotiation is still possible.** Alice has shown flexibility and a willingness to compromise, indicating that there's still room for a lower price.
