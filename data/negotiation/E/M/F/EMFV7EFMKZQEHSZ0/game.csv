"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it to be a valuable addition to your collection. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $950,000. It's a fair price for the product, and I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. I believe this is a reasonable price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this.",975000.0,Bob,6,
