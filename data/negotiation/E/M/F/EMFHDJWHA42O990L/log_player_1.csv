"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive messaging:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By starting high, I allow myself space to potentially lower the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for better negotiation:** I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob.  
* **Selling to John is a backup:** While John offers a guaranteed $150, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  That's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's a compromise between my original price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still protects my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive messaging:** I reiterate my belief in the product's value and emphasize the mutual benefit of the proposed price. 
* **Leaving room for final negotiation:** While $140 is my current limit, I'm open to discussing further adjustments depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, $125 is still below my target.
* **Potential for better deal:**  I'm confident I can still get a higher price from Bob with further negotiation.
* **Time is running out:** While selling to John guarantees $150, I have only a few rounds left and want to maximize my potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  Let's split the difference.  I'll accept $135 for the product.  It's a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's directly between my last offer ($140) and Bob's offer ($125), demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Finality:** The message emphasizes the benefit of closing the deal at this price, making it clear this is a potential final offer.
* **Time pressure:** While I'm not explicitly mentioning the limited rounds, the message subtly suggests it's time to come to an agreement.

I'm aiming for a compromise that's closer to my target than John's offer, but I'm also acknowledging the need to be flexible to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Bob's offer of $130 is very close to my target price of $135.
* **Limited rounds:**  We're approaching the halfway point of our negotiation rounds, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price.
* **Risk vs. reward:** While I could try to push for $135, the risk of further rejection and running out of time outweighs the potential gain. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale close to my target price.
* **John's offer as backup:** Even if I don't get a better price, John's guaranteed $150 provides a safety net. 

In this situation, it's more prudent to secure a sale at a slightly lower price than risk losing the deal entirely and being forced to sell to John at a lower profit."
