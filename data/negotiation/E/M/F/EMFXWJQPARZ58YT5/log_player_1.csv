Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This is a good starting point for negotiation. I'm also trying to be friendly and open to discussion, hoping to build a positive rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? This would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
