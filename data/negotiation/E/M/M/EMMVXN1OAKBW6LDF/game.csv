"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its potential value. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1750000? This would still allow you to realize significant value from the product while ensuring I receive a fair price.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1750000 is still above my budget. I'm confident this product holds great value, but I'm only able to offer $1250000 at this time. This price is still a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
