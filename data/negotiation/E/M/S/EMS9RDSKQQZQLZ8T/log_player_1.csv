{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a decent profit.
* **Message:** I'm friendly and positive, emphasizing the value of the product and the deal. This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider my offer seriously. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum price and John's offer of $15,000.  I'll aim to secure the highest possible price while being flexible enough to make a deal.
* If negotiations stall or don't lead to a satisfactory outcome, I'll always have the option of selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** While I'm open to negotiation, I'm confident I can get a better price than $10,000, especially considering John's offer of $15,000.
* **Strategic rejection:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially increase the final price. It also demonstrates that I'm serious about getting a fair price for the product.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, aiming for a compromise that allows both of us to feel satisfied with the deal. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a backup option."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a great price for a product worth so much, and it leaves room for both of us to feel good about the deal. Let's make this happen! "", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm offering $11,500, which is halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000.  This shows flexibility while still holding onto a decent profit margin.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a positive tone, reminding Bob of the product's value and the potential for a win-win situation. I'm emphasizing the fairness of my counteroffer to encourage acceptance. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good outcome.
* If Bob rejects, I'll carefully consider his next offer, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still unable to meet at $11,500. I would like to propose $10,500 as my final offer. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I am aiming to earn more than $10,500.
* **Strategic rejection:**  Rejecting Bob's offer demonstrates my resolve to get a better deal. It also opens the door for a final counteroffer where I can try to bridge the gap.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I know that John is willing to pay $15,000, so I'm not in a rush to accept a low offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $11,500. This will demonstrate my willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. If Bob still refuses, I will proceed to sell to John for $15,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference?  I'll offer you the product for $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $11,000, which is right in the middle of Bob's last offer of $10,500 and my previous offer of $11,500. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing fairness and a win-win scenario. I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by suggesting that this is a good opportunity for both of us to finalize the deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've secured a decent price and closed the deal.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll have to carefully weigh my options:
    * If Bob's rejection seems like a final stance, I'll move forward with selling to John for $15,000.
    * If there's still room for negotiation, I'll consider a final counteroffer, but I'll be more cautious about making concessions."
