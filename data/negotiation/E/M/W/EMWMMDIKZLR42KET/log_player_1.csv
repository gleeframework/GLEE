"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counter without immediately triggering a rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell for such a loss.
* **More Negotiation is Possible:** I have 9 rounds left, and I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, especially since he expressed interest. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is attractive, I'm not yet at a point where I'm desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $9,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but I'm still staying above my minimum.
* **Highlight Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to emphasize that $11,000 is a good deal. 
* **Focus on Win-Win:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""good deal"" for both of us, encouraging a positive response.
* **Room for Adjustment:** I'm still leaving room for Bob to counter if he's not satisfied with this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the discount, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,200 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for Compromise:**  While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I still have room to negotiate.  I'm confident I can get a better deal.
* **John's Offer:** I'm still not at a point where I feel desperate to sell, so John's offer is not immediately compelling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $10,750.  This is a fair price that takes into account both the value of the product and your budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still holding out for a higher price.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price, suggesting a balanced outcome.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Last Chance:** This is getting close to my minimum; I'm ready to consider selling to John if Bob doesn't budge much further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Close Enough:**  While $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a significant loss compared to what I could get from John.
* **Negotiation Power:** I still have 4 rounds left, and Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate. There's a good chance I can push for a higher price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John guarantees a profit of $15,000, but there's still the potential for a better deal with Bob. It's worth taking the risk of a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting very close.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $10,625.  This is a fair price that's a good compromise for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10625}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This strategy shows a willingness to compromise while still getting a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Fairness Appeal:** Emphasizing ""fairness"" and ""compromise"" strengthens the appeal of the offer.
* **Urgency Implied:**  By saying ""we're getting very close,"" I'm subtly suggesting that this might be the final offer.
* **Balancing Risk:**  I'm still willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a better deal, but I'm also showing that I'm serious about closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Running Out:** With only two rounds left, the negotiation is taking longer than expected. 
* **Low Offer:**  Bob's offer of $10,000 is too low for me, and there's no guarantee that I can get a better price in the next round.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $15,000, which is more than I can expect from Bob at this point. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of a few extra dollars from Bob is not worth the risk of ending up with a lower price or no deal at all."
