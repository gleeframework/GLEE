"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's something that could significantly benefit your business, and I'm confident it's worth at least $1.5 million to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows for a substantial profit for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, while John is asking for $1,500,000.
* **You still save a significant amount.** Even though Alice's price is higher than her own value ($800,000), it's still lower than your maximum budget ($1,500,000) and your perceived value ($1,500,000)."
