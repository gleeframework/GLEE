"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's something that could significantly benefit your business, and I'm confident it's worth at least $1.5 million to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows for a substantial profit for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
