"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I know its value is significant, and I'm confident it will be a great asset to your business. My initial offer is $1,400,000. This price reflects the product's exceptional quality and potential for growth. I'm open to discussing further, but I believe this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her, but it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This price reflects a fair value for both of us, and I'm confident it's a price we can agree on."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand you're looking for a fair deal. However, $1,300,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my original offer. How about $1,350,000? This price still allows for a good profit margin for both of us, and I believe it reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's desired price but closer.  Bob should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a lower price. He has the advantage of a lower price from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows you a decent profit while staying within my budget.  I'm confident this offer represents a win-win situation for us both."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
