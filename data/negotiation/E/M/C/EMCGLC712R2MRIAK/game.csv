"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This price reflects a fair value for both of us, and I'm confident it's a price we can agree on.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand you're looking for a fair deal. However, $1,300,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my original offer. How about $1,350,000? This price still allows for a good profit margin for both of us, and I believe it reflects the product's true value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows you a decent profit while staying within my budget.  I'm confident this offer represents a win-win situation for us both.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
