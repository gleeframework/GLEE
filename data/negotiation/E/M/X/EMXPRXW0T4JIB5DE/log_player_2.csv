"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. Since you know you can buy the product from John for the same price, there's no downside to negotiating with Alice.  You might be able to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  A $5,000 drop is substantial and will show Alice that I'm serious about getting a lower price. If she rejects this, it gives me information about her bottom line and allows me to adjust my subsequent counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but there's still room for negotiation.  I'm not going to accept a price that's only $3,000 below my ""fallback"" price with John. It's worth seeing if I can get Alice lower than $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate. I'm going to inch up my offer, but only by a small amount ($1,000). This signals that I'm still trying to get a good deal but am also demonstrating that I'm serious about buying from her.  This allows me to gauge her willingness to come down further without closing the door on a potential agreement."
