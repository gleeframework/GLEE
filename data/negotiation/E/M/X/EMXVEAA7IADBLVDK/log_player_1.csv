{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a truly unique item, and I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I've chosen $20,000 as my initial offer, which is significantly higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. The message is friendly and highlights the value of the product. 

It's important to remember that this is just the first step.  I'll need to be prepared to adjust my offer based on Bob's response, and I'll always have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested, but I can only offer $12000 right now. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm not willing to accept such a low price, so I will reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me to consider.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm happy to offer you the product for $17,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial price, and it still allows me to cover my costs.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my original price. It demonstrates flexibility and shows I'm willing to negotiate to reach a deal.  The message is still positive and encouraging, highlighting the discount to make the offer more attractive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $17000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15000. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to look elsewhere. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price. I'm happy to accept this offer and sell the product to Bob."
