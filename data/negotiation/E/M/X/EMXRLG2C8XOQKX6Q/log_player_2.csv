"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's worth $1500000, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let's start with a price of $1750000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,750,000 is above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1400000 is unfortunately too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $1600000 would be the minimum I can accept at this point. Let's keep the discussion going and see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price. Bob can continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price. He has 7 rounds remaining and still has the option to buy from John for $1,500,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. This would allow both of us to have a successful deal."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
