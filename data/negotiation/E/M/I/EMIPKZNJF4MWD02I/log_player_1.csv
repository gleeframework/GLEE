Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking to a price well below my minimum. While I could continue negotiating, there's a real risk he won't budge much higher than his current offer. Selling to John guarantees the $10,000, which is better than potentially getting stuck with a lower offer from Bob after further rounds."
