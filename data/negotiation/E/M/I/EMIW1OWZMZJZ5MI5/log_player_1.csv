{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I've done some research and I'm not sure it's worth the full $14000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth at least $12,000 to me.  While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell below that amount.  I'll counteroffer and see if I can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $11,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for the value I'm offering.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12500. I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is above my minimum price of $12,000 and it's a good compromise.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
