"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $800000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking for a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800000 and $900000. How about $850000?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really serious about buying this product, and I think $825000 is a fair price that reflects both our needs. What do you say?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your seriousness about buying the product. However, I'm still not willing to go below $875000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm willing to meet you at this price. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
