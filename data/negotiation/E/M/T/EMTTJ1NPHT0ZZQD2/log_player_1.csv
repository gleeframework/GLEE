"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to come down from my initial asking price."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial asking price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to my minimum asking price. How about $1,350,000? This still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1300000? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I'll try to push for a slightly higher offer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,325,000? This would allow me to meet my minimum and still give you a good deal. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1325000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1310000, but that's as low as I can go. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,310,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,310,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to reach $1,325,000, accepting Bob's offer of $1,310,000 is a good compromise.  It's only $15,000 away from my target, and I'm concerned that if I reject this offer and continue negotiating, I might lose Bob as a buyer and be forced to sell to John at a lower price.  Therefore, accepting this offer seems like the best option at this stage."
