"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the potential of this product, $800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $700000. This price still reflects its value to me, but I'm open to negotiations and believe it's a fair price considering the benefits it can bring to your business.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $700000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $650000 for the product. This reflects a genuine commitment to acquiring it while remaining within my financial constraints. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,4,
