"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you reaching out.  However, $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  Would you be willing to consider $12500?  I'm really interested in the product, and this is the highest I can go right now.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $13750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,3,
