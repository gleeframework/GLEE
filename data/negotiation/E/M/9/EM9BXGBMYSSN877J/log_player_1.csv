Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $110. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$110 price:** This is a starting point higher than Bob's perceived value, but not exorbitantly high to scare him off.

* **Goal:**  To gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate upward."

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  While $95 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'd like to get.  
* **Reasoning:**  I believe I can still potentially negotiate a better price with Bob. There are 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can secure a price closer to my target. 
* **Strategy:** By rejecting his offer, I show I'm firm in my pricing and encourage Bob to consider going higher in the next round."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm lowering my price to $105, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
