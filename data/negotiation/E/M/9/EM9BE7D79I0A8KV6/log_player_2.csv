You should reject Alice's offer.  $2,000,000 is above your maximum budget. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John for a cheaper price."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price and within my budget. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject her offer again and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It's still within my budget and hopefully, Alice will see this as a fair price."

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above my budget. I'm not sure if we'll be able to come to an agreement. At this point, it's better to buy from John and save myself the hassle of further negotiation."
