Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a good starting point for negotiations.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter with a lower price, keeping in mind that I'll accept nothing less than $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's far below my minimum acceptable value. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000, a significant drop from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still maintaining a price that is acceptable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value, and I'm not yet ready to settle for that price.  I'll counter with a price closer to $1,500,000, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."

I'm lowering my price again to $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob. I'm still confident that I can get a better price than John's offer, and I believe that Bob is likely to accept this price."
