Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth around $8,000 to me, so I could go as high as $6,000 to leave some room for negotiation.  Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $6,000 is far too low for me. This product is high-quality and in high demand, I could easily sell it for much more. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $14,000 is still  above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000.  Let me know if that's something you can consider."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product is truly worth the value I'm placing on it.  If we can agree on $12,000, I'm happy to close the deal today. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $9,000? That's a considerable increase from my previous offer and would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we are getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,000 is still too low. Let's make this final push and settle at $10,500. This offer stands for this round only, as I do have other potential buyers interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, her price reductions are still too slow.  Her latest offer of $10,500 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $8,000. There's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, especially with other potential buyers. Accepting John's offer ensures you get the product at the best possible price for you."
