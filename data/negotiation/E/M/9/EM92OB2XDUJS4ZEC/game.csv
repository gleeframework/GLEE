"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us – you get a valuable product for a fair price, and I get a good return on my investment.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? This would ensure both of us get a good deal. Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. Can you consider this revised counteroffer?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $925,000 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Let's compromise again – how about $940,000? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",940000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $940,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $920,000. Can you consider this revised counteroffer?",920000.0,Bob,6,
