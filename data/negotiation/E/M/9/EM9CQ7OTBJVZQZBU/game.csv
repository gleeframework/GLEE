"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to me is $8,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
