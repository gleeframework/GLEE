"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is within his budget, it's still more than the product's value to Alice ($1,000,000).  There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $1,200,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying, but also willing to negotiate. This move puts pressure on Alice to either accept or counter with a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for a lower price. While $1,350,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it is still significantly higher than what Bob believes the product is worth. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try for an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a compromise. He's already offered $1,200,000 and Alice countered with $1,350,000. This counteroffer of $1,250,000 splits the difference and shows a willingness to meet halfway. This might be the tipping point for Alice to accept, especially if she wants to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, he's still hoping for a better deal. He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, and with several rounds left, he can still try to push for a lower price. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to explore further options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to Alice's price but still holding firm on getting a lower price.  The counteroffer of $1,275,000 is a small increase from his last offer, showing flexibility but still holding his ground. This might convince Alice to accept, especially if she feels the price is close to her minimum acceptable point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has consistently countered with a price that's only slightly higher than Bob's counteroffers.  This suggests that they're close to an agreement.  While $1,325,000 isn't Bob's ideal price, it's significantly lower than the initial offer and still within his budget.  With only three rounds left, the risk of continuing the negotiation is high.  If Bob rejects this offer, there's a chance he might not get a better deal, and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Therefore, accepting this offer is the most sensible option, securing the product at a reasonable price within the remaining rounds."
