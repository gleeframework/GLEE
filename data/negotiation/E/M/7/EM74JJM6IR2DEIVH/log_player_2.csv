"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to both of us. Let's make this transaction smooth and beneficial for both parties. Would you like to purchase it for $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. While $110 is a good deal, you can potentially get it for even cheaper by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. While $110 is tempting, I'm looking for a slightly better price. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. However, I need to maintain a minimum profit margin. How about we agree on $107 for the product? This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while remaining competitive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $107, which is a significant reduction from her initial offer of $110. This is closer to your target price of $105. Accepting this offer allows you to get the product at a decent price while still saving $13 compared to buying from John.  The potential savings from further negotiation might not be worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
