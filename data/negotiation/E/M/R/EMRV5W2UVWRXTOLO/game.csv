"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to get closer to $850,000. I believe this price is fair for both of us, given the value of the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  Let's split the difference and go with $950,000.  This price would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price, considering the value of the product to you.",975000.0,Alice,7,
