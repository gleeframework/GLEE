Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  A $50,000 reduction from Alice's offer is a significant step, but it's still within a reasonable range.
* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. If she rejects, you'll have a better understanding of her bottom line.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Alice's response.** If she rejects, be ready to counter again with a slightly higher price, but still keep your goal of $800,000 in mind. 
* **Remember the alternative:**  You have the option to buy from John for $800,000 at any point, which should influence your negotiation strategy."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Next Steps:**

You should counter again, aiming for a price closer to $750,000.  Remember, you have the option of buying from John for $800,000, so you're not under any pressure to accept a deal that's not in your best interest."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and show good faith:**  This counteroffer is a middle ground between Alice's last offer and your previous one, demonstrating you're serious about reaching a deal.
* **Pressure point:** It's close enough to Alice's offer to make her consider accepting, but still leaves room for a slight counteroffer from her if needed.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Alice's response.** If she rejects, be ready to counter again with a slight increase, but remember you have the $800,000 option from John as a fallback.
* **Don't get too aggressive:** While you want to save money, pushing for a deal too far below your target could risk losing the deal altogether."

* **Be prepared for a potential stalemate:**  It's possible that Alice might be unwilling to go lower. If that happens, you might need to consider buying from John if you're reaching the end of your rounds."
