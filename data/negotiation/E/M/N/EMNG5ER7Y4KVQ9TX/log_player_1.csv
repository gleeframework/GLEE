Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000,  aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 is a strong offer. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but offers him a substantial discount compared to John's offer. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By mentioning other interested parties and framing it as a limited-time offer, we create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision."
