Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your bottom line:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so that's the absolute minimum you'll accept.
* **Aiming high:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) is a strategic move. It leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly mention the product's worth to Bob, it subtly implies a higher value by using phrases like ""significant value"" and ""worthwhile investment.""

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's perspective:** Bob might outright reject this offer as it's significantly higher than his valuation. 
* **Negotiation:** This initial offer sets the stage for potential counter-offers from Bob. Be prepared to negotiate, but always keep your $15,000 safety net in mind."
