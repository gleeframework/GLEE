"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise at $11,250. This allows for a fair price for both of us, and hopefully we can finalize the deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,
