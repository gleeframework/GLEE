"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way out of my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $5,000 for the product. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. I can meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is my best offer for now.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet somewhere around $7,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer for now.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm really trying to make this work.  I can offer you $7,500 for the product. That's a significant amount, and I think it's a fair compromise considering your last offer.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. I can see that you're making a genuine effort to meet me in the middle. I'm willing to consider your last offer, but I need to think about it. Let me counter with a price of $10,000. This is a compromise, but it's still a significant discount from my original price.",10000.0,Alice,7,
