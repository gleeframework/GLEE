"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great investment. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Even though Alice's offer is a discount, you know you can get the product for $800,000 from John.  There's no reason to pay more than your fallback option."
