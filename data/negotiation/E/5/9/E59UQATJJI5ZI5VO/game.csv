"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? That's a fair offer considering the current market.",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7,250 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $8,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can make this deal work.",8000.0,Alice,5,
