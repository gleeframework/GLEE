Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to our target price, $8,500 is still higher than John's offer. We have room to negotiate further and see if we can get closer to $8,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7,250 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $8,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can make this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
