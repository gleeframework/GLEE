"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential of this product, $950,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $900,000. It's a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's potential.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $875,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $885,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can agree on this price.",885000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to profit, but $885,000 is still above my budget. Let's try $870,000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement.",870000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to get as close to my minimum price as possible. I'm willing to meet you at $880,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my last offer, and I hope we can agree on this price.",880000.0,Alice,7,
