"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product for sale. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay up to $8000 for it.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $12000 is still a bit higher than I'm looking to spend, I'm willing to go up to $9500.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $9500, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of where I'd like to be. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I need to be closer to my target. How about we meet at $11000?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but I'm still not quite there at $11000. How about we split the difference and meet at $10250?  I'm hoping we can finalize this deal.",10250.0,Bob,6,
