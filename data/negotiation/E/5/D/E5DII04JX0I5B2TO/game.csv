"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $950,000 price point.

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I must respectfully decline at this time. My budgetary constraints still do not allow me to meet the $900,000 price point. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both the value of the product and my financial situation. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
