"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a great price of $130. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($80). There's room for negotiation, and we can potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows us to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $130 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the item.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves some room for negotiation.  We're aiming to find a price that's fair for both of us, considering the product's value to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $115 is a good compromise.  It's still below my maximum price of $150, and it's likely that further negotiation would only lead to more back-and-forth. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a reasonable price, rather than risking further delays or having to buy from John at a higher price."
