Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and leaves room for negotiation. It also reflects the value the product holds for Bob. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept but also leave him some room to counter if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than what I'm aiming for. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,100,000, which is still a good profit for me and hopefully more appealing to Bob. This shows a willingness to compromise and hopefully will lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $950,000 is a decent price, it's still below my preferred range, and continuing negotiations might lead to further concessions.  Since John is offering my minimum acceptable price, it's a safer option to sell to him and guarantee a significant profit.  This eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially lowering the price further."
