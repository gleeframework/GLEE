(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You have a fixed budget of $800,000.  Alice's offer is exactly your budget, meaning you won't save any money.  Since John is also willing to sell for $800,000, it's the same outcome either way.  You might as well buy from John."
