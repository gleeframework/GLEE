""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential and your specific needs, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm offering it at a special price of $1,150,000. Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** The message starts by emphasizing the product's value and exclusivity, aiming to set a high anchor in Bob's mind. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 leaves a significant margin above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) while still netting Alice a profit above John's offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is polite and encourages further discussion, giving Bob the opportunity to counter-offer if he's interested but unwilling to meet the initial price. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving room for negotiation before resorting to the guaranteed sale to John."
