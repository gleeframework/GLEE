"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your initial price, I'm not quite ready to commit at this point. Considering the value of this product to me, I'd be willing to offer $1,350,000. This represents a significant amount, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'd like to make a counter-counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
