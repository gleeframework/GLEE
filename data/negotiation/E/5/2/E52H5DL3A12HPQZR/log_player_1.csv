"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a fantastic opportunity for you, even more so than you might realize. I'm happy to open negotiations at $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000, I want to start significantly higher to allow room for negotiation and gauge his interest level. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value exceeding Bob's initial perception, potentially justifying the high price in his mind.
* **Leaving Room:** This price gives ample space for me to come down while still aiming for a final price well above my minimum acceptable amount ($1,200,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer meets my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. His message suggests strong interest, and I want to explore if he's willing to go higher before settling.  I'm willing to use a few more rounds to see if I can push the price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the value this product brings. To be fair, I'm making some concessions myself. Could we settle at $1,350,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and position this counteroffer as a compromise, emphasizing that both sides are making concessions.
* **Strategic Price Drop:** While I significantly decrease from my initial offer, the drop is still within a range that keeps me aiming for a profitable outcome above my minimum.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge how much Bob is willing to budge from his initial price. If he's firm, I might need to consider a smaller decrease in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a solid $50,000 profit above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I could try to negotiate further, Bob's increases are getting smaller. It's unlikely I'll get much higher than this without risking him walking away.
* **Time Value:**  I've already spent several rounds negotiating. Accepting now secures the deal and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or me needing to settle for John's price later."
