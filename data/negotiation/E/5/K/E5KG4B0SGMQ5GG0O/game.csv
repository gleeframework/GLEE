"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal and avoid going back and forth any further.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1,200,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and meets your budget.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here.  $1,250,000 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000. This shows that I'm serious about closing a deal, but I'm also sure you understand this product is worth more to you than it is to me.  How about we meet in the middle and finalize this today?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,300,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a deal. I'll meet you at $1,230,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",1230000.0,Alice,7,
