"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm not quite ready to pay that much.  I'm willing to offer $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's original offer, but it's still above Alice's minimum value of $10,000. This approach aims to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate further while leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low just yet.  How about we split the difference and meet at $11,000?  That's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is a compromise that is still within Bob's budget.  It's a better price than John's offer, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly lower price.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
