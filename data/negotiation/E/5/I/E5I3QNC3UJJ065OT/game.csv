"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $950,000 for this purchase. I believe this is a fair price considering the current market conditions and the potential return on investment. I look forward to your response.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. While $950,000 is a significant offer, it falls short of what I need to make this transaction worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  I believe this price reflects both our needs and allows for a successful partnership.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I am still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. This aligns closely with the value I believe the product offers and stays within my financial limits. I hope this proposal is acceptable and we can move forward with the transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
