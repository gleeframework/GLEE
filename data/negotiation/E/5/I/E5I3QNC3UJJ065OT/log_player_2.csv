Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. While $950,000 is a significant offer, it falls short of what I need to make this transaction worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  I believe this price reflects both our needs and allows for a successful partnership.  Let's see if we can find common ground.
