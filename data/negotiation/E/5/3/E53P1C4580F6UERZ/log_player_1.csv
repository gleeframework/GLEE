Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could offer the product at $150 (its value to me), there's a chance Bob will find it too expensive. Offering it slightly lower at $140 increases the likelihood of a sale and still nets a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** By pricing it just above Bob's perceived value ($120), he might be swayed by the ""deal"" and the fear of missing out.  
* **Backup Plan:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, I'm covered with John who's willing to pay $150."
