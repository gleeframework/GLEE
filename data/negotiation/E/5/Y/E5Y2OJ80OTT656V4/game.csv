"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I put into it. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford. Would you consider $7,000 for the product?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting closer to your budget, but $7,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
