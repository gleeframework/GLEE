"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate and see if you can get a better price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:**  While $6,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong starting point for negotiation. This leaves room for you to increase your offer incrementally while still aiming for a price well below your $8,000 limit.
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help you understand how willing Alice is to negotiate. If she completely rejects this low price, it might indicate a tougher negotiation ahead."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I put into it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice moved considerably from her initial offer, $9,000 is still above your $8,000 maximum and John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice meeting you ""halfway"" suggests she's open to further negotiation.  There are still several rounds left to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford. Would you consider $7,000 for the product?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  This counteroffer shows Alice you're willing to move upward, but you're still aiming for a price below your maximum.
* **Testing the Waters:** Offering $7,000 tests whether Alice is willing to go below $8,000. If she rejects this, you'll know that John's offer might be your best bet."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're getting closer to your budget, but $7,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice Won't Budge:** Alice has explicitly stated that $8,200 is her lowest price. 
* **John's Offer is Better:**  John's offer of $8,000 is now more appealing. Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a better deal. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at a price you're comfortable with."
