"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  While it's below your maximum budget, there's significant room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering your own valuation and the potential value to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product and the value you've expressed it has to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my ideal price, it's still higher than my initial counteroffer. I believe there's still room for further negotiation, so I'll reject the offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $762,500 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 762500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $762,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $800,000. This is my minimum price, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is her minimum price, and it's closer to my initial counteroffer of $700,000.  It's also significantly lower than the price John is offering ($1,500,000). Accepting this offer will save me a considerable amount of money, making it the best choice in this round."
