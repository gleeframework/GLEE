"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price reflects its worth while acknowledging your enthusiasm.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1,225,000. I think this is a fair compromise.",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be closer to my desired price point.  Would you consider $1,237,500? This offer keeps us moving forward and reflects the value of the product.",1237500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,237,500 is the best price for me. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'm not going to break the bank. I'll counter with $1,220,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1220000.0,Bob,6,
