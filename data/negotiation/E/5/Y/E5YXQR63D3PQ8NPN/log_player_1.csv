Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to extract as much value from Bob as possible without losing the sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $145 is a strong starting point. It's a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but still offers a small discount compared to what you'll get from John.
* **Negotiation Room:** The message leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can potentially lower the price slightly and still make a profit above your minimum."
