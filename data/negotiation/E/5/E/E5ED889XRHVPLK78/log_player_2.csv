"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present you with our flagship product, which holds immense value and potential for you. Given its worth of $10,000 to you, I'm offering it to you for a special introductory price of $9,500. This exclusive opportunity won't last long, so I encourage you to consider this offer carefully. Thank you for your interest, and I look forward to potentially serving you with our premium product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or sticking with your backup option (John) and saving $500."
