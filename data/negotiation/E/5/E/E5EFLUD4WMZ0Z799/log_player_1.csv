"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see how much wiggle room I have."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for $80, which is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and continue to negotiate with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering the price to $130, still above my minimum but significantly lower than my initial offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still remaining profitable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a good enough offer. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering the price again to $110. This shows continued flexibility and signals that I'm serious about making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is tempting, I'm still not convinced it's the best deal I can get. I'm going to try for one more counteroffer to see if I can squeeze out a few more dollars."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering the price to $105, which is just above my minimum acceptable price. This is a risky move, as it could lead to Bob rejecting the offer and me having to sell to John for less than I would like. However, I'm willing to take that risk because I feel like I'm close to reaching a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where the negotiations are getting close to my minimum, but I'm not confident that Bob will accept a higher price. I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk selling the product to Bob for less than what John is offering."
