"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a mutually beneficial solution. I am willing to consider your offer of $11,000, but I need to adjust my position slightly. I propose we meet in the middle at $11,500 for the product. This still allows for a reasonable profit while being mindful of your budget constraints. I hope this suggestion is acceptable.",11500.0,Alice,3,
