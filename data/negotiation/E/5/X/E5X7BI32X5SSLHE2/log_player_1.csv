Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Maximize Potential Gain:**  By starting high, I maximize the potential profit if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can always lower the price slightly in subsequent negotiations. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This offer will help me understand how much Bob values the product and how willing he is to negotiate."
