"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential, but $900,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?"", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $775,000. This is a compromise that still gives me a good profit, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $750,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This seems like a good point to accept.  Alice is signaling this is her final offer and while we could likely negotiate a bit lower, we're already in a good position. Accepting at $750,000 saves us a significant amount compared to John's $1,500,000 price."
