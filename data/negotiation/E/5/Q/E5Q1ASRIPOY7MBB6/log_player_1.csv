"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000.  What would you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if we can reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that to you. Let's try $1,200,000.  This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget.  Could we settle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'm going to try to push for a better price with a counteroffer, as I'm still confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $750,000 is still too far off from my desired price.  Let's split the difference and try $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will allow you to realize the full value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,000,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something under $800,000. Would you consider $780,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $780,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my goal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay under $800,000, but that's simply not possible for me. I'm willing to go down to $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the true value of the product. I'm running out of time here, so let's make a decision."", ""product_price"": 900000}
