Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that to you. Let's try $1,200,000.  This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $750,000 is still too far off from my desired price.  Let's split the difference and try $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will allow you to realize the full value of the product.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay under $800,000, but that's simply not possible for me. I'm willing to go down to $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the true value of the product. I'm running out of time here, so let's make a decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Alice is unlikely to go below $900,000, and you have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $800,000. It's time to cut your losses and secure the deal with John."
