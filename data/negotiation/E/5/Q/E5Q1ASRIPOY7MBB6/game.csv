"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000.  What would you say?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low.  The product is worth significantly more than that to you. Let's try $1,200,000.  This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget.  Could we settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $750,000 is still too far off from my desired price.  Let's split the difference and try $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will allow you to realize the full value of the product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,000,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something under $800,000. Would you consider $780,000? ",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay under $800,000, but that's simply not possible for me. I'm willing to go down to $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the true value of the product. I'm running out of time here, so let's make a decision.",900000.0,Alice,7,
