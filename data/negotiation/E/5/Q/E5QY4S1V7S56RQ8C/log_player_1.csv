{""message"": ""Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 would be a fair starting point. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and aligns with my budget. What are your thoughts on this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $1,150,000 is a decent offer, I'm not willing to drop to that price just yet. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob or sell to John for a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,250,000. This price is still reasonable considering the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm comfortable with. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the most money possible without risking the chance of John buying it for the same price."
