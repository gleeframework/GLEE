Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and has a guaranteed sale at that price to John.  Starting high allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message doesn't just throw out a number. It emphasizes ""exclusive opportunity,"" ""value,"" and ""potential"" to frame the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the offer is significantly higher than Bob's valuation, it doesn't make negotiation impossible. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can then decide whether to move closer to $800,000 or hold firm knowing she has another buyer.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round offer. In a real-world negotiation, there would likely be back-and-forth communication allowing for adjustments based on Bob's responses."
