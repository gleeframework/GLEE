You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's less than her asking price, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You have room to negotiate and can potentially get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. You're showing Alice that you're serious about buying the product but are also determined to get a good deal."

You are now close to your price limit.  A counteroffer of $9,500 is likely to be accepted by Alice, especially since she rejected your prior offer and is showing a willingness to negotiate."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

You should buy the product from John. Alice is now firm at $10,000, which is more than your ideal price. Since you can get the product for $8,000 from John, it makes more sense to close the deal with John."
