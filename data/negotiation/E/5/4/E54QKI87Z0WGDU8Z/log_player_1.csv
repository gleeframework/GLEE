Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Appeal to fairness:** I'm framing the price as a ""discount"" to make it seem more attractive to Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not asking for my full value, which shows I'm open to compromise. 
* **Prepared to walk away:** I'm aware of John's offer, which gives me a strong negotiating position and allows me to walk away if the price doesn't meet my minimum requirements."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value of $1,500,000, it's still significantly lower than my desired outcome. I'm willing to take a smaller profit to secure a sale, but I believe there's more room for negotiation. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique benefits and its value to you.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I've reduced my price to $1,000,000, showing willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm reminding Bob about the product's benefits and value to him, emphasizing the value proposition.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward. 
* **Stating a finality:** While open to further discussion, I'm implying that this might be my final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,000,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think $950,000 is the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is only $50,000 away from my counteroffer of $1,000,000. 
* **Time factor:**  The negotiation has gone back and forth, and it's likely that further counteroffers will take longer. 
* **Minimizing loss:**  While $950,000 is still less than my desired profit, it's closer to my minimum acceptable value. Selling to Bob will allow me to secure a sale and avoid potential complications with a longer negotiation process. 
* **John's offer:**  While I can sell to John for a higher price,  the certainty of a sale with Bob at $950,000 is appealing."
