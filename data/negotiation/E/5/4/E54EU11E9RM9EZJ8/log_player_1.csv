Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so any price below that gives him a potential benefit.
* **My Floor:** I have a minimum acceptable price of $10,000 (John's offer).
* **Negotiation Space:**  This leaves a $5,000 negotiation space.
* **Splitting the Difference:** Offering $12,500 splits this space fairly between us.

This offer has a high chance of being accepted by Bob while still allowing me to earn a significant profit."
