"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal. There are 10 rounds to negotiate, and it's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is better than $12,000, it's still above Bob's target.  It's worth seeing if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $11,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go down to $11,000 just yet. I'm willing to offer the product for $11,750. This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $11,750 is closer to his target than previous offers, it's still above his desired price point. With several rounds remaining, it's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further.  There's also a chance that Alice might become more willing to compromise as the rounds progress."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This would be a good compromise and help us both reach a favorable agreement."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not willing to go up to $11,250 just yet. I'm willing to offer the product for $11,500, which is still a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is not Bob's ideal price, it's getting closer to his desired range, and there are only a few rounds left.  There's a risk of Alice becoming more stubborn or even raising the price if Bob continues to reject offers.  Also, if Bob goes to John, he'll end up paying $15,000, which is significantly more. Accepting Alice's offer is the best option at this point to secure a good deal within Bob's budget."
