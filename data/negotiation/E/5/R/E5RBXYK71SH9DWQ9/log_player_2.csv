"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1000000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's always worth trying to negotiate and see if Alice will go lower.  There's a good chance she's willing to drop the price a bit further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit more, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $925000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1000000. What do you think?

Alice has come down to $925,000, which is a good price for me considering my target price of $1,000,000.  I'm not sure I can get her lower, and it's a better deal than buying from John."
