"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $110. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget of $120. You can try to negotiate a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $105 at this time.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a good deal on this product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $115 is still within my budget of $120.  While I'd prefer to pay less, it's a fair compromise and  saves me from the risk of getting stuck with John's higher price."
