Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $1,600,000? This gives us both room to negotiate and ensures a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.
