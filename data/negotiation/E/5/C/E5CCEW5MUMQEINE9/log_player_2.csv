"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. This is still a good deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

While I could try to negotiate further, $825,000 is a reasonable price and a significant savings compared to John's offer. It's unlikely Alice will go much lower. Accepting now secures a good deal."
