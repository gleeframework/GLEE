,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1100000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less.  I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm still confident that it's worth more than $1000000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1050000 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for $1000000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at this point.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go below $1050000. I've already compromised a lot, and I think this price is a fair reflection of the product's value. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1020000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
