"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $82. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $82 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference and I pay $78?  Let's make this happen.",78.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $79. It's getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",79.0,Alice,5,
