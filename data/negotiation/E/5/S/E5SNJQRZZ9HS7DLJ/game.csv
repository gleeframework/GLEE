"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiation.  What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of the product, $1,350,000 is a bit steep for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This represents a significant saving for you and a fair price for me, considering my budget.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This price reflects the product's true value while still offering you a substantial discount.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,225,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. How about we settle at $1,150,000?  This would be a good compromise and allow us both to get a fair deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best possible price, and I respect that.  However, the value of this product is significant, and I can't go as low as $1,150,000. My final offer is $1,180,000. This is a very competitive price, and I need to finalize this deal soon.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
