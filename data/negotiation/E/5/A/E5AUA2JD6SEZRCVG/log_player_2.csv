You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is trying to inch up the price, but it's still better to reject and counter-offer. You can likely get a better price than $975,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is getting closer to your maximum price. While you could counter-offer again, there's a good chance she'll keep increasing the price, potentially pushing it above your limit.  Buying from John guarantees you'll get the product for a price you're comfortable with, even if it's slightly higher than the best possible deal with Alice.  It's a calculated risk to avoid potentially losing out on the product altogether."
