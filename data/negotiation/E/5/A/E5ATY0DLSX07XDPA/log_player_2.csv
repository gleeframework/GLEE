{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. By offering $1,000,000, he's showing Alice he's serious about buying but wants a price closer to his ideal.  This is a bold move, but it might push Alice to counter with a price more agreeable."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high for Bob. While it's closer to his initial goal, he can still try to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue bargaining and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's raised his offer from $1,000,000, showing willingness to compromise. However, he's still significantly below Alice's latest offer, aiming to secure a price closer to his desired range. This counteroffer might encourage Alice to consider a price closer to Bob's target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Alice's offer is the best Bob can get.  He's already rejected a lower price ($1,100,000) and knows that going back and forth with Alice might lead to further negotiations.  Since John's price is $1,500,000, accepting Alice's offer at $1,300,000 is the most financially beneficial choice."
