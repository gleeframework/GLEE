Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $160. It's a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $160 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $120. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can get good use out of the product."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $160 is still a bit high for you, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer it to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although it's getting closer to his maximum budget, he can still try to get a better deal. He knows he can buy from John for $120, so there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to find a solution. However, $140 is still above what I'm able to spend at this time. I'm firm on my offer of $120. If you're not able to accept that, I'll unfortunately have to move on to another seller."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer of $120, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice has offered $130, which is still higher than his desired price. He knows he can get the same product from John for $120.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice, as she has shown she's unlikely to go lower than $130, and there's a chance they won't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds."
