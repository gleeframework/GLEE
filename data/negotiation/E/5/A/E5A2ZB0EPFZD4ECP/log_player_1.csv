Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I'd be more comfortable with a price closer to $600,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  How about we settle at $700,000? I think that's a fair compromise.
