"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll see its worth. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $600,000. I understand that's a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and it's a great opportunity for you to secure a deal. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  How about we settle at $700,000? I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a compromise, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $700,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000, and you can get the product for $800,000 from John.  There's no point in risking further negotiation with Alice."
