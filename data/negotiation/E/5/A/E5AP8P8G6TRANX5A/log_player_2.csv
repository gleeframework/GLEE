Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're getting close to walking away, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to meet you at $11,400. It's a small step closer to your original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.

It's time to walk away. Alice seems unwilling to budge below $11,000, and her counteroffers are getting further away from my target. Buying from John for $15,000, while not ideal, prevents me from wasting further time and potentially ending up with a worse deal from Alice as we approach the round limit."
