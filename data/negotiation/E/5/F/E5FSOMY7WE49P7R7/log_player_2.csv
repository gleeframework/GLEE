"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $8,800?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8800}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $8,800 is a bit below my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $9,200. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,200 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $10,000 and is close enough to Bob's desired price point to make it worthwhile. Accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product at a good price without further negotiation."
