"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get the product for less than $1,400,000. There's room for negotiation since Alice is willing to sell for $1,000,000, and Bob is willing to pay up to $1,500,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, but it's also a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,300,000, which is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and still leaves room for Alice to profit.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers and ultimately make the deal with John."
