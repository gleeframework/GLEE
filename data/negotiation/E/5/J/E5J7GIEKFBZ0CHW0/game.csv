"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to go up to $850000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",850000.0,Alice,5,
