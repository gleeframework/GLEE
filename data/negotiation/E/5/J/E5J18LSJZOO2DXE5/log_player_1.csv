Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is $1,000 higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This is a good starting point because it gives me some room to negotiate and still get a good price. I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for $12,000 if Bob rejects my offer, so I don't need to be too aggressive with my initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since Bob is willing to pay the minimum amount I'm willing to accept, there's no point in continuing to negotiate.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick and successful sale."
