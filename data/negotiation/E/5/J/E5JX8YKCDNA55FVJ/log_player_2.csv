"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, as you'll be saving a significant amount. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you. While it might be worth $15,000 to *someone*, your maximum valuation is your guiding point.
* You have a guaranteed fallback option with John at $15,000. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that the price is too high. This might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her own valuation of $8,000. 

Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate further!"
