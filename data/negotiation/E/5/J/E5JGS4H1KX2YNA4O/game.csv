"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value our negotiation, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This reflects the product's value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm getting closer to a number I'm comfortable with, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high.  Would you consider $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $1,150,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and leaves room for a win-win outcome.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
