"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$9,500 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation. Since you have 10 rounds, you can try to get a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to explore if you can get it for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for further negotiation. I want to see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway, and gauge her willingness to compromise."
