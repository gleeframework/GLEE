"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $875,000 still isn't working for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal, I'm sure we can both be happy with this outcome.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're pushing the boundaries of your budget. However, $885,000 just isn't enough for me.  To make this work, I'll accept $895,000. This is a very fair compromise, and allows us to both walk away satisfied. Let's get this done.",895000.0,Alice,7,
