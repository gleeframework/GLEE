"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you at $2,000,000 for this round.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  While I know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, I'm starting significantly higher at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down and still achieve a price well above my minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** My opening offer signals that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I want to remind Bob of the product's value, potentially exceeding his initial assessment. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Willingness to Pay:** His response will give me insight into how aggressively he might counteroffer.
2. **Anchor the Negotiation:** Starting high sets a reference point that might lead to a more favorable outcome even after negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. This is my maximum offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has immediately gone to his maximum offer, which is lower than my minimum. While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, I still have ample rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and understanding that this product has significant value. While your initial offer is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to work with you. To show that, I'll come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession of $200,000 (from $2,000,000 to $1,800,000) to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still aiming well above both Bob's offer and my minimum price. 
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify the price, hoping to manage his expectations and prevent lowball counteroffers.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This counteroffer provides ample room for further negotiation while still aiming for a profitable outcome.

The goal is to meet somewhere in the middle while ensuring Bob feels like he's getting a deal without significantly undervaluing the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my initial offer of $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at his maximum offer, but it's still too early to concede. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to signal that his lowball offer isn't swaying me.  John's offer provides a safety net, but I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with strategic negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I need you to understand that $1,200,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm acknowledging Bob's stance but standing my ground on the value of the product. I'm emphasizing that his offer is not reflective of what's being offered.
* **Significant Drop:** The drop to $1,600,000 is a substantial move designed to encourage Bob to reconsider his position and show that I'm serious about reaching a deal.
* **Final Offer Signal (but not stated):**  While I'm not explicitly stating it's my final offer, the significant price drop and the language used suggest that I'm nearing my limit.

This approach aims to:

1. **Elicit a Meaningful Counter:**  Bob's response will reveal if he's willing to negotiate beyond his initial offer.
2. **Maintain a Strong Position:** I'm avoiding a back-and-forth of small concessions that could weaken my position.
3. **Keep the Door Open:** There's still room for negotiation if Bob shows flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob has finally moved off his initial offer and is now willing to pay a price that's above my minimum. $1,400,000 represents a fair compromise where both parties are making concessions.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation further carries the risk of Bob walking away or my position weakening. Accepting now secures a significant profit without unnecessary delay.
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting Bob's offer in a spirit of compromise can help establish a positive business relationship for potential future dealings.

While I could potentially squeeze a bit more out of the negotiation, accepting $1,400,000 at this stage is a strategic win."
