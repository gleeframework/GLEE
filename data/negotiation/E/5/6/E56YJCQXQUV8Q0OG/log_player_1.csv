{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $19,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering what you could gain. What are your thoughts?"",

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations above your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your desired outcome. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price, even if it's just emphasizing the ""value and potential,"" makes the offer seem more reasonable. 
* **Open to Discussion:** By asking for Bob's thoughts and phrasing it as an ""initial proposal,""  you signal that you're willing to negotiate.

**Important Note:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer in John, aiming higher with Bob might lead to a more profitable outcome. However, it's crucial to find a balance between a strong offer and not pushing Bob away completely."
