{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and a great price for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so this price gives him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You are willing to sell for at least $1,500,000, so this offer leaves room for you to potentially earn more.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's not too high that Bob will immediately reject it, and it's not too low that you'll feel like you're giving away too much.

This offer also includes a message to Bob that frames the deal in a positive way, highlighting the benefits for both parties."

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a better price. I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob, and if not, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000."
