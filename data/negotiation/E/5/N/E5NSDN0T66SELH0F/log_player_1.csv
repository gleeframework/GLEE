Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500.  I think it's a fair price that reflects the value it brings. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice if he accepts.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 gives Alice a strong fallback position, so she doesn't have to settle for less than what she values the product at. 

**Why not other prices?**

* **$12,000 or higher:**  Unlikely Bob will accept since it's more than his perceived value.
* **$10,000:**  While Bob would likely accept, Alice loses potential profit. 
* **Significantly below $11,500:**  Leaves too much potential profit on the table."
