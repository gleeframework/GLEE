"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than your minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It shows Bob you value the product and are not giving it away cheaply.  By offering a higher price, we're attempting to gauge Bob's interest level and potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than the $10,000 we'd get from John, it's still below our desired value.  We'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to try and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

We're going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between our initial offer and Bob's offer. We're showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to our desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob hasn't budged from his $12,000 offer.  We've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and it's unlikely he'll go higher.  At this point, accepting $12,000 is better than risking further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with the lower price from John."
