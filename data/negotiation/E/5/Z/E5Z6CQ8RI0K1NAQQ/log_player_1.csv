Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price that is above Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while also leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer if he feels it's too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find it elsewhere for a lower price. Would you consider selling it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $95 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. "", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $95 is closer than before, I still believe there's room for a better deal. Could you consider selling the product to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get $100, $90 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely that further negotiations would only drag this out and potentially lead to a lower offer from Bob or even a rejection. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
