"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could you do $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $650,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you see in the product. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit. How about $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $725,000 is just not feasible for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $850,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get what we need. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,5,
