"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me and still leaves you with a significant profit margin.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. $1,000,000 is still too high for you. You can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still gives you a good margin, and it's a significant step closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to your budget, it's still not ideal. You can try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This is a reasonable compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's aim for a deal that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account both of our needs.  I believe this price allows us to reach an agreement that benefits us both. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're getting closer to your goal price, but $925,000 is still a bit high. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $900,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $912,500. This would be a good compromise, and I believe it's a price that we can both agree on.  Let's seal the deal!"", ""product_price"": 912500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're nearing the end of our negotiation, and I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to meet you at $920,000. This is a final compromise that would allow us to both walk away happy. Let's close this deal now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've reached a point where the negotiations are taking a long time, and Alice is unlikely to go much lower. While $920,000 is close to your budget, it's still more than you'd like to pay. It's better to cut your losses and buy the product from John for a guaranteed price of $800,000."
