Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.
