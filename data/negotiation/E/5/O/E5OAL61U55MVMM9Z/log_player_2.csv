"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than $120, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:** This offer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's a significant step down from Alice's initial offer but still leaves some room for compromise.
* **Clear Message:** The message clearly expresses Bob's interest in the product while stating his price point.
* **Focus on Value:**  By mentioning ""comfortable with"", Bob subtly hints at the product's value to him, implying a lower acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not quite willing to go down to $105. How about we meet in the middle at $108? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Alice's offer of $108 is a good compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his previous offer. 
* **Value:**  $108 is still within Bob's budget of $120, and closer to his desired price than John's offer. 
* **Potential for Regret:**  Rejecting this offer could lead to further negotiation, but also the risk of Alice becoming more firm on her price or the negotiation dragging on.  

While Bob could try to get a slightly lower price, accepting this offer is a smart move, securing a good deal and avoiding potential risks."
