Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,000 is fair. What do you think?

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $10,250 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```"
