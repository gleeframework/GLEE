"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This establishes a strong negotiating position and puts pressure on Alice to come down.  While this is a risky move, it's a good starting point to see how flexible Alice is."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $17,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum price. He has more rounds to negotiate and can likely get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increases his counteroffer to $12,000. This is a significant increase from his previous offer, showing that he's willing to move towards Alice's price, but still firmly within his budget.  The goal is to see if Alice will meet him halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is exactly Bob's maximum budget. There's no point in rejecting the offer and risking getting a higher price, especially since he can get the same price from John.  Accepting this offer is the most logical choice."
