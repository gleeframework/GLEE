"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
