"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still reflects the value of this product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the best way to move forward.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $775,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $812,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",812500.0,Alice,5,
