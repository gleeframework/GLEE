{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000** is a starting point that is significantly lower than my personal value of $1,000,000 but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.
* I've included a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* By starting with a lower offer, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially move towards a higher price through counter-offers.
* If Bob rejects, I have the option to counter-offer or sell to John for my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price around $750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me. While I could potentially negotiate further with Bob, I'm not willing to risk losing more money if he continues to lowball me. 

I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round, where I can counter-offer and try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still reflects the value of this product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the best way to move forward.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I've countered with a price of $850,000. This is a compromise that moves closer to Bob's offer but still keeps me above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and reiterates the value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider the counter-offer.
* **Goal:** My aim is to reach a middle ground that allows me to maximize profit while remaining open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $775,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough.  I'm not willing to settle for a price that is significantly lower than the value of the product to me, especially when I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price of $1,000,000.

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make another counter-offer.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can reach a price that is more favorable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $775,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $812,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 812500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I've countered with a price of $812,500, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $850,000 and Bob's latest offer of $775,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes fairness and the potential for both of us to be satisfied. 
* **Goal:** I aim to reach a middle ground that allows me to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open. I'm confident that this counter-offer will be more appealing to Bob, leading us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $795,000, but no higher. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, his latest offer of $795,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob at this point seems unlikely to lead to a deal that would meet my needs.

Therefore, I have decided to sell the product to John for $1,000,000, as this guarantees me a price that reflects the product's value to me.  While I would have preferred to sell it to Bob at a higher price, this option ensures that I don't lose out on a substantial profit."
