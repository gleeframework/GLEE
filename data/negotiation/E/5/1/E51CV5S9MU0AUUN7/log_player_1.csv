{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  You're aiming for a profit, and $1,400,000 is well above your $1,200,000 minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room for a compromise. 
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  Bob knows exactly what you're proposing, making it easy for him to respond.

Let me know how Bob responds and I'll help you negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I don't think it's worth the full $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, you can likely do better.  He values the product at $1,500,000, so there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and try to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still gives you a significant discount from what the product is worth to you.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is a compromise, falling between your initial offer of $1,400,000 and Bob's offer of $1,200,000. 
* **Highlighting value:** By reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, you reinforce the potential benefit he's missing out on.
* **Maintaining leverage:** You're not giving in completely, but are showing flexibility to encourage a deal.

Let me know how Bob responds to this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,400,000, so I'll offer $1,250,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  You're better off rejecting this offer and continuing the negotiation. You can counter with a price closer to your desired price and try to secure a better deal. Remember, you have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, so you're not losing out by rejecting Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still slightly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,280,000.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer of $1,300,000 and Bob's offer of $1,250,000. 
* **Emphasizing fairness:** By mentioning Bob's own valuation of the product, you're making the offer seem reasonable and fair.

This counteroffer shows flexibility while still protecting your interests. Let me know how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,280,000 is your minimum, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not willing to go above $1,280,000. I'll offer $1,270,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,270,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,270,000 is still slightly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it's very close.  Since Bob has declared this his final offer, rejecting it might lead to a stalemate.  

Here's why accepting is the best option:

* **Small difference:**  The difference between $1,270,000 and your minimum is only $70,000.  This is a relatively small amount compared to the total value of the product.
* **Potential for future deals:**  Accepting Bob's offer could open the door for future business with him.  Building a relationship with a buyer is valuable.
* **Avoiding risk:**  Rejecting the offer could lead to a lengthy negotiation or even a failed deal.  It's better to secure a slightly lower price than risk losing the sale altogether.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a decent profit and avoid unnecessary risk."
