"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I don't think it's worth the full $1,400,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still gives you a significant discount from what the product is worth to you.  Let's meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,400,000, so I'll offer $1,250,000. Can you consider this price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still slightly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,280,000. This is a fair price considering your own valuation of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,280,000 is your minimum, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not willing to go above $1,280,000. I'll offer $1,270,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1270000.0,Bob,6,
