Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John provides a safety net at $1,200,000, aiming for the highest possible price with Bob is crucial.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, giving us room to negotiate above our minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation ($1,400,000) makes the deal very attractive to him. It represents a $100,000 gain for Bob if he accepts.
* **Confident Negotiation:** The message uses positive language, emphasizing the product's value and the ""exclusive"" nature of the offer to encourage Bob's acceptance.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might try to negotiate further. Having a counter-offer strategy prepared (e.g., a slightly lower price with a faster closing time) can be beneficial."
