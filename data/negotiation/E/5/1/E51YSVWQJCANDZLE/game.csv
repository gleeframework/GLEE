"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which reflects a fair value considering my needs and the market.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and engaging in this discussion.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is solidly above that mark. I can be flexible, but not to that degree.  Would you consider $1,150,000?  I believe that's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're passionate about this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $1,150,000 is still too steep for me.  How about $950,000? This would allow us both to reach a fair compromise. ",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation.  Let's bridge this gap.  If we land on $1,050,000, we'll both walk away feeling we got a good deal.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit above my ideal range, but I'm ready to make a final offer.  $975,000 is the absolute maximum I can go.  Let's close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
