"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time. I'm confident this is a fair price considering my maximum budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While we're not quite aligned yet, I'm willing to work with you.  To find a middle ground, I propose a revised price of $1,300,000.  This accounts for the product's unique value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my maximum. I'm prepared to pay $950,000, which reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
