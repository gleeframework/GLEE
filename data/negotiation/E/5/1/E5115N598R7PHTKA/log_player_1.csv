"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time. I'm confident this is a fair price considering my maximum budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While we're not quite aligned yet, I'm willing to work with you.  To find a middle ground, I propose a revised price of $1,300,000.  This accounts for the product's unique value while acknowledging your budget considerations."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my maximum. I'm prepared to pay $950,000, which reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's becoming clear that his absolute ceiling is unlikely to be significantly higher than $950,000. Accepting his current offer means losing out on a potential $50,000. Given John is offering $1,000,000, it's more strategically sound to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
