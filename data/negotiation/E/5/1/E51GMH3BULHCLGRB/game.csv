"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $1,250,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still slightly higher than my budget.  I'm happy to pay $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,150,000 isn't quite working for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000, which is my absolute bottom line. Let's close this deal!",1200000.0,Alice,5,
