Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it seem like you're willing to compromise.
* **Close to Your Minimum:** While we start high, we don't want to go too far above Bob's potential value ($80).  Offering it at $140 keeps it within a reasonable range and ensures you're well above your minimum if he accepts. 
* **Leaving John as Backup:**  John guarantees you'll get at least $150.  This offer to Bob aims to potentially get even more."
