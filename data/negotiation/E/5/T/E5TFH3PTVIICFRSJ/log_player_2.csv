"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm asking for $16,000. I think it's a fair price considering what it can do for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is way above your maximum budget. It's best to reject and negotiate for a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $16,000 is way beyond my budget for this product. I'd be willing to pay $6,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point to negotiate. It is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows you to understand Alice's lower bound."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $6,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While closer to your budget, $10,000 is still above your $8,000 limit. There's room for negotiation, so it's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. However, $10,000 is still a bit high for me. Could you consider $7,500? I'm eager to make this work."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

This counter-offer shows Alice you are willing to negotiate but also sets a firm boundary below your $8,000 fallback option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $9,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down significantly and this offer is within your budget and a good deal compared to John's $8,000 price."
