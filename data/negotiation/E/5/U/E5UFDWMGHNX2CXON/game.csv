"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to try to get as close to the market value as possible.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,500 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This allows me to make a reasonable profit while ensuring you get a fantastic product at a fair price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $10,750? I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to make a decision soon, but I need to stay within my budget.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm committed to finding a solution.  I'm willing to come down to $10,900, which is very close to your offer.  This is a great price for a product that you know is worth $12,000. Let's close this deal! ",10900.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,900, but I'm still a bit short. Would you be willing to go down to $10,750 again? I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to make a decision soon, but I need to stay within my budget.",10750.0,Bob,6,
