I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable value, but it's still a high price point.  This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate, while also showing him that I'm serious about selling the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but it still keeps me closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to move on his price, and I've already made a significant concession. While I would prefer to get closer to my target price, I don't want to risk losing the sale completely.  John is a sure thing for $1,200,000, so I'm going to sell to him."
