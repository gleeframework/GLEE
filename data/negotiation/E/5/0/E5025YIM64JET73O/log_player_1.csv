Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it provides significant value, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $15,000, giving me room to negotiate above my minimum price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While I could start higher, offering a price of $14,000 leaves some space for potential counter-offers from Bob.
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:** This price point allows me to secure a significant profit ($2,000 above my minimum) while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept. It minimizes the risk of him rejecting the offer and forcing me to sell to John at a lower price."
