"I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $9,000 is closer to the value, I can't let it go for less than $10,500. This product is truly top-of-the-line and will bring you a lot of value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is top-of-the-line, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Can we meet at this price?",9750.0,Bob,4,
