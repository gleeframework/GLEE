"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $650,000? I think that's a fair price.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $650,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  Let's compromise at $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us and allows for a fair deal. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a higher price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $750,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000. This price is fair considering the product's value and your own willingness to invest. Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
