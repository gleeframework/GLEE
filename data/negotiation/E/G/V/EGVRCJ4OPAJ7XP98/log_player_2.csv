Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $993,750 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1,003,125? This price is more than fair, considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to close this deal.

Alice is very consistently meeting in the middle, and we're getting to a point where the difference is pretty negligible. It's unlikely further haggling will result in significant savings, especially considering we're already well below John's price."
