It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $11,000 is still a bit higher than your ideal price point, so there's room to push for a better deal."

``` 

While $10,600 is a good deal, it's still slightly higher than what John is offering.  At this point, there's a high chance that further negotiation will only lead to a few hundred dollars in savings, while risking the deal falling through altogether. Buying from John ensures a guaranteed deal at your target price."
