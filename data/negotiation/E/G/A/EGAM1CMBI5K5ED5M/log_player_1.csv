Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering the significant benefit you'll gain. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant benefit"" to entice Bob to accept the offer.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice still has a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000."
