"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you highlighting the product's uniqueness. However, I'm aiming to stay within a budget of $12000. Would you be open to considering a price closer to $10000? I'm genuinely interested in this product and believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value and uniqueness, I'm not comfortable going as low as $10000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $11500. I believe this is a fair price that balances your budget with the product's worth.",11500.0,Alice,3,
