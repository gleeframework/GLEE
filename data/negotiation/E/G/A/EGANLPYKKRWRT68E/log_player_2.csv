"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob has a limit of $12,000, there's no immediate benefit to accepting Alice's offer. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to negotiate down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you highlighting the product's uniqueness. However, I'm aiming to stay within a budget of $12,000. Would you be open to considering a price closer to $10,000? I'm genuinely interested in this product and believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value and uniqueness, I'm not comfortable going as low as $10000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $11500. I believe this is a fair price that balances your budget with the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's budget, and at $11,500, the product is still within Bob's limit of $12,000.  It's a good deal considering the uniqueness of the product and the potential for further negotiation if Bob rejects."
