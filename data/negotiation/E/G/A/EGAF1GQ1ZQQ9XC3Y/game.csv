Thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase such an item. I am willing to pay $10000 for it.,10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique item.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice. I'm still very interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay up to $12000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $12000. How about we meet in the middle at $14000? I think that's a fair price for this exceptional product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I really value this product, but I can only commit to $13000. I hope this offer is acceptable, and we can move forward with the transaction.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still think $13000 is a bit too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. How about we meet at $14500? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a more accurate reflection of the product's value.",14500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still not able to meet you at $14500. I believe $13500 would be a fair price for the product. I hope this offer is within your range.",13500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I think $13500 is still a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $16000? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make it work if it means closing the deal with you.",16000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your efforts, Alice. I've done my best to meet you halfway, but unfortunately, I can't go above $14000. I hope this is the final offer I need to make, and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",14000.0,Bob,10,
