"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he's not, I'm ready to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $90 is still a bit low for me, and I think I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to $100.  How about $95?  That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm increasing the price slightly, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my desired price while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $85 is close to my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a bit more. I think there's still some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow me to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm making another counteroffer, this time meeting Bob halfway between our last offers. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise that gets the deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $90, which would be $87.50. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and it's above my minimum.  It's better to secure a sale at $87.5 than risk going through more rounds and potentially losing the deal altogether."
