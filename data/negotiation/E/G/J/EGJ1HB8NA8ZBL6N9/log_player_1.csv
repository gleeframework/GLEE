Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.

It's time to cut your losses. Bob is unlikely to meet your minimum price, and you have a guaranteed sale with John at $120.  Holding onto the product for a potentially higher offer from Bob isn't worth the risk of him dropping out entirely."
