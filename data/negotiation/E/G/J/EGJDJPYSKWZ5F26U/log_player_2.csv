"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really love it! Would you be interested in purchasing it for $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  Alice is offering the product for $12,000. Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000, but he wants to save as much money as possible. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room for negotiation. Bob can likely get the product for a lower price by making a counteroffer.

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can start the negotiation process and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $11,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Good deal:**  Alice is now offering the product for $11,000, which is well within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's price of $15,000.
* **Limited upside:**  There's not much more room for negotiation. Further counteroffers might risk losing the deal entirely.

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob gets a good deal and avoids the risk of paying a higher price to John."
