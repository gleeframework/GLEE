"I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a bit overpriced, and I'd like to negotiate further.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. I'll accept $925,000, which leaves a bit of room for both of us. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is simply too low for me. It's closer to what I'd sell to John, and I'm confident this product is worth more to you.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $900,000. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to $880,000. I'm willing to go down to $890,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",890000.0,Alice,7,
