"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll reject Alice's offer and send a counteroffer. I want to save as much money as possible, and $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice. I'll try to get the price down to $1,200,000, which is the maximum amount Alice is willing to sell for.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","Alice is trying to get me to meet her halfway, but I'm not willing to budge that much from my counteroffer. I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer, aiming to get even closer to my target price of $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to get the price down even further. Since Alice was willing to meet me halfway last time, I'll try to meet her halfway this time, which would be $1,300,000 / 2 = $1,650,000 / 2 = $825,000 is too low, I will try  $1,300,000 - 50,000 = $1,250,000.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. This is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
