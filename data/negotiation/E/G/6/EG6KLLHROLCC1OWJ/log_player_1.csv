Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your decision as soon as possible."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both you (Alice) and Bob, starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000 provides leverage.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  Bob might be willing to pay a premium if the product is valuable enough to him, hence the $1,500,000 offer.

**Important Note:**  This is a single-round negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, you automatically sell to John for $1,000,000.  There's a balance between aiming high and potentially losing Bob as a buyer."
