"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) than my minimum ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a maximized profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer is not my final price. It signals willingness to negotiate and allows Bob to feel involved in the process.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer at $800,000. This provides a safety net and influences my negotiation strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of something more in the range of $900,000. Could you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is tempting, I believe there's still room for negotiation. His message suggests willingness to find a middle ground. I'll counter with an offer closer to my desired price point, aiming for a win-win situation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you countering, Bob. It shows you're serious about this purchase. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant concession from my initial offer ($1,100,000 to $1,025,000) to show flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""true value,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth and why my price is justified. 
* **Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between his offer ($900,000) and my previous asking price ($1,100,000).
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum ($800,000) to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating progress and continued interest. However, $950,000 is still below my desired outcome. I'll counter with another offer, pushing slightly closer to his price but holding firm on a higher profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you're looking for the best possible deal.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $980,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 980000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm signaling that this is my final offer to add weight to the negotiation and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Slight Concession:**  The $30,000 decrease from my previous offer shows a willingness to compromise, but not at the cost of a significant profit loss. 
* **Time Constraint:**  As we approach the halfway point of the rounds, introducing a sense of urgency can encourage a decision.
* **Alternative Option:** It's important to keep John's offer in mind. While $980,000 is ideal, if Bob continues to push back, I may need to consider John's $800,000 to avoid missing out on a sale altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $980,000 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $980,000 and my original offer of $900,000. Would you consider $970,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Difference:**  The difference between Bob's current offer ($970,000) and my ""final offer"" ($980,000) is relatively small. 
* **Strong Profit:**  Accepting $970,000 still yields a substantial profit and is far above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Continuing to negotiate aggressively carries the risk of Bob walking away. By accepting now, I secure a favorable outcome. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal sooner rather than later allows me to re-invest the earnings or utilize the funds for other opportunities."
