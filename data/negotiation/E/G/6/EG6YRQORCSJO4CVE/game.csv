"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I really like the product, but I have a budget constraint.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value the product at more than $10,000, I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to make this work for both of us. This price is still fair considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. $10,250 is getting very close, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,375? This is the absolute lowest I can go without losing too much. What do you think?",10375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget with $10,375. I'd like to make a final offer of $10,000. If you're willing to sell it to me at this price, I'll make it worth your while.",10000.0,Bob,6,
