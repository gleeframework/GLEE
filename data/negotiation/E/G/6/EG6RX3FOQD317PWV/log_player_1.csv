"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. This is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a quick deal, but also want to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to close a deal, I'm not willing to sell for significantly less than my minimum value. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is too far below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,750?  This still leaves some room for profit for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $11,750 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you do $10,500? That would really help me make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm starting to get impatient, $10,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down a little more, but not that much. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,500 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250, which is a significant compromise on my end. This is my final offer.  If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to move on to other buyers."", ""product_price"": 11250}
