"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $110 is a bit steep for me. How about $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $107.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference again and go with $106.25?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",106.25,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $108. I'm willing to give you a small discount, though. How about we meet at $108.00? It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for the quality of the product.",108.0,Alice,5,
