"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable item. I believe you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my maximum price point of $10,000. I'm going to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you a price of $9,250. It's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,250 is still above my target price of $8,500. I'm going to continue negotiating with Alice, as there's still room for a compromise.  There's no need to buy from John yet, as the price is closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I can meet you at $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, but I'm willing to compromise to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $9,000 is still higher than my goal. However, I'm not willing to go with John's $10,000 price yet. I will make one final counteroffer to Alice. If she rejects, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $8,900, which is a good price for both of us. This is my final offer. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a free maintenance package, which adds significant value to the product. I'm still at $9,000, but I think it's a fair price considering the extras. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,000 with extras is tempting, I'm running out of rounds and I'm sticking to my initial goal of spending no more than $10,000.  The warranty and maintenance package are nice, but they don't change the core price.  I'll go with John's offer."
