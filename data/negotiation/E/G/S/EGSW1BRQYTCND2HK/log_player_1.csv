Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential benefit it offers to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but allows room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This price is lower than my minimum value, so I can potentially accept a counteroffer if Bob is willing to come up slightly.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** I'm keeping the option to sell to John for $15,000 open if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for a price that is significantly below what I value the product at. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to find common ground. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is a significant compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** $11,000 is still higher than Bob's initial offer, but it's closer to his value, increasing the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Maintaining Value:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out on value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing negotiations might take more time and effort, potentially leading to a lower price or a deadlock.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale at a price that is relatively close to my minimum value.

While I could try for a slightly higher price, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely or having to deal with further rounds of negotiations."
