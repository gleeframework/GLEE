"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer of $650,000, but I'm still a bit above that. Considering the value I believe the product holds, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd be willing to sell it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think we're getting close to a deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counter-offer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a little too steep for me. How about $725,000? I think that's a fair price reflecting the value it brings me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but $725,000 is still a bit below my target. Considering the value I believe the product holds, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'd be willing to sell it to you for $775,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm getting closer to a price point where I'm comfortable. How about we split the difference and land at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still a bit above that. Considering the value I believe the product holds, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'd be willing to sell it to you for $760,000. This is as close as I can get to your offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you.",760000.0,Alice,7,
