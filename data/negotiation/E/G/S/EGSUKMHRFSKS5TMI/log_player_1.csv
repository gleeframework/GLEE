{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than your minimum value but significantly lower than Bob's perceived value. This strategy allows for potential negotiation and a higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $120 is a bit high for me. How about $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is higher than John's offer, it's still below what I believe the product is worth to Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which I think is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
