Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, given its potential. I'm asking for $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting with a strong offer aims to secure the highest possible profit from Bob, who values the product significantly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, still well above your minimum. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The message highlights the product's value to Bob and frames the offer as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" creating a sense of desirability. 

By setting the initial price at $12,000, Alice increases her chances of either:

1. **Securing a highly profitable sale with Bob.**
2. **Negotiating down to a price still significantly higher than her alternative with John.**"
