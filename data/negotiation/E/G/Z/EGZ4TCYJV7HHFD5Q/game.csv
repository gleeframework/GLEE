,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around half that. How about we start at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,000,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit. However, $1,500,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about $1,200,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $1,200,000 is still not enough. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This offer represents a significant concession on my part, and it's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit.  What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,5,
