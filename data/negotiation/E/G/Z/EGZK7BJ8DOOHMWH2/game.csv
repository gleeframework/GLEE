"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and allows me to get closer to what the product is worth.  What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,000? It's the highest I can go, but I really want to make a deal with you.",12000.0,Bob,4,
