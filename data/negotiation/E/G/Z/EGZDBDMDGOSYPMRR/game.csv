"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. While I appreciate your interest, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Could you do $17,000?  I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
