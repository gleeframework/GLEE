"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but also leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be willing to negotiate since the product is worth $1,200,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I think I can still get a better deal. I'm confident that I can convince Bob to come up a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still pushing for a price closer to my desired value.  I think this price will be attractive to Bob, as it's still a significant discount from what the product is worth to him."
