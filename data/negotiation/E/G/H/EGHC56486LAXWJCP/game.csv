"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $8000 to you, and I'm still paying more than its value to you. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $9000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9500?  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to the value I'm aiming for.  Let's see if we can make this work!",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your value, but $9500 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $9250. This is a compromise that shows I'm serious about buying, and it's still significantly less than what I'm willing to pay from another seller. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $9400.  This price reflects both of our needs and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can finally close this! ",9400.0,Alice,5,
