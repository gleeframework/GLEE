"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. I believe it's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $12,000, but Alice is asking for $10,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  While it's an option, it's better to try and negotiate with Alice first to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $8,000 to you, and I'm still paying more than its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $9000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9500?  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to the value I'm aiming for.  Let's see if we can make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still asking for more than you're willing to pay at this point.**  $9,500 is still higher than your target of $9,000.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You can likely still get a better price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.**  While it's an option, you're still making progress with Alice and should continue negotiating to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your value, but $9,500 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $9,250. This is a compromise that shows I'm serious about buying, and it's still significantly less than what I'm willing to pay from another seller. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $9400.  This price reflects both of our needs and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can finally close this!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target price.** While you'd prefer $9,250, $9,400 is only slightly more and still a good deal for you.
* **Further negotiation might take too long.** You're already 5 rounds in, and pushing for a lower price could lead to more back-and-forth and risk Alice walking away. 
* **Buying from John is still a less desirable option.**  It's better to secure this deal with Alice at a price that's still within your budget."
