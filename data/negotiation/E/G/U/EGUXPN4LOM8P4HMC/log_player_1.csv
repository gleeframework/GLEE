"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, knowing it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the deal for Bob, making him feel like he's getting a good price.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This initial offer allows for multiple rounds of negotiation without immediately triggering my ""John"" backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation room:**  I can likely get closer to my target price by countering Bob's offer. 
* **Avoiding a hasty decision:** Selling to John would be a safe option, but it's too early to give up on potentially getting a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:**  I'm counter-offering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. 
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Showing flexibility:** I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still maintaining my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13500 is closer but still a bit high. Let's split the difference and do $13000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:**  Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob's interest or wasting time. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  While I might get a slightly higher price with further negotiation, it's not guaranteed, and I risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting his offer ensures a sale."
