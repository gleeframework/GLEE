"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your offer, I'm not quite ready to drop to that price yet. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  This leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let me know your thoughts.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about we meet at $9,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
