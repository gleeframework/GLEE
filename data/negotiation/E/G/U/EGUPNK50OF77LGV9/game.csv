"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. That's still a good price for you, and it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,3,
