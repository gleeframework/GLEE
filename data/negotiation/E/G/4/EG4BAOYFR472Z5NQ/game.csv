"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. Considering your offer of $9,000, I can meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go all the way down to $9,750. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can sell the product to you for $10,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10250.0,Alice,5,
