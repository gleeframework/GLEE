"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product,  $1,750,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly lower than what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a great deal for you considering its value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to get a good price for your product, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and would allow us to close this deal. What do you say?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,350,000 is still too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000. This price is fair considering the product's value and my need to get a good return. Let's close this deal.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
