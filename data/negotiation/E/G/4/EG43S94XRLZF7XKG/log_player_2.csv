Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a slightly lower price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $870,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $870,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob has squeezed out a pretty good deal.  Alice is at her lowest price, and while we could keep negotiating, there's a good chance she'll hold firm.  The risk of further negotiation is that Alice might decide to walk away, leaving Bob to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting the offer is the most prudent choice."
