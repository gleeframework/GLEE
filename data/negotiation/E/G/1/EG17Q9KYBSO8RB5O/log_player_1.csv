Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100.  This gives Bob room to negotiate, while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm confident in the value of the product, and I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to undervalue it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to give in to Bob's first counteroffer. I'm going to see if I can get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counter-offering with $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still looking to get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is only $5 less than my initial offer, and it's a better deal than selling to John. I'm willing to accept it."
