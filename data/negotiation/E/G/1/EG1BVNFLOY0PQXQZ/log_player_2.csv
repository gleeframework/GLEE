"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. It's a great opportunity to get it at a slight discount, considering its value to you is $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good start, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?"", 
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good practice to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than the asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially reaching a price closer to my target.
* **Polite and Interested:**  Maintaining a positive and polite tone is crucial for a successful negotiation. I've expressed my interest in the product while also making it clear that the initial price is not ideal for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and her counteroffer is reasonable. However, I believe there's still a chance to get the price closer to $80.  I'll try to meet her halfway with my next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $82.50?"",
""product_price"": 82.5
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting $82.50, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise and move closer to her price. This shows I'm serious about purchasing the product but still aiming for a good deal.
* **Specific Number:**  Using a specific number like $82.50 makes it seem like a carefully considered offer and might make Alice more likely to accept."
