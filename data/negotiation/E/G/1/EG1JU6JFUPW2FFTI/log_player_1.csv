Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's an offer that aims to maximize your profit while considering Bob's valuation:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,200,000 is fair.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to negotiate from a strong position. Starting high allows you to potentially secure a significantly higher profit. 
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:**  While you know the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, aiming too high (like $2,000,000) could make him immediately disengage. A price of $1,200,000  leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding both your minimum and Bob's perceived value.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is very price-sensitive or dislikes negotiation, you might start with a slightly lower offer (e.g., $1,000,000) to increase the chance of a quick sale.
* **Your Risk Tolerance:**  A higher offer has a higher potential reward but also a higher risk of Bob rejecting it.  
* **Negotiation Skills:**  Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters your initial offer. 

This strategy balances maximizing your potential profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
