"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum of $150. I'm hoping to capitalize on the fact that Bob values the product at $100, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price through negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's above his perceived value, it's still below my minimum. I believe I can get a better price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $160.  This is still above my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation.  I believe this price is attractive enough to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price by continuing negotiations. The time pressure is increasing, but I'm not ready to settle for $130 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm lowering my price to $155. This is now only $5 above my minimum and indicates that I am serious about reaching an agreement. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only four rounds left, the negotiation with Bob is becoming increasingly difficult. Bob's counter-offers are getting closer to my minimum, but they are still below my desired price.  Considering the limited time and the certainty of selling to John for $150, I'm choosing to sell the product to John."
