"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting high, aiming for a price above Bob's perceived value.  This is a strategic move to establish a starting point for negotiations and test Bob's willingness to pay a premium.  It also leaves room for negotiation while still securing a decent profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. Accepting it would be a huge loss.  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe option, I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more profit from Bob.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I can use them to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, acknowledging that Bob is not willing to pay my initial asking price. However, I'm still holding firm above my minimum value of $1,500,000. This counteroffer signals my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below my target. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is tempting, but I'm still confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob. With 6 rounds left, I have room to maneuver and potentially reach a price closer to my desired $1,750,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price again to show flexibility.  While I'm still above my minimum, I'm getting closer to Bob's perceived value.  The goal is to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation and potentially reach a compromise within the next few rounds. I'm also trying to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still a bit lower than I'd like. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. With only 4 rounds left, I still have some leverage, and I believe there's room for further negotiation. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a tempting option, but I want to explore all possibilities before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 3 rounds left, I'm narrowing the gap to encourage Bob to accept a deal.  This counteroffer is a compromise, showing my willingness to meet him halfway.  It's still above my minimum, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in a final agreement. If he rejects this, I'll likely take the deal with John."
