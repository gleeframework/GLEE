"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your budget. It makes more sense to reject and counter-offer, as you have 9 rounds to negotiate a better price. Buying from John right now would be a good deal, but there's a chance you could get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with the maximum price I'm willing to pay. This sets a clear boundary and puts pressure on Alice to come down. It's also the price at which buying from John would be a neutral outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,600,000 is closer to my budget, it's still significantly more than I'm comfortable with. It's worth continuing the negotiation with Alice for a better price.  John is still a solid option, but I'm hopeful we can get closer to my ideal price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm serious about negotiating, but staying well below Alice's current offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not desperate.  The goal is to find a middle ground and close the gap."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my budget, I still have a few rounds left and I believe I can get a better price.  There's a good chance that Alice will continue to drop her price, and buying from John right now would mean missing out on that potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again, but only slightly. This shows I'm committed to a deal, but I'm still cautious about overpaying.  I'm hoping to find a compromise point where we can both agree.  I'm also keeping in mind that I'm approaching the halfway point in the negotiations, and I don't want to stall too long without making progress."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is within my budget and is getting closer to my ideal price. With only 3 rounds left, it's unlikely that I'll be able to negotiate a significantly lower price.  Accepting her offer ensures a deal and saves me the risk of further negotiation failing and being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
