"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know will be extremely valuable to your business. While I can't disclose specifics just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,250,000. This is a significant discount considering the true value, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and might prompt her to come down in price."
