"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product, which holds immense value to both of us. I understand its significance and the potential it holds for you, and I am confident that it will meet and exceed your expectations.

To make this offer even more compelling, I propose to sell the product to you at a special introductory price of $950,000. This represents a significant saving compared to the market value of $1,200,000, and I believe it presents an exceptional buying opportunity for you.

Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. I am here to answer any questions you might have and assist you through the process.

Looking forward to your positive response,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a no-brainer. Alice's offer of $950,000 is significantly less than your $1,200,000 maximum and the $1,200,000 John would charge."
