Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it.  It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, so let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's unique nature to potentially increase its perceived value to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I make it clear I'm open to discussion, leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer. 

**Important Note:**  This is just a starting point.  The actual offer you make will depend on factors like the product's true value, your assessment of Bob's potential interest, and your willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'd like to make a serious offer on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum of $15,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob is interested, he's undervaluing the product.  I can likely get a higher price with further negotiation.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Having John's offer of $15,000 gives me the security to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are unsatisfactory. 

**Next Step:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  However,  $10,000 is quite a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to compromise and come down to $17,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's unique value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it's also lower than my initial price. This shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the product's unique value to justify my price point.
* **Direct Approach:** I'm clear and direct in my counteroffer, leaving no room for ambiguity.

**Important Note:** This is a moderate counteroffer. Depending on how strongly I believe in the product's value and my assessment of Bob's willingness to pay, I could adjust the counteroffer price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to offer $14000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $14,000 is only $1,000 above my absolute minimum of $15,000. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still not a good deal for me. 
* **John's offer provides a safety net:** I can walk away and sell the product to John for $15,000, guaranteeing I meet my minimum.
* **Potential for a higher price:**  I believe that I can still negotiate with Bob to get closer to my desired price of $17,000 or more. 

**Next Step:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price between $14,000 and $17,000, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $14,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to $16,000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer ($17,000) and Bob's current offer ($14,000).  
* **Still Above Minimum:** $16,000 is still above my minimum of $15,000, ensuring I get a good price.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** The message highlights the willingness to meet in the middle, conveying a sense of fairness and openness to negotiation.

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I will strongly consider selling to John for $15,000.  The risk of further negotiation with Bob may not be worth the potential for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $16000. I'd be willing to go up to $15500, but that's as high as I can go. Let's see if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Minimum:** Bob's offer of $15,500 is only $500 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This is a very close margin.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** There's a high risk that further negotiation might lead to a lower price, potentially even below my minimum. 
* **John's Offer as Safety Net:**  I can still sell to John for $15,000, which ensures I meet my minimum. However, accepting Bob's offer secures a slightly higher price and potentially avoids a drawn-out negotiation.

**Conclusion:** While $15,500 is not my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise considering Bob's financial constraints and the potential for further negotiation to result in a lower price. Accepting Bob's offer minimizes risk and ensures a quick sale."
