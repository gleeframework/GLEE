"Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $20000 for it.  It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, so let me know what you think.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'd like to make a serious offer on it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  However,  $10000 is quite a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to compromise and come down to $17000.  This is a fair price considering the product's unique value.  Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to offer $14000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $14000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to $16000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $16000. I'd be willing to go up to $15500, but that's as high as I can go. Let's see if we can meet at this price.",15500.0,Bob,6,
