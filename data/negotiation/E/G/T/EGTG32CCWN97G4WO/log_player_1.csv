Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it at $150 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob will pay a bit more than his perceived value ($100).
* **Strategic Pricing:** $140 is a strong starting point. It's significantly lower than John's offer, potentially enticing Bob, while still leaving room for me to negotiate slightly downward if needed.
* **Positive Messaging:** The message focuses on value rather than just the price, subtly suggesting it might be worth more than Bob initially thinks."
