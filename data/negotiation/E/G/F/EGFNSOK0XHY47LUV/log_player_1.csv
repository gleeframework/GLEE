""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential benefits to you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $1,000,000 (to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  To maximize your profit, you should aim for a price closer to Bob's valuation while leaving him with a perceived gain. 
* **The Offer:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 allows Bob to potentially gain $150,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,350,000) while you secure a profit of $350,000 ($1,350,000 - $1,000,000).

This strategy balances profit maximization with a higher likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
