"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $87.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $87.50 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for. Let's split the difference - how about $86?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",86.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $88. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $88.25. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",88.25,Alice,5,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $87, but I'd like to add a small premium for the product's value. I'll sell it to you for $87.50. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",87.5,Alice,7,
