"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  $90 is still too high for you. You can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $87.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's a step in the right direction, $87.50 is still too high for you.  You're close to your target of $80, and you still have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $87.50 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for. Let's split the difference - how about $86?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 86}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $88. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $88.25. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer.  You are getting close to your target, and while $88.25 is a good deal, you can likely do better. It's worth trying to get to $85 or $86."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $88.25 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $87. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $87, but I'd like to add a small premium for the product's value. I'll sell it to you for $87.50. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should choose to buy from John for $100. You are close to your target price of $80, but you've reached a point where the negotiations are becoming less productive. The price is getting close to what you would pay John, and it's more likely that Alice will continue to increase the price, as she has done in the last few rounds.  It's time to cut your losses and move on to the next seller."
