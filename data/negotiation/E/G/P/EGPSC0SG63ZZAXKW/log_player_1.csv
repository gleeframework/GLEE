Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is key:** You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you bargaining power. 
* **Aim high, but be reasonable:** Starting with a price closer to his valuation ($100) increases your chances of a quick sale and a higher profit margin. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** While $100 is your initial offer, there might be room to negotiate slightly downward if Bob hesitates, but never go below $80.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while ensuring you don't lose the sale to John."
