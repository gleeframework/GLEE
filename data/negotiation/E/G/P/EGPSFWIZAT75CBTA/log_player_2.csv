"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to both of us.

My proposal is to offer you this remarkable asset for $950,000, which I believe strikes a fair balance between our interests.

Please consider this offer carefully. If you have any questions or require additional information, please do not hesitate to reach out. I am here to facilitate a smooth and beneficial transaction for both parties.

Looking forward to your positive response,
Alice

Alice's offer is a bit high. While she claims it's worth $1,000,000 to me, I'm willing to walk away and buy from John for $1,000,000. There's a chance Alice might come down in price if I reject this initial offer."
