Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $10000.  This product is worth $15000 to me, so a price closer to your value is a better deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand that you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is a fair price that still allows you to get a great deal, while also allowing me to earn a reasonable profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
