"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $12000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable item at a discount from its true worth of $15000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $10000.  This product is worth $15000 to me, so a price closer to your value is a better deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11500. This is a fair price that still allows you to get a great deal, while also allowing me to earn a reasonable profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,
