"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $950,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price is fair considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired price range.  There's room for further negotiation to try and get closer to Bob's target price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a good compromise, and we can finalize the deal without either of us needing to walk away."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $887,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is within Bob's budget and a good compromise. It's significantly lower than the initial asking price and a better deal than buying from John. Accepting this offer allows Bob to acquire the product at a reasonable price without risking the deal falling through or having to pay more to John."
