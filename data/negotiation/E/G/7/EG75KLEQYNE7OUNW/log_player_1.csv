Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
