{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob first is strategically sound.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" subtly justifies the high price, even if Bob isn't aware of its full worth to you.
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's level of interest and potential for negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, Alice can adjust her approach in subsequent communication to potentially secure a deal closer to her desired price."
