Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for a special price of $14,000. I believe it would be very valuable to you, and this is a great opportunity to acquire it."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is impossible in a real negotiation, but we can use it to our advantage in this scenario.**  Since we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we need to offer a price significantly lower than $15,000 but still high enough to maximize profit.
* **Starting high gives room for negotiation (if this were a more interactive scenario).** Even if Bob counters your initial offer, you have space to go down while still remaining above your minimum selling price.
* **Highlighting value entices Bob.** By emphasizing the product's value to Bob, you increase the perceived worth, making him more likely to consider the offer. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes a single offer scenario. In a real negotiation, more back-and-forth would likely occur."
