Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product to you for $200. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer matches his maximum valuation, I know I can sell it to John for the same price without further negotiation. It's better to make a sure sale now than risk Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation dragging on."
