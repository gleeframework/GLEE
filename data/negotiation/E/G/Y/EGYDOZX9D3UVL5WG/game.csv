"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you our amazing product! I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $150. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider something closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $85. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $150. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $70?  That's a fair deal for both of us, I think.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your proposal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $82. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to considering other options. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,5,
