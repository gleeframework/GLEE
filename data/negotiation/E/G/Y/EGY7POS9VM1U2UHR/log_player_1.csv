Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:** By starting at $150, we can see how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. His response will give us valuable information for the next step.
* **Alternative Option:** We always have John as a backup buyer at $100, ensuring we won't be forced to accept an offer below our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly below both your minimum price ($100) and his own perceived value ($100).  This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, we signal that we're looking for a better deal while keeping the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. While $80 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $130. This product is genuinely worth it, and I believe you'll be very satisfied with it."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** We're making a significant concession from $150 to $130, showing Bob we're flexible and willing to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** The new price is still comfortably above our minimum acceptable price and allows room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Highlighting Value:** We're reiterating the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits and justifying the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress! Bob is moving closer to our minimum price, but $90 is still under our $100 threshold.  There's a chance we can nudge him a bit further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your negotiation style and I'm keen to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle at $110? That's my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By stating this is our final offer, we're creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to make a decision.
* **Compromise:** $110 represents a fair compromise, meeting Bob in the middle between his offer ($90) and our previous price ($130). 
* **Profitable:**  Importantly, we are still securing a $10 profit over our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Backup Plan:** We retain the option to sell to John for $100 if Bob rejects this offer, minimizing our risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm really looking to keep the price as low as possible. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has finally met our minimum acceptable price of $100. There's no point in further negotiation or risking losing the sale to John.  We've successfully negotiated a deal that benefits both parties."
