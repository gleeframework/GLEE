Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I could sell the product to John for $150, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price increases my potential profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $140 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but might still be tempting compared to not getting the product at all.  
* **Limited Time Offer:**  Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale and avoiding a guaranteed but lower profit from John."
