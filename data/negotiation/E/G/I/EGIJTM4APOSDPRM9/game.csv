"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something you've expressed interest in, and I'm confident it will meet your needs perfectly. I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its value, and I'm open to discussing any concerns you may have. If you decide to pass, I have another buyer lined up at $1,200,000, but I believe this is a great opportunity for you.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
