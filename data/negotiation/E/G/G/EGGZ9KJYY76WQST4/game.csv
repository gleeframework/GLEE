"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the benefits you'll gain from owning this product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me partway there.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $950,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. Let's meet at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to budge a little bit more, but $1,025,000 is still a touch high for me.  Would you consider $975,000?  That's a significant step from my previous offer.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be closer to my target. How about we meet at $1,012,500?",1012500.0,Alice,7,
