"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $14000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price of $15,000.** You need to negotiate a lower price.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer.** This gives you more control over the negotiation and could potentially lead to a better price. 
* **Buying from John right now would be more expensive than trying to negotiate with Alice.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $13500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.
