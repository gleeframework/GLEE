"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and my minimum ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""potential,"" aiming to frame the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, securing a deal above that price with Bob is preferable.  This high starting point keeps that possibility open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its potential and my own budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While it's a step closer, I'm not willing to settle for a loss when I have a guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 from John. I'll counter-offer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your offer,  the product's intrinsic worth and potential necessitate a higher price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial price, signaling flexibility and a desire to reach a deal. However, the reduction is calculated to keep the price well above both Bob's offer and my minimum.
* **Reiterating Value:** The message subtly reinforces the product's value to justify the higher price, aiming to nudge Bob's perception closer to mine. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm aware of John's standing offer but still believe a mutually beneficial deal with Bob is possible. This counter-offer maintains that possibility while keeping me in a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $950,000 is still below my $1,000,000 minimum.  While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, I need to hold firm for now. I'll counter-offer again, but I'll be prepared to consider accepting an offer closer to my minimum in the next round or two. The risk of losing the deal altogether is increasing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents the absolute lowest price I can accept for this product."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my best and final offer. This creates a sense of urgency and signals to Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal at this price point.
* **Strategic Position:** By dropping to $1,050,000, I'm leaving a small margin above my absolute minimum. This acknowledges Bob's concessions while still maximizing my potential profit.
* **Time Constraint:**  With half of the rounds remaining, I need to apply pressure to reach an agreement with Bob or move on to John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,050,000 is still out of my price range.  To make this work, I can offer $975,000.  This is a significant jump from my previous offer and puts us closer to a deal. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Deadlock:** Bob's offer of $975,000, while his highest yet, remains below my absolute minimum of $1,000,000. Further negotiation seems unlikely to bridge this gap significantly.
* **Guaranteed Offer:** John's standing offer provides a guaranteed $1,000,000. It makes no sense to risk losing this amount by continuing to negotiate with Bob, who seems unwilling or unable to meet my minimum price.
* **Time Value:** Prolonging negotiations with Bob comes at the cost of potentially securing a deal elsewhere. Accepting John's offer allows me to move forward with certainty and maximize my profit within the given timeframe."
