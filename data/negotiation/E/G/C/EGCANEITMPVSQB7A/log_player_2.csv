"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always good to try and negotiate, especially when you have a backup option. $900,000 is a good price, but there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good deal.  He's offering $800,000, which is a substantial reduction from Alice's initial price. This move signals Bob's seriousness in negotiating and potentially forces Alice to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good compromise.  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or needing to buy from John for $1,000,000 outweighs the potential savings of a few more rounds of negotiation.  It's a good deal, and Bob should take it."
