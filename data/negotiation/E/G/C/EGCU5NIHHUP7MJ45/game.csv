"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $13,000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to get a fair price for my product. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $13,000 is still a bit higher than my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $12,750? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm only $250 away from your offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway there. How about $12,875? I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. ",12875.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're close to your minimum price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $12,500 is a fair price for both of us. Can you consider this offer?",12500.0,Bob,6,
