"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to accommodate your budget.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive from this product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Can we meet in the middle?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $750,000 is still not quite there for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $800,000? This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's make this deal happen.",800000.0,Alice,5,
