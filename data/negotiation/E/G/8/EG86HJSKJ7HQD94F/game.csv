I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great value at a price that's competitive with the market. Would you like to make an offer on the product for $1100000?,1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is a bit pricey, but I believe it's a game-changer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $950000, but I'm willing to meet you closer to your target. I can offer you the product for $1000000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you the product for $990000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",990000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $980000 again, as I think it's a fair price for the product. However, I want to make it clear that I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement",980000.0,Bob,8,
