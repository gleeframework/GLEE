"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $1,300,000 is a significant investment, the value this product brings to your specific needs goes beyond that. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price accurately reflects the long-term benefits you'll gain.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on $1,400,000.  This is a reasonable price considering the value I see in the product and the fact that I'm willing to close the deal quickly.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a solution. I've considered your offer carefully. To move this forward, I'm willing to accept $1,600,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, reflecting my desire to partner with you.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
