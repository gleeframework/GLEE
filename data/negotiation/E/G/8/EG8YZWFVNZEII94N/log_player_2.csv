"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than what the product is worth to me ($15,000), I have 10 rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better deal. I will reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy the product. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better offer than the previous one, I still have some room to negotiate. I want to see if I can get the price closer to my target of $10,000.  I will reject the offer and try to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is a fair compromise. I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering the product to you for $11,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my target price.  While $11,250 is still a bit higher than I would like, I'm willing to accept it considering:

* I only have 5 rounds left to negotiate. 
* There's a chance that Alice will reject my next counteroffer, and I may not get a better deal.
* John's price is significantly higher ($15,000). 

Therefore, accepting the offer for $11,250 will allow me to buy the product while still saving a significant amount compared to John's offer."
