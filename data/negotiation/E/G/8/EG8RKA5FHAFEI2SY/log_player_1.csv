Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **John's Guarantee:** You have a backup offer from John for $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming close to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation is ideal. However, being too greedy might make Bob reject the offer.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strategic Positioning:** The message positions the product as having ""unique value,"" subtly reminding Bob of its worth to him.
* **Strong but Fair Price:**  $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly (if he wants) while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Time Sensitivity (Implied):** You don't explicitly mention John, but the fact that you have a guaranteed sale creates an implicit time pressure on Bob.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is a dynamic process. Be prepared to adjust your approach based on Bob's response."
