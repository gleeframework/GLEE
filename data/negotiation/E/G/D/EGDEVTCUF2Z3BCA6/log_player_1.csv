"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum price of $1,500,000. This shows good faith and demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room:** I'm leaving room for counteroffers, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000. There's enough space for us to find a mutually beneficial price. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to create a friendly atmosphere for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even below Bob's own valuation of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I still have 8 rounds left, so there's plenty of time to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially reach a better price.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, I'm not desperate to sell yet.  I want to see if I can get closer to my minimum price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm offering $1,300,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reinforce the fact that my offer is still fair.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using language like ""great deal"" and ""meet in the middle"" to maintain a positive and collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we split the difference and do $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob is getting closer, $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and also lower than Bob's own valuation of $1,200,000.
* **More rounds to negotiate:** I have 6 rounds remaining to see if I can reach a more favorable price. 
* **John is a strong backup:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a very good option, but I want to explore if I can get a price closer to that with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet halfway again at $1,250,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm again suggesting to meet halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price point.
* **Positive and Motivational:** I'm using positive language and an encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been great to work with, but I have a hard limit on my budget. I can do $1,200,000 for this.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at his valuation:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is his maximum, and he's stated it's his final offer. This means there is no room for further negotiation on his end.
* **Risk of losing time:**  Rejecting this offer and continuing negotiation risks losing valuable time.  We're already on round 6, and the deadline for the deal is only 10 rounds. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $1,500,000. This is a safe and lucrative option that eliminates the risk of a further negotiation breakdown with Bob.

It's important to be willing to walk away from deals, especially when there's a reliable alternative offer available. In this case, the certainty of John's offer outweighs the potential of a slightly higher price from Bob."
