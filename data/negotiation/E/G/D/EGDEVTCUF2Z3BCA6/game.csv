,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we split the difference and do $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet halfway again at $1,250,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's make this happen!",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been great to work with, but I have a hard limit on my budget. I can do $1,200,000 for this.  This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
