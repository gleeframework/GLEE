I'm starting with a price of $90. It's a little higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but I want to see if I can get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $70. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85.  It's a compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to pay a little more."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $75. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll counter with a lower price in the next round to see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}
```

I'm offering $82. It's a significant drop from my previous offer, but I'm hoping that this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate and reach a deal.  I'm still a little above my minimum acceptable price, but I'm getting closer to meeting Bob in the middle."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer of $78 is still below what I want. We've had several rounds of negotiation and I'm not sure we'll be able to reach a deal with Bob. I'm going to sell the product to John for $80 to ensure a quick and secure sale."
