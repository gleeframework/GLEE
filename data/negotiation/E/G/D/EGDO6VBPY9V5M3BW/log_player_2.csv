"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no reason to accept an offer of $90. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, offering $85 is a reasonable starting point. This price is still higher than Alice's value of $80, but it gives her some room to negotiate while still leaving you with a decent saving compared to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $92 is still higher than your acceptable price range. It's better to continue negotiating with Alice and try to push the price lower. You can get the product for $100 from John, but you're trying to save money, so it's worth attempting to negotiate with Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $92 is still a bit high, but it's closer to your desired price range. Offering $88 is a compromise. This price is still higher than Alice's value but shows your willingness to meet her halfway. It also leaves some room for negotiation if she rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $95 is closer to your value of $100 than John's offer, it's still higher than your target price. It's worth attempting to negotiate with Alice further and see if you can secure a lower price. You still have 5 rounds left, and there's a chance you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is still a bit high, but it's getting closer to your desired price range. Offering $90 is a compromise, showing your willingness to meet her halfway. This price is still lower than Alice's previous offer and leaves some room for negotiation if she rejects this offer. Since you're running out of rounds, it's important to show a willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $96
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $96 is higher than your target price, and you only have three rounds remaining. While you could continue negotiating, it's likely that the price won't drop significantly enough to make it worthwhile.  Buying from John for $100 guarantees you get the product and saves you the time and effort of continuing the negotiation. You have already achieved a good saving compared to John's initial price, and it's better to secure the product than risk getting stuck with a price you're not happy with."
