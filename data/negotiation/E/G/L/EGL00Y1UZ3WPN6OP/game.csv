"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we aim for $950,000? This would allow us to both save some money.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However,  $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This would still give you a significant savings, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work. What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in my product.  While $960,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there yet. Let's aim for $970,000. This would still represent a significant savings for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.  Let's see if we can make this work.",970000.0,Alice,5,
