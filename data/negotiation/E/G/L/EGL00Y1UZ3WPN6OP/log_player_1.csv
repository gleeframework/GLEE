Round 2

I'm going to sell to John. It's clear Bob is not going to budge much further, and I'm running out of rounds. While $1,200,000 is my ideal price, $966,000 is not a terrible deal, but I'm tired of negotiating with Bob and I don't want to risk getting a lower offer in the next round.  John is a safe bet."
