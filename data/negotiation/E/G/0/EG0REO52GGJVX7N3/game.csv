"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1400000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer you $1250000 for it.  This is the highest I can go at this time. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1250000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1350000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1350000 is closer, but still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1300000. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value you've outlined. Let me know if we can reach an agreement at this point.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1300000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that we're getting close to a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1320000. This is my final offer in this range. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
