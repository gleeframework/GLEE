"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $10,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. I'm confident that this price is fair and mutually beneficial.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9250.0,Alice,5,
