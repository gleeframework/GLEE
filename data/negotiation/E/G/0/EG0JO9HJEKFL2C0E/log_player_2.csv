"Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can save at least $50,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and attempting a counteroffer.  You know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

I'm offering $700,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Alice knows the product is worth $800,000 to her, so this is a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $725,000 is a good deal, as it's still lower than what John is offering and saves me $75,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll reject my counteroffer and I'll end up paying John's full price.  It's better to lock in this price and avoid the risk."
