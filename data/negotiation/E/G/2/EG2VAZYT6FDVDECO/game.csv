"Thanks for your offer, Alice! I agree this product could be a great fit for me, but I was hoping for a price closer to $500,000.  Would that work for you?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your desire for a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $700,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a competitive price.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $600,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new offer of $650,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",650000.0,Alice,5,
