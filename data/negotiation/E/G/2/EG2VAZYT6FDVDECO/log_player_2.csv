# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your desire for a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $600,000 is still a bit too low for me.
