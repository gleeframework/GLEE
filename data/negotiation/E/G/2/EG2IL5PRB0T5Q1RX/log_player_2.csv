"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is slightly better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $120.  Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $120 is the best option."
