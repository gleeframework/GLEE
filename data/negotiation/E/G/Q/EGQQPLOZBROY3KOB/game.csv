"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $8,500? That's still a good deal for you, as it's less than what the product is worth to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,250 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? This way we both get a fair price and can close the deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
