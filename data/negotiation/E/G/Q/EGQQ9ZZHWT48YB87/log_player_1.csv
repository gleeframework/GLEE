Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with an ambitious offer of $1,800,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  It's a strong starting point to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price and I don't want to risk losing this sale.  It's better to secure the deal now than to potentially negotiate further and risk either ending up with a lower price or losing Bob entirely."
