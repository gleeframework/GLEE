"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to get the best possible deal. I'm willing to offer you $950000 for the product. This is a significant discount from your initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value I place on this item. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your offer. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a reasonable compromise that I believe reflects the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for the product. This is a final offer from my side, and I think it's a fair price considering the value I place on this item. Let's seal the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1000000. I'm still holding out for a better price. Considering our previous negotiations, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1030000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1030000.0,Alice,5,
