"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. With that being said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price by making a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to get the best possible deal. I'm willing to offer you $950,000 for the product.

Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your offer. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a reasonable compromise that I believe reflects the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's desired price point.  While it is tempting to buy from Alice as it is only $50,000 more than John's offer, there is still room for negotiation. Bob can try to bring the price down further by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is a final offer from my side, and I think it's a fair price considering the value I place on this item. Let's seal the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1000000. I'm still holding out for a better price. Considering our previous negotiations, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1030000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $1,030,000, Bob is still better off buying the product from John for $1,000,000.  The potential gains from further negotiation are minimal and it's not worth risking Alice rejecting the offer again. It's better to secure the product at a known price from John."
