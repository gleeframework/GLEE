"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident it will bring you significant value.  How about we split the difference and go with $850,000?  This price still allows you to make a substantial profit, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable value."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $825,000? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Accepting this offer ensures a successful sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
