"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm confident it will bring you significant value.  How about we split the difference and go with $850,000?  This price still allows you to make a substantial profit, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable value.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $825,000? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",825000.0,Bob,4,
