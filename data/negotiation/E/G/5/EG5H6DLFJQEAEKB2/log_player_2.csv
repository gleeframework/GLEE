"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'd really value.  I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $120 is less than $150, so accepting Alice's offer saves you money.
* **The product is worth more to you than Alice:**  You value the product at $150, and Alice is willing to sell it for $120. This means you're getting a good deal."
