"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $85? I'm really interested in the product.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $85 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? I'm confident this product will be worth it to you.",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $87.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's meet in the middle at $86.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",86.0,Bob,4,
