{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90, which is slightly above the value Bob has assigned to the product. This gives me some room to negotiate while still making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $85? I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get a better price. While $85 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can push for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $85 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? I'm confident this product will be worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 87.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $87.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's meet in the middle at $86.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $86. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a fair deal that's above my minimum value. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale altogether, and at this point, it's not worth the risk of a counteroffer."
