"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,600,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  However, $1,300,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This price still reflects the value you'll gain from the product, and it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested in continuing the discussion.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,450,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,350,000. Would that work for you?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for $1,350,000.  To be honest, that's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of this product for you. Let me know your decision, as I'm also considering another offer.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
