{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1,600,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, giving him room to counteroffer.  It also highlights the value proposition, emphasizing its worth to him.  This sets the stage for a potential win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,600,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is still above my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that much lower than my initial offer.  I want to try to get closer to my target price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  However, $1,300,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This price still reflects the value you'll gain from the product, and it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested in continuing the discussion."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,450,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,350,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I want to try and get closer to my target price.  Rejecting this offer gives me the opportunity to make a final counteroffer before potentially selling to John."
