Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 at this time. This represents my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. Considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1250000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget.  You can likely negotiate further, especially since she's already lowered the price.  Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1100000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1150000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. I believe it's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?

```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still a bit higher than your budget. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting allows you to make another counteroffer to try and get a better price. You could potentially buy the product from John at this point, but there's still a chance to get a better deal with Alice."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  $1,120,000 is very close to my budget, but I can only go up to $1,100,000.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1100000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're in the 9th round, and Alice is only willing to come down to $1,105,000. While this is a good price, it's still slightly above your budget.  You've already spent several rounds negotiating, and there's only one round left.  It's likely that further negotiation won't get you a significantly better price. Buying from John for $1,000,000 is a more certain way to secure the product within your budget."
