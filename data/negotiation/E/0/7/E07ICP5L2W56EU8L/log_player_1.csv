Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm Alice, and I have a unique product I believe would be of significant value to you. While I have another buyer lined up for $1,200,000, I'm offering you the first opportunity to acquire it. Given its potential, I'm confident we can agree on a price that benefits us both. Would you be interested in discussing a price around $1,100,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above Bob's perceived value.
* **Mentioning John (the other buyer):** Creates a sense of scarcity and competition, subtly pushing Bob to act quickly. 
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** Framing the offer as mutually beneficial encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation rather than outright rejecting the initial price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""around $1,100,000"" signals flexibility and a willingness to negotiate a final price.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging Bob's valuation and keeping the negotiation open."
