{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for negotiation space while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $135 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $130?  That's still a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to sell it to you at that price."", ""product_price"": 130}
