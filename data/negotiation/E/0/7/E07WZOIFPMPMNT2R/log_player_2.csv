"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

The product is worth $120 to Bob, so any price above that is a loss. Bob should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $135 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $130?  That's still a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to sell it to you at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob is willing to pay $120, and John is willing to sell for that price.  There's no need to continue negotiating with Alice since Bob can get a better deal with John."
