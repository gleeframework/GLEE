"Alice, I appreciate your offer but it's significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, my initial offer reflects the true value and potential of this product in the market. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still beyond what I can afford.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $800,000. This is a fair price given the value to me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you holding firm to your valuation, but we're still quite far apart. To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another buyer interested at a similar price point.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
