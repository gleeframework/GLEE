"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and suggesting a ""great deal"" to appeal to Bob's sense of getting a good price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers and continuing the negotiation. 
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a backup buyer at $15,000 gives me a strong fallback option if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** I need at least $15,000 for this product. 
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my minimum and potentially get a better deal. 
* **John is still a viable option:**  If negotiations with Bob continue to stall, I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a great price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a counter-price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain a Profit:**  $13,500 is still above my minimum of $15,000, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to nudge him towards a higher price.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:**  I'm using ""let's meet in the middle"" to suggest I'm open to further negotiations but not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down. $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  This is a fair price that's within our budgets.  Let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, $13,000 is still below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I believe I can still push for a better price, especially since Bob is clearly interested in the product.
* **John is a Secure Backup:** If negotiations fall through, I have John as a reliable alternative buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $13,000 is still a bit low for me.  Considering the product's value and our ongoing negotiations, I'm willing to drop to $13,750. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm making a small concession to show flexibility, but still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Emphasize Compromise:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to see it as a reasonable offer.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm expressing a desire to reach an agreement to incentivize Bob to accept the offer.
* **John is still a Backup:**  John's offer remains a safety net if negotiations break down."
