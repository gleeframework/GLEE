"I understand you've made a serious offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. Considering the product's value to me is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1050000. Considering the product's value to me is still $1500000, I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. My counteroffer is $1200000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
