"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $10,000.  He's willing to pay up to $12,000, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see that you're a serious buyer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer you a compromise at $10500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still higher than what Bob is hoping for.  He has room to negotiate further, trying to bring the price down closer to $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you need to make a profit, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my bottom line. I can offer you the product for $11000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has come down significantly from her initial price.  While $11,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, it's still a good deal considering the product's worth to Bob ($12,000) and the fact that John is selling it for that price. Accepting the offer saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John."
