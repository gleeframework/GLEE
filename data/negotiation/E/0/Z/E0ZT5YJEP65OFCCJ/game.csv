"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, but I'm not quite ready to go as low as $100. Can we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make a slight concession. I can meet you at $107, which is just a bit above your original offer. It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",107.0,Alice,5,
