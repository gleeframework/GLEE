I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I'm curious to see how Bob values the product and where he's willing to start his counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves a bit of room for negotiation.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a little from his offer."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's only slightly above my minimum,  I'm  satisfied with the outcome, and I'd rather not risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
