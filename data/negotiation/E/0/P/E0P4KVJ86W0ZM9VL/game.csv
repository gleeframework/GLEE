"Alice, $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in your product, but I can only go up to $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $125.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to meet you at $95.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $95, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $130 for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $127.50?",127.5,Alice,5,
