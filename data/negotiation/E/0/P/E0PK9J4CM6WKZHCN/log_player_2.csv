"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs and valued at $120 by you. Considering its high quality and the benefits it offers, I propose we keep the price at $120 to ensure a fair transaction. This ensures you receive the best value for your investment while allowing me to maintain the integrity of our pricing strategy. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and John is offering the product for the same price as Alice, buying from John makes sense. You're not gaining anything by accepting Alice's offer, and you're not losing anything by rejecting it."
