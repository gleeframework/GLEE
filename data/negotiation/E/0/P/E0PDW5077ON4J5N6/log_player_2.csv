You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $90.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $88.5

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88.5

Alice is offering $88.50, which is still below your $100 limit and closer to your desired price. Accepting is the best option in this scenario."
