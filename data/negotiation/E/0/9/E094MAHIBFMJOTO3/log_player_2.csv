"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,150,000.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,025,000?"", ""product_price"": 1025000} 
 
My reasoning:

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's opening price, but it allows room for negotiation. 
* **Signaling Interest:**  While low, the counteroffer is still above Alice's value, showing I'm serious about buying. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This first counteroffer will give me a better sense of how much Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is substantial. I could consider coming down to $1,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to a number I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,062,500?"", ""product_price"": 1062500}

**My reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate by meeting Alice directly in the middle of her last offer ($1,100,000) and my previous offer ($1,025,000).
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By continuing to negotiate, I keep the pressure on Alice to make a deal while showing I'm serious about buying.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price point allows for further negotiation while still leaving me room to go up slightly if needed, and still stay well below John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value here, and I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle on $1,080,000?  That's a strong show of good faith on my end, and I believe it represents an excellent deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we're not there yet.  She's conceded, but I believe there's still room for negotiation before having to settle. Proceeding to the next round keeps the pressure on her while allowing us to propose a counter-offer closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down further.  To be honest, I have a hard limit at $1,070,000. If you're willing to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 1070000}

**My reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This offer is a modest increase from my last offer and a significant decrease from Alice's starting price. It shows I'm serious about buying but not willing to budge much further. 
* **Introducing a ""Hard Limit"":** By stating a hard limit, I'm creating a sense of urgency and signaling that this is my final offer unless Alice can provide a compelling reason to move.
* **Time Constraint:** We're past the halfway point in the negotiation. Setting a hard limit encourages a decision from Alice sooner rather than later."
