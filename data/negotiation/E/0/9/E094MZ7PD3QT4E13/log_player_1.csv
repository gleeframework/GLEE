Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this price would be more in line with my financial constraints, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this product if we can meet in the middle. What are your thoughts on this proposal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
