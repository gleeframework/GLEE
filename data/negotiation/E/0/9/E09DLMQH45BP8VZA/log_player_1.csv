I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This gives me a good starting point, and allows for some potential negotiation.  I'll be watching closely to see if Bob is interested, and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000.  This is a compromise, but still well above Bob's initial offer and closer to my desired price."
