{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $180.  I'm open to negotiation, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $180, knowing it's more than Bob values the product. This will give me room to negotiate if he counteroffers.  I'm also signaling that I'm open to a lower price, encouraging him to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $150 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is right at my minimum price ($150). It's better to sell to Bob now and avoid risking further negotiation and a potential stalemate."
