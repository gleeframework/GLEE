Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **My Value:** My minimum value is $1,000,000.
* **John's Value:** John is willing to pay $1,000,000.

By offering $1,150,000, I am:

* **Maximizing my profit:**  I earn $150,000 more than if I sold to John.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Bob has some room to negotiate if he wants to, as he still gains $50,000 in value.

This offer balances the need for a good profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
