"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product that I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its worth to you, I am offering it at a special price of $11,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering its actual value to you is $12,000. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further or making an offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or sticking with your backup plan of buying from John and saving $1,000."
