"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I see your point about the market value.  However, $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, considering your enthusiasm for the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000, which is the minimum I can accept.  This is a fair price considering the value and potential of this product.  Let's close this deal!",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I think I can do a bit better than that. How about $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,6,
