"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $14,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems like we both see the value in this product.  While $11,500 is a bit too low, I'm willing to come down slightly to $12,500. This feels like a fair compromise.  What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,6,
