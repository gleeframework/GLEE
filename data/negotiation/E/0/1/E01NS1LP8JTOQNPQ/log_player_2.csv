"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer in its field and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1800000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is my maximum budget for this purchase."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high. I'll reject and counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my financial limits."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $950000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1300000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the value you're placing on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my budget.  While there's a chance she might come down further, it's getting risky to continue negotiating. I'm going to buy the product from John for $800,000 to guarantee a good deal."
