"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer in its field and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1800000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1800000 is significantly above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum budget for this purchase.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my financial limits.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $950000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1300000. This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the value you're placing on it.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
