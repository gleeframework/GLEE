"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $13,000 isn't a terrible price, there's room for negotiation. Alice is starting high, and I have some leverage knowing I can buy it from John for $15,000. I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still above her value. This leaves room for negotiation and tests her willingness to move. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:** My message aims to keep the negotiation amicable while expressing my interest. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By countering at $10,500, I'm aiming for a price closer to Alice's value while leaving myself space to negotiate upwards, if needed, before reaching my $15,000 walk-away point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,750? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but she's still trying to anchor the price relatively high.  Splitting the difference might seem fair on the surface, but it still gives her a significant profit margin. I'm willing to push a bit further to see if I can get closer to $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,200? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 11200
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this round ($550 down from $11,750) to signal that I'm getting closer to my limit.
* **Seeking Compromise:** My message still emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable solution while nudging the price down.
* **Staying Above Value:** I'm staying above Alice's $10,000 value, increasing the likelihood she'll accept while staying within a reasonable range of my $15,000 limit."
