"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I'm working with a tighter budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $950,000. This offer reflects a substantial discount while acknowledging the product's worth.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  To be honest, $800,000 is the top end of what I can justify spending.  If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal.  If not, I wish you the best in finding another buyer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
