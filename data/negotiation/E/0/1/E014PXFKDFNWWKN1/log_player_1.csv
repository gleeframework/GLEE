"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This price allows for several rounds of negotiation without immediately triggering a ""sell to John"" scenario. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  This price gives me a good starting point to try and maximize my profit while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $7,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While I could sell to John for $8,000, I believe I can get a better price from Bob. 
* **Negotiation is key:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer splits the difference between my initial offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $7,500. 
* **Staying above minimum:** This price remains above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, ensuring I don't lose out on a better deal.
* **Signaling willingness to negotiate:** By offering a compromise, I'm demonstrating a desire to reach an agreement while still maintaining a strong negotiation position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is getting worse:**  His offer of $7,000 is even lower than his previous offer, indicating he's becoming less willing to pay my desired price.
* **Time is running out:** With only 6 rounds left, the potential for securing a better deal from Bob is decreasing.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $8,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. While I hoped for a better deal with Bob, it's important to ensure I don't risk losing out on a certain profit."
