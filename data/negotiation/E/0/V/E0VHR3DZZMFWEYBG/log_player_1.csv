Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows for some room for both of us to benefit from this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,200,000. I'll see if I can get closer to my asking price in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.
