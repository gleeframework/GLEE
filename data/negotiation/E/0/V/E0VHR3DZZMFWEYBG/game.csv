"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows for some room for both of us to benefit from this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This allows for a good margin for both of us.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
