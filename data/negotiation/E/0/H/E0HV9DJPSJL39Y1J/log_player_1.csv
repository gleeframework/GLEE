"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd find it very valuable.  My initial offer is $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a better price.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and encouraging message might make Bob more open to negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** The initial offer isn't too aggressive, giving Bob room to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $9,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **More Room for Negotiation:**  I have 8 rounds remaining. I can try to negotiate a higher price. There's a good chance Bob might be willing to pay more, especially if he sees my commitment to getting a better deal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John for $15,000 is guaranteed, I want to maximize my profit if possible.  There's a chance I could get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000,  considering your budget constraints.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price above my minimum. 
* **Emphasizing Flexibility:** I'm acknowledging his budget limitations and expressing willingness to compromise. This could make him feel like we're working together.
* **Keeping the Negotiation Open:** My counteroffer is not a final price, keeping the door open for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **More Room for Negotiation:** I have 6 rounds remaining. I can continue to negotiate and see if Bob is willing to come up further.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  While selling to John is a safe option, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. There's a chance he might be willing to go higher to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500,  which is a fair compromise.  Let's finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm making a small concession, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Urgency:**  I'm trying to create a sense of urgency by suggesting we finalize the deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  A positive and encouraging message could help to push Bob towards accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. Given my financial situation, I would like to propose a final offer of $10,200 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Even though Bob's offer is close, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited Rounds:**  I have only 4 rounds remaining.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob increases.
* **Potential for a Better Deal with John:**  Selling to John is guaranteed for a much higher price.  The risk of continuing negotiations with Bob is not worth the potential reward.

**Decision:**  I am going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can close a deal with John for a much higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but unfortunately, I need to get closer to my desired price. Let's try to find common ground. I'm willing to go down to $10,300. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10300}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession to show flexibility, but staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Focusing on Compromise:**  I'm emphasizing finding a solution that works for both of us, hoping to create a sense of partnership.
* **Limited Rounds:** I only have 3 rounds remaining, so I need to make a move to see if Bob will meet me halfway."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a final offer of $10,100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** I only have 2 rounds left. 
* **Bob's Offer is Low:** Even though Bob's offer is close, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Guaranteed Higher Price:**  Selling to John guarantees me a much higher price than I can get from Bob at this point.

**Decision:**  Given the limited time and Bob's low offer, I will sell the product to John for $15,000.  This ensures I get a better price and eliminates the risk of not closing a deal with Bob."
