"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a bit lower than what you're asking, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see something closer to $1,100,000. This price still leaves room for you to profit and is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,100,000, so I'll offer $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a compromise, but $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.  I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal.  Let's settle this and finalize the transaction.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
