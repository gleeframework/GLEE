"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the value of this product is very high.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for less from John, and it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering I can purchase the same product from another seller for $12,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is still a great price considering the value of the product and the opportunity cost of going with another seller.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

It's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You are very close to your ideal price point of $12,000, so it's worth rejecting the offer and sending a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would give us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While $13,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. How about we settle at $13,250? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy with the deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $13,250 is still higher than your target price of $12,000. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for a guaranteed price of $12,000.  You've already successfully negotiated a lower price from Alice, but the potential for further savings is not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially getting stuck with a higher price."
