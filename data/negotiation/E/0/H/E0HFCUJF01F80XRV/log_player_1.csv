Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the value of this product is very high.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the value of the product and frame the offer as beneficial to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to counteroffer.
* **Plan B:**  I can always sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering I can purchase the same product from another seller for $12,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold:**  $12,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting would mean a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Although Bob's offer is low, he's shown willingness to negotiate. A counteroffer might bring him closer to my desired price.
* **John is a backup:**  I can always sell to John for $15,000 if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is still a great price considering the value of the product and the opportunity cost of going with another seller.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $14,000 to $13,500, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the product's value and the opportunity cost of Bob going elsewhere, subtly increasing his perceived value.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message is friendly and invites further discussion, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would give us both a good deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting would mean a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Bob has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate and is getting closer to my desired price. There's still room for another counteroffer.
* **John is a reliable backup:**  If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can always sell to John for $15,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While $13,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. How about we settle at $13,250? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy with the deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $13,500 to $13,250, showing that I'm willing to compromise while still staying above my minimum threshold.
* **Positive Framing:**  I frame the offer as a ""fair compromise"" and highlight the positive outcome for both of us.
* **Avoiding Stalemate:**  I'm trying to bridge the gap and avoid a stalemate that might lead to Bob rejecting my offer again."
