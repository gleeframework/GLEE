"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, close to the middle ground between my minimum value ($8,000) and Bob's estimated value ($15,000). This allows room for negotiation and incentivizes Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a more favorable price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired minimum.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll reject this offer and try to counter with a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it above my minimum. This shows flexibility while demonstrating that I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too low. This counteroffer aims to encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement closer to my ideal range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm again lowering my price, showing flexibility.  However,  $10,500 is still above my minimum and I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good compromise, especially as we're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still lower than I would like.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $9,500, so I'll counteroffer again, hoping to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

This is my final offer.  It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and it's still above my minimum.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I've reached a point where I'm not willing to risk further negotiation.  With only two rounds remaining, there's a high chance he'll reject my next counteroffer, and I'd be stuck selling to John for $8,000 anyway.  Selling to John now ensures I get my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might not yield a better outcome."
