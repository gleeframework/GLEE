"That's a great price, but unfortunately, it's a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $10500 for the product.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,14000.0
"I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid I need to make a bit more than $10500 to make it worth my while. How about $14000?",14000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $14000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $11500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,13000.0
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $11500 is enough for me to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $13000?",13000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference at $12000. That's a fair price, and I'm sure we can finalize the deal.",12000.0,Bob,6,,
