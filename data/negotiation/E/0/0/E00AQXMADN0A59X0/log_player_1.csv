Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm willing to part with it for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I could offer the product at $150 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob will pay a higher price than his perceived value ($80). 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting at $140 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but ensures I get a significant profit even if he accepts the initial offer.
* **Not too high:**  The price is high but not ridiculously so. It might make Bob consider the offer seriously, especially if he thinks the product is worth more than $80."
