"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business operations. Before we proceed, I would like to propose a purchase price of $15000. This reflects not only the value of the product but also the expertise and support we provide to ensure its successful integration into your company. I look forward to discussing this further with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're looking to save as much money as possible, and you have a guaranteed alternative at $15,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer immediately. By rejecting, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your interest in our product. While I'd like to accommodate your budget, I must maintain the integrity of our pricing strategy. Therefore, I am proposing a counteroffer of $14000 for the product. This price still allows us to cover our costs while providing some flexibility within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is closer to your budget, you're still paying more than your initial counteroffer.  There's still room for negotiation, and John's offer provides a safety net if the deal falls apart."
