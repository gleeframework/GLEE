Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $15,000 is a significant amount, but it's not so high that it immediately seems unreasonable. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage. 

**Strategy:**

This opening offer sets the stage for a potential negotiation. If Bob counters, I'll assess his offer and decide whether to accept, counter with a new price, or walk away and sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob is offering the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($10,000). 
* **No Room for Improvement:**  I don't expect to get a better offer from Bob.
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob would take more time and effort.  

**Conclusion:**  It's more efficient to accept Bob's offer and move on."
