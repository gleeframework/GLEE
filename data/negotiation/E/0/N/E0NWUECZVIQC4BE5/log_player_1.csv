Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for bargaining and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product at $150 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price, while still ensuring you get more than your minimum of $100.
* **Confidence and Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to justify the higher price and instill confidence in Bob. 

Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you have the security of John as a backup buyer at your desired minimum price."
