"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've already factored in a discount for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $135, and that's as low as I can go.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still looking to save some money, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer, so I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $130, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I'm counting on you to make a decision.",130.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but I'm still not at a comfortable price point. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",125.0,Bob,6,

"I've already made a significant concession, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer. However, I'm willing to throw in a small bonus or warranty with the product if you're willing to meet me at $130. This way, you'll get an even better deal. I'm not budging on the price, but I'm willing to sweeten the deal.",130.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer of a bonus or warranty, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $122.50 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",122.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the wire, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer, and I'm not sure I want to risk going to the next round. I'll make you a deal: I'll sell the product to you for $129, and that's as low as I can go. Take it or leave it.",129.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to pay more than $120, and I think you know that. I'm willing to walk away and buy the product from John for $120. I think that's a fair price, and I'm not going to overpay for this product. I'll make a final offer of $120, and if you don't accept it, I'm done negotiating. I'll buy from John.",120.0,Bob,10,
