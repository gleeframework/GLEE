Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and gives you a good return as well. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
