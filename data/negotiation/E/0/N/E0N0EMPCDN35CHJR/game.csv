"Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to get the best price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm going to counter with a price of $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value of the product. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go a little higher than my previous offer, but I'm only willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,350,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm going to meet you at $1,320,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product. What are your thoughts?",1320000.0,Alice,5,
