"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is less than Alice's value of $1,500,000, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, as there's potential to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price. Since he knows John will sell the product for $1,000,000, this is Bob's initial counteroffer. It's a bold move, but it establishes a clear target price and might prompt Alice to consider a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down slightly, her offer is still above Bob's budget.  There's room for further negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increased his offer from $1,000,000 to $1,100,000, showing a willingness to compromise.  This offer is still within his budget, and it might be enticing enough for Alice to accept, especially if she wants to close the deal quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still too high for Bob.  With only 5 rounds remaining, the negotiation isn't progressing quickly enough. It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to budge significantly, and Bob is better off securing the product from John at his guaranteed price of $1,000,000. This ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation delays."
