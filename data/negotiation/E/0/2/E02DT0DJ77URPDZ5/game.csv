"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a competitive price.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and I'm keen on reaching a deal that works for both of us. While $1,700,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to finding a compromise. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,5,
