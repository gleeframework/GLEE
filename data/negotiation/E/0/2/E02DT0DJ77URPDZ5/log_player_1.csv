""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident that this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 
We're still significantly above John's offer, so there's room to negotiate. Let's counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a competitive price."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

We're getting close to John's offer, but I think we can still push for a bit more. Bob is showing consistent interest and willingness to negotiate. Let's see if we can get him closer to $1,800,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and I'm keen on reaching a deal that works for both of us. While $1,700,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to finding a compromise. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's time to cut our losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000."
