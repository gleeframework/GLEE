Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll gauge his interest level from his counteroffer and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm going to reject it and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still keeping it significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer. I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000 without further negotiation, so I'll try to push him a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway.  If he rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John and cut my losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I've already lowered my price significantly.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and I'm confident I can sell to John for a better price."
