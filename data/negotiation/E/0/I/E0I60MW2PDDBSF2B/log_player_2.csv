Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and your interest, I propose a price of $9,500 for it. This is a special offer tailored to your needs, considering its worth to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. There are rounds left, and you can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the effort, $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product and your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $9,200. This is my best offer based on the product's worth and your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,200 is within my budget and is a good deal considering my initial goal was to spend no more than $10,000.  While I could potentially negotiate further, there is a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer and the deal could fall through. It's better to accept this offer and secure the product."
