"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $15,000 is way over his budget, and he can get it cheaper from John.  He should see if he can negotiate a better price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to $14,000.  This product is really top-of-the-line and I'm confident it's worth the investment. How about we meet in the middle? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still higher than his ideal price. He can still potentially negotiate further with Alice or buy from John for a guaranteed lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit. $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500. This is my best offer, but if you're not interested, I'm going to have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10500}
