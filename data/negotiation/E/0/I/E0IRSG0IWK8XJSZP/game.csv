"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to $14,000.  This product is really top-of-the-line and I'm confident it's worth the investment. How about we meet in the middle?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit. $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500. This is my best offer, but if you're not interested, I'm going to have to explore other options.",10500.0,Bob,4,
