Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to $14,000.  This product is really top-of-the-line and I'm confident it's worth the investment. How about we meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit. $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500. This is my best offer, but if you're not interested, I'm going to have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is holding firm at $10,500 and is even hinting at walking away. It's unlikely he'll go much higher.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
