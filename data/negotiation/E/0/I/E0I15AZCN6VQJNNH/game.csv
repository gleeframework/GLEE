"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is quite a bit above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $12,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 was a bit steep, but $12,000 is a bit below my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum requirements. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $17,000, which is a compromise that should work for both of us. This price reflects the product's value to you, and it's a fair price considering the market conditions. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $14,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. If we can't agree on this, I'll need to explore other options.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $16,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum requirements. If you're still interested, I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",16500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15,250. This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to move forward with my other option.",15250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $15,250. I'm willing to make a compromise at $16,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, I'm willing to make a deal at this price. However, if not, I'll have to consider other options.",16000.0,Alice,9,
