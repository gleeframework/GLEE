Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $115 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still ensuring you make a profit significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:**  Offering a price too close to $120 might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal and could lead to rejection. 

This strategy balances maximizing your potential profit while maintaining a good chance of Bob accepting the offer."
