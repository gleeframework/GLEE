Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $1,300,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, especially considering its potential worth to you.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Value-Based Pricing:** We know the product is worth significantly more to Bob ($1,500,000) than to you ($800,000). The offer price of $1,300,000 allows both parties to benefit significantly from the transaction.
* **Alternative Option:**  While you have John as a backup buyer, aiming high with Bob first is strategically advantageous. 

This offer balances maximizing profit with a reasonable chance of acceptance from Bob."
