{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will be interested in the product at this price, and we can work towards a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob or I can sell to John for a better price.  I will counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $1,200,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to sell to John for $1,500,000, this is a reasonable outcome and I can secure a sale without further negotiation."
