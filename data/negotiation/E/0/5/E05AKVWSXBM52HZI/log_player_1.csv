{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,300,000. This is a starting point for our conversation, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request, Alice. After evaluating the value of the product, I believe we can reach a fair agreement. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to negotiate, accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. Would you be willing to consider $2,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, and I appreciate your perspective. I am still keen on finding a middle ground. Let me propose a price of $1,600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is now getting closer to my minimum price, but I still have room to negotiate. I'll reject this offer and propose a price closer to $1.8 million to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer to what I had in mind.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. Would you consider $1,850,000?"",
""product_price"": 1850000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I am willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is moving closer to my desired price point, and at $1,700,000, the offer is significantly higher than John's standing offer of $1,500,000. It's a strong offer and accepting avoids the risk of pushing Bob away in further negotiation rounds."
