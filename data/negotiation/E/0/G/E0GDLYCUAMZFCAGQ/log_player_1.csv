I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Aiming for a higher price gives me the best chance of earning more than my minimum.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm starting high, knowing Bob might counteroffer. This allows for a back-and-forth to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Safety Net:**  If Bob rejects, I still have John who's willing to pay my minimum, ensuring I don't lose out completely."
