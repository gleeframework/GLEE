"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for you, as you've expressed interest in acquiring it.  While I value the product at a higher amount, I'm willing to negotiate to ensure a mutually beneficial outcome. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can secure the product from John for a lower price."
