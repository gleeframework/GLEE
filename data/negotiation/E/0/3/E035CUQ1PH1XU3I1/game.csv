"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given the product's value, I'm willing to pay $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise, however. I'm confident this product holds substantial value for you.  Let's find a middle ground. I'll accept $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's worth while allowing for a fair profit for both of us. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  This price is fair and allows for a solid profit for you, while still staying within my budget. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
