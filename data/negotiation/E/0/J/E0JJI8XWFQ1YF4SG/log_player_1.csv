"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 but still leaves some room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price and I have 8 more rounds to work with. I'm going to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still within a range that makes it worthwhile for me to keep trying to close a deal with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I have several rounds left and can still potentially get a better deal.  I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to be flexible, but it's still above Bob's last offer. I want to find a middle ground where we can both agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,750 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I have 4 more rounds to negotiate with Bob. I'm going to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm sticking with $12,000. This price is a good compromise â€“ it's higher than Bob's last offer but still within a reasonable range. With only 3 rounds left, I'm hoping Bob will realize that he needs to increase his offer to get a deal."
