Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  However, $850,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $975,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to the value I need. Let's make this happen.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're both committed to finding a fair price.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very beneficial. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Close:** Alice is consistently moving closer to our desired price range. $950,000 is a reasonable compromise.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're already on Round 5, and while we have time, further haggling might not yield significant savings. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a lower price (like $925,000) risks Alice walking away or us running out of rounds. The potential savings at this point are not worth the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at $1,000,000."
