"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which holds significant value for you at $12,000. I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this item at an exclusive price of $9,500. This is a special offer tailored to recognize your interest and commitment. Please let me know if you are interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is lower than John's price of $12,000, it's still significantly higher than your maximum valuation of the product ($12,000) and Alice's value ($8,000). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal."
