"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to your company. It's something that I've been developing for a while, and I'm confident it can make a significant impact on your operations. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a substantial price reduction from its true potential value, and I'm only offering it to you because I believe in the synergy we can achieve. I understand you might need some time to consider this, and I'm open to discussing it further. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly less than John's offer. Accepting this offer saves you money."
