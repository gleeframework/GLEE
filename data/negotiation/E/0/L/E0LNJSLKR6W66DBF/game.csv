"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still unable to meet at $1100000. I would like to propose $1050000 as my maximum offer for the product. I hope this proposal is within your consideration.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1080000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
