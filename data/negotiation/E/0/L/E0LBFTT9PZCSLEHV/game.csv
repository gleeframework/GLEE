"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $20000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $17000. What do you think?",17000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $17000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $18500. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's value.",18500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18500 is still a bit outside my price range. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'd be willing to pay $17500 for the product. This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",17500.0,Bob,4,
