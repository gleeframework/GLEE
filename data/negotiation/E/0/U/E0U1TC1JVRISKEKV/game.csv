"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $700,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to offer you $750,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still hoping to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into it.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $725,000 is still a bit far from where I'm comfortable.  I'm willing to go up to $740,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",740000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm still not ready to accept $740,000. I'm willing to meet you at $735,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to consider. This is a fair compromise that I think we can both live with.",735000.0,Alice,5,
