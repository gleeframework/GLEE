"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $700,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to her ($700,000 vs $800,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer allows for a counteroffer and potentially a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to offer you $750,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still hoping to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still lower than what I'm willing to pay ($725,000 vs. $800,000).  While I could buy from John for $800,000, there's still room to negotiate a better price with Alice.  Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation open."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $725,000 is still a bit far from where I'm comfortable.  I'm willing to go up to $740,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 740000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm still not ready to accept $740,000. I'm willing to meet you at $735,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to consider. This is a fair compromise that I think we can both live with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $735,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $735,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $735,000 is getting closer to my desired price, and it's still significantly lower than buying from John at $800,000. Accepting this offer allows me to save $65,000 and secure the product. There's a chance I could continue negotiating and get a slightly better price, but the risk of Alice walking away or continuing to stall is high.  It's time to finalize the deal."
