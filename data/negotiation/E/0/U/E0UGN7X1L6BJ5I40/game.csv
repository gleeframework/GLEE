"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested, but I'd need to see it at $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll still get a lot of value out of it.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $90 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $87.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $87.50, which would be $88.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great product.",88.5,Alice,5,
