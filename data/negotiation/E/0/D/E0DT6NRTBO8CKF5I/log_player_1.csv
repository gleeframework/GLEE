"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $115.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This creates room for negotiation and leaves the option to lower the price if needed. It also demonstrates that I'm willing to be flexible, which could encourage Bob to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $105 is tempting, I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be very happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you can't go any lower than $110, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. Can you meet me at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my minimum,  $105 is still below it. I'll reject this offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but unfortunately, I can't go lower than $110. This product is truly worth it, and I believe you'll be very satisfied with it.  Let's make this deal happen.  Is $110 still acceptable?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I'm starting to think I can find a better deal elsewhere. Can you meet me at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting late in the negotiation, and Bob is clearly not willing to budge. I'm running the risk of getting stuck with a price below my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120, which is my guaranteed minimum."
