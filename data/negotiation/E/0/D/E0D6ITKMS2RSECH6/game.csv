"Thanks for your interest, Bob! I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. Would you be willing to meet me at this price or is there a range you'd like to discuss?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's value, but $1200000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so how about $1100000? This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value and uniqueness.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $1100000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so how about $1050000?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer, so how about $1075000? This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price for the product's value and uniqueness.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
