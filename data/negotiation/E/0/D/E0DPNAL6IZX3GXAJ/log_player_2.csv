Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

You're starting with a low offer, aiming to get a good deal.  $100 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, and it's a good starting point for negotiation."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 119} 
```

You're making a final push to see if you can get a better deal than John's offer.  You're just $1 away from your maximum price, so this is a risky move.  Alice might accept, or she might reject and go to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

You've tried your best to negotiate with Alice, but it seems like you've reached a stalemate.  With only one round left, it's not worth the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer.  It's better to go with the guaranteed price from John and get the product."
