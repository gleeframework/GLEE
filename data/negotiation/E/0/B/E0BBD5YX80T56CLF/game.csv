"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
