(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to the table. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

While $1,150,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than the price you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price you're offering. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

Alice is getting closer to your desired price point. While $1,125,000 is still higher than your last offer, it's a good deal compared to John's price, and it's unlikely Alice will go any lower. Accepting this offer secures the product at a price you can live with."
