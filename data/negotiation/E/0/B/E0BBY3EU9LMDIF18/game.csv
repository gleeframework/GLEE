"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm really interested in the product, though, and I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price you're offering. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
