"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,100,000 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $975,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can do $1,050,000 for the product. It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to stick to my budget.  My final offer is $1,000,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. That's the best I can do. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for $1,500,000.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
