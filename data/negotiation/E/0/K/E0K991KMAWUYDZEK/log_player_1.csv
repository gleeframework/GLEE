Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below our minimum ($120). 
* **Create Urgency:**  By mentioning a ""special price"" and offering it to Bob ""first,"" we introduce a sense of urgency that might encourage him to accept.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While our initial offer is $110, there's a chance Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle somewhere between $110 and $120. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
