Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping if you could lower the price a bit. I'd be interested in purchasing it for around $14000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'm not desperate and I have a safety net with John's offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,500.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 14500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to counter your offer with $14250. This seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, $14,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and getting closer to my desired price.  I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to sell to John for a lower price."
