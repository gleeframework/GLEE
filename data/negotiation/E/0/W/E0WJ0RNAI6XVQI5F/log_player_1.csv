"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to start by asking for a price higher than the product's worth to Bob.  This is a strong opening position, and it gives me room to negotiate.  I'm confident that I can close the deal with Bob at a price closer to my target, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price through further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,050,000. This is a compromise, as it's lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is getting closer to my target, I still feel like I can get a better deal.  I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to close the deal in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm confident that Bob values the product at this price and will be willing to close the deal to avoid further negotiation. However, if he rejects, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are at round 6, and Bob is offering $980,000. This is very close to my target price, but it's still not enough. At this point, it's becoming more likely that Bob will continue to lowball me, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price I'm not happy with. I'm also running out of rounds, and the pressure is on. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
