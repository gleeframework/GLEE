"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $850,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer. While Alice is willing to meet him halfway, it is still a significant amount more than his ideal price. By continuing to negotiate, he might be able to close the gap further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my original offer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $825,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he'd prefer a lower price, Alice has moved closer to his counteroffer and is likely to stand firm.  At $825,000, he's still saving a substantial amount compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price, and the risk of losing the deal to another buyer or losing valuable time is not worth the potential savings."
