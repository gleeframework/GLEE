"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not comfortable with $90, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we go with $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $85 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $95 is a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $92.50. Can you meet me there?",92.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $92.50 is closer, it's still a little below my minimum. How about we split the difference again and go with $93.75?  This would allow me to cover my costs and give you a great product at a competitive price. What do you say?",93.75,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to go up to $92. I think that's the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me there?",92.0,Bob,8,
