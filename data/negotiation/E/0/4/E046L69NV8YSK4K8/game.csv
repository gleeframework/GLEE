"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,400,000 is a fair reflection of that. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. Can we discuss further?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
