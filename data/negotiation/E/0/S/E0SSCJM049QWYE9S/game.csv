"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiation, $900000 is a bit too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down to $950000 to meet you halfway.  This is a very fair price considering the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $920000.
