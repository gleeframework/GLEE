,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate you reaching out. However, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'd be interested in buying it for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but $130 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $160. Would you be interested in buying the product at that price?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $145. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find a good deal.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to meet you at $155, which is still a good profit for me. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $155 is still a little too much for me. Let's try $150. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us, and it ensures a smooth transaction.  What do you say?",150.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I've thought about it, and I'm willing to meet you at $152. It's a small compromise, but I think it's worth it to close the deal with you. What do you think?",152.0,Alice,7,
