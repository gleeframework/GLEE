Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $615,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you can meet me at this point.

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

At this point, Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate but is firming up her price.  While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, the difference is becoming marginal, and we risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting at $615,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's offer."
