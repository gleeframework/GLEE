Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but considering my budget and the market value, I would like to propose a price of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation and potentially a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to the value I believe this product holds. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,750,000. This allows for some room for both of us to be satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1600000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,600,000 is close to my desired outcome, and I'm not sure how much more I can realistically push for given Bob's budget constraints.  It's better to close the deal now than to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale altogether."
