Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above my minimum price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested. 
* **Secure a Sale:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $120, selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays or complications. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while ensuring I don't lose out on the guaranteed sale to John."
