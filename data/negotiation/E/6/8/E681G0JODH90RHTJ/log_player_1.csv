Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a truly unique and valuable product. While I can't disclose specifics just yet, I assure you it's worth well over $1,500,000 to me.  I'm open to negotiation, but my starting price is $2,000,000.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $1750000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,750,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I want to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1,750,000 is still below what I consider fair for this product.  Let's compromise: I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000.  This would be a win-win situation, as it's closer to your offer while still reflecting the true value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1850000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1700000, but that's my final offer. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're close to a deal, but $1,700,000 just doesn't cover the true value of this product for me. To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $1,775,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit.  Let's find a way to close this deal, and I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 1775000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1775000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1725000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still slightly below my desired price,  it's getting very close to my minimum value.  I've already had five rounds of negotiation, and I'm starting to run out of time.  Accepting his offer is the best way to secure a good deal and avoid the risk of losing the sale altogether."
