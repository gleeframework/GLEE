"Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a truly unique and valuable product. While I can't disclose specifics just yet, I assure you it's worth well over $1500000 to me.  I'm open to negotiation, but my starting price is $2000000.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can find common ground.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $1750000?",1750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1750000 is still below what I consider fair for this product.  Let's compromise: I'm willing to come down to $1850000.  This would be a win-win situation, as it's closer to your offer while still reflecting the true value of the product. What do you think?",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1850000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1700000, but that's my final offer. Can we meet at this price?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close to a deal, but $1700000 just doesn't cover the true value of this product for me. To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $1775000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit.  Let's find a way to close this deal, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",1775000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1775000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1725000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",1725000.0,Bob,6,
