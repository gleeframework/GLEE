"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $90. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While $90 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $70. Would that work for you?",70.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $80, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's a fair price.",80.0,Alice,5,
