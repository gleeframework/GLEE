"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $15000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's budget.  It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $11000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above Bob's preferred price point.  It's worth seeing if a further counteroffer can bring the price down closer to Bob's budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to pay $12,500.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's fair to both of us. "", ""product_price"": 12500}
