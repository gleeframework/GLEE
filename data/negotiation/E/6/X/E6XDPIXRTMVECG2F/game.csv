"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $1080000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $1050000. I hope we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about I offer you the product for $1070000? This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1070000.0,Alice,5,
