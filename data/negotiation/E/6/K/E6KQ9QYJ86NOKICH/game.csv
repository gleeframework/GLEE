"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think a more reasonable price would be $1350000. This way, we can both benefit from the transaction.",1350000.0,Alice,3,,

"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $1350000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $1275000?",1275000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $1275000 is still a bit below my target. How about we meet in the middle again, at $1325000? This is the best I can do.",1325000.0,Alice,5,,
