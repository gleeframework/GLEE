"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm offering it to you for $9,500, a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't accept an offer that undervalues the product so drastically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, I can't go that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $9,000.  This is still a great price for a product you clearly value. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $8,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I am determined to get closer to my goal and believe there is still room for negotiation. I will continue to counteroffer with the aim of securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $8,750, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need $9,250 for this deal to work.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $9,000. That's my final offer. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal for me. While it's still below my ideal price, it's close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to avoid potential further negotiation and ensures a sale. There's a risk of Bob rejecting my next counteroffer, and potentially pushing me to sell to John for $10,000, but it's not worth the gamble.  $9,000 is a good result, and I'm happy to close the deal."
