"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000). This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum of $12,000.  I'm also conscious of the 10 rounds limit and the option to sell to John, so I need to be aggressive but also willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum of $12,000. I have 8 rounds left and the option to sell to John for my minimum, so I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is still a decent amount for Bob, considering he values the product at $12,000. However, it's closer to my minimum and gives me a better chance of getting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is my minimum acceptable price. It's also the price John is willing to pay, so I'm not losing out on any potential profit. There are 6 rounds left, but I'm happy to close the deal now and avoid any further risk of Bob's counteroffers."
