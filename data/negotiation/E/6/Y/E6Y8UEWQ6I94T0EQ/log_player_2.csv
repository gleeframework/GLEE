You should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating further.  The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, meaning there's still room to lower the price."

I am hopeful that this proposal will lead to a satisfactory agreement for both parties. Please let me know if this revised offer meets your expectations.
