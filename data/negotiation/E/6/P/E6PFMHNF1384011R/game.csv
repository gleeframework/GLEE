"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a great price for you, considering you value the product at $1,200,000.  Let's find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,150,000? That's a reasonable compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,150,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that still allows you to make a profit. Let's meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
