Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,150,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that still allows you to make a profit. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $1,250,000.  Since you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, it's more efficient to cut your losses in the negotiation with Alice and go with the guaranteed deal."
