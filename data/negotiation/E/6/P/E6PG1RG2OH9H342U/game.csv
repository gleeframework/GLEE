"Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value. However, this product offers unique advantages that justify a higher price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000.  This reflects its true worth and potential return on investment for you.",1120000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,120,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,090,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and the product's features.",1090000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I acknowledge your perspective on the market, but I believe this product's unique value justifies a slightly higher price. To meet you closer to the middle ground, I propose $1,105,000. This reflects its potential for significant return on your investment.",1105000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,090,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I think $1,095,000 is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the product's features.",1095000.0,Bob,6,
