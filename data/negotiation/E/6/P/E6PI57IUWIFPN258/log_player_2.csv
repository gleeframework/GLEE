"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product, which I value at over $1000000. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. My initial price is $1500000. I believe this is a fair starting point, but I'm open to discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price.  You can use this round to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on this product, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in acquiring the product but would need a price closer to $800,000 to make it work. I'm willing to discuss a compromise, but this is my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 800000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints. While $800000 is far below my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm confident the value this product will bring to your business will justify this investment. Let's compromise on $1150000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still significantly above your maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to your target.  You can use this round to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,150,000 is still outside my price range.  While I recognize the potential of this product, I can't justify that price. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $950000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'm proposing $1050000 as my final offer. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is a lower price than Alice's previous offer, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  Since Alice has stated this is her final offer, you have a few options:

* **Reject and Counteroffer:**  You could try one more counteroffer, perhaps offering $975,000, to see if you can bridge the gap. However, this is risky as Alice may walk away.
* **Buy from John:** This is a safe option, as you are guaranteed to get the product at your maximum budget.  

Since you're risk-averse and there are still rounds left,  rejecting the offer and making a final counteroffer is the best course of action in this scenario."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. While I value the product and see its potential, I'm still constrained by my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is my final offer, as it's the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a small increase from your previous offer, demonstrating your continued interest while staying within a reasonable range. This final counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between your desired price and Alice's final offer. You are essentially taking a calculated risk, hoping that Alice will accept this offer, knowing that you have the backup option of buying from John."
