"Hello Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product, which I value at over $1000000. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. My initial price is $1500000. I believe this is a fair starting point, but I'm open to discussion.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on this product, $1500000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in acquiring the product but would need a price closer to $800000 to make it work. I'm willing to discuss a compromise, but this is my initial offer.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. While $800000 is far below my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm confident the value this product will bring to your business will justify this investment. Let's compromise on $1150000. This is my final offer.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1150000 is still outside my price range.  While I recognize the potential of this product, I can't justify that price. I'm willing to go up to $950000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $950000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'm proposing $1050000 as my final offer. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. While I value the product and see its potential, I'm still constrained by my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975000.  This is my final offer, as it's the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let's make this deal happen.",975000.0,Bob,6,
