This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to maximize my profit while keeping Bob engaged in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to engage in further negotiation with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
