"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a significant savings compared to my original offer. Let's find a middle ground and make this deal work.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,250. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",10250.0,Bob,4,
