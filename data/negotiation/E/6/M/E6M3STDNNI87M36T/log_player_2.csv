Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $11,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This feels like a fair price that reflects the product's worth.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $14,000. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $12,000 price."
