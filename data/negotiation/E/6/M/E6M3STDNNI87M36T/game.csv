"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $20,000 is quite a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  I could do $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  Could you do $17,000? I'm willing to negotiate to find a price that works for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a valuable product, but $17,000 is still pushing my budget.  How about $11,500?  That's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $11,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This feels like a fair price that reflects the product's worth.",14000.0,Alice,5,
