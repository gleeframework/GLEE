"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product.  While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I believe it's worth every penny of the original offer, but I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While I see the value in the product, $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,060,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and also ensures a mutually beneficial outcome.  What are your thoughts?",1060000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your continued interest, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,055,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table.
