"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a very competitive price.  I'm asking for $900,000 for it. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's beneficial for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice is offering the product for $900,000, which is less than John's price of $1,000,000.
* **But, you can do better:** You know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice. This means there's still room for negotiation. You can try to get a lower price.

**Next Steps:**

Since you have a better option with Alice, you should reject her initial offer and try to negotiate a lower price. This strategy could lead to a deal that saves you even more money."
