{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [Product Name] for $15,000. It's in excellent condition and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer.  It also highlights the product's value, potentially making Bob more likely to consider your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value for the product. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your budget.  $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7000, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $7000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $7,000 is still below my minimum value for the product. While I'm happy to negotiate,  I'm not willing to go below my minimum value. Selling to John for $10,000 is a better option at this point."
