"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a valuable product that I believe will be of great interest to you. I'm asking $900000 for it. This is a significant opportunity, but I understand if the price isn't right for you.  I have another buyer lined up at $800000, but I believe this product could be worth even more to someone with your expertise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
