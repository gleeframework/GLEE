{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  He's willing to pay $1,200,000, so this gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to accept no less than $1,500,000, so there's still room for you to increase the price.
* **It's a strong opening:** A clear and concise message with a firm price sets the tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While he's willing to pay a premium, it's not enough for me to consider selling at this point.  It's better to try to negotiate a higher price or, if necessary, sell to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $1,350,000? This would still be a good value for you, and it gives me some breathing room. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the value Bob would still get by paying this price.
* **Openness:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, showing willingness to find a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000? This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  

I'm still confident that I can negotiate a higher price, or alternatively, I can sell to John for $1,500,000.  It's not worth settling for a price that's significantly lower than my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. To make this work, I need to be at $1,400,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's aim for a final deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate, but it's still above Bob's offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to justify my price.
* **Finality:**  I'm signaling that this might be my final offer, pushing Bob to consider it seriously."
