{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so $9,500 gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You won't lose money at this price, and it leaves you some flexibility for counteroffers.
* **It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate:**  By offering a price slightly lower than your minimum, you signal that you're open to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me. While selling to John for $10,000 is always an option, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  My counteroffer of $8,500 is a compromise. It's halfway between my initial offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $7,000.
* **Reasoning:** I want to keep the negotiation moving forward, and I believe this counteroffer is reasonable considering the value of the product. 
* **Positive Messaging:** My message is positive and emphasizes fairness and compromise, aiming to maintain a constructive dialogue with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we split the difference and I'll do $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $7,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $10,000. I am not yet willing to accept a price that results in such a large loss for me. 

I will continue to negotiate with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my desired price, but I am prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $7,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8,125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** My counteroffer of $8,125 is again a compromise, this time the midpoint between my previous offer of $8,500 and Bob's offer of $7,750. 
* **Reasoning:**  I'm aiming to steadily inch closer to my desired price while keeping the negotiation moving.  The small increments show that I'm serious about reaching a deal with Bob.
* **Positive Messaging:** I continue with a positive and encouraging tone, emphasizing fairness and mutual benefit, hoping to keep the negotiation going and avoid an impasse."
