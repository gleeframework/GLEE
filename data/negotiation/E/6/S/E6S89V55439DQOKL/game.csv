"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $850000.  This price is fair and allows for a profitable margin for both of us. I'm eager to finalize this deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $850000 is a significant amount for you, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Considering the value you place on it, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
