Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $850000 is a significant amount for you, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Considering the value you place on it, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.

Alice is moving closer to your desired price, but there's still some room to negotiate. A counteroffer might get you closer to your target.  You've shown you're serious about getting a good deal and Alice seems flexible."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $880000, which is a slight concession from my previous offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $880,000 is within your budget and very close to your desired price. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and you having to buy from John at a much higher price is significant. Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice to secure the product at a good price."
