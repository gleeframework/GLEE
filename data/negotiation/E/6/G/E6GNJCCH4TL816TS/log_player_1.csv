"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This is a strong opening offer that leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is still a good price, but I want to see if I can push for something closer to my initial asking price.  I have 8 rounds left and there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer, but still leaving a margin for further negotiation. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to work with Bob while also preserving some of my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. Even though it's the same as his previous offer, I still have a few rounds left and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,300,000. I'm trying to find a price point that Bob might be willing to accept, but I'm also running out of time and need to get closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and while $1,250,000 isn't my ideal price, it's still a good profit and higher than what I could get from John.  It's time to finalize the deal."
