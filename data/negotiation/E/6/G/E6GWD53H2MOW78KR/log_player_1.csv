Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply that the price is justified, even if it's higher than what Bob might initially have in mind.
* **Alternative Option:** Letting Bob know you have other options (selling to John) creates a sense of urgency and scarcity.

This approach aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a chance to consider a deal that might be appealing."
