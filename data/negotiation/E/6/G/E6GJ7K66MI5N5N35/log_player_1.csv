"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to start negotiations with a strong offer that leaves room for negotiation but is significantly above your minimum acceptable price. This gives you leverage and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the ""unique features and potential"" aims to subtly nudge Bob towards understanding the value you place on the product, even if it's higher than his own valuation.
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in the offer's fairness sets the stage for a potentially smoother negotiation. 

This is a starting point, and the strategy in subsequent rounds will depend heavily on Bob's reactions and counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in the product. While I appreciate the value you see in it, I believe we can reach a more reasonable agreement. Based on my assessment and budget, I would like to propose a purchase price of $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting as it's above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000. I know I have another buyer (John) at $1,500,000, so there's no reason to settle for less. It's early in the negotiation, and I have room to counter and see if Bob will move closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, my valuation for this product is significantly higher than your current offer. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the true value and potential this product holds."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Hold Firm:**  I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate by decreasing my price, but not drastically. This shows Bob I'm serious while still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to subtly encourage Bob to potentially raise his offer closer to my range.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps me well above both Bob's offer and my fallback option with John ($1,500,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering the market value and my financial constraints, I would like to propose a purchase price of $1,700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and his offer is getting closer to my minimum. However, $1,700,000 is still below my fallback option of $1,500,000 with John. I'll counteroffer again, pushing slightly closer to my minimum, but prepared to walk away if he doesn't budge significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,800,000.  However, this is my final offer. I believe it represents a fair compromise, and I'm confident in the value this product will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Signal:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and signaling that I'm nearing my limit.
* **Slight Concession:** Coming down to $1,800,000 shows some flexibility but still keeps me comfortably above my fallback option with John.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm ending on a positive note, emphasizing the product's value proposition to Bob's business.

This is a calculated risk. There's a chance Bob will accept, but if he rejects this offer, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for my guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued cooperation. I've carefully considered our negotiations and would like to propose a purchase price of $1,750,000. This offer aims to find a balance between our respective positions while still staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very slowly approaching my minimum, but it's clear he's unlikely to meet my $1,800,000 final offer.  Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of:

* **Wasting Time and Effort:**  We might spend several more rounds with little progress. 
* **Losing John's Offer:**  There's no guarantee John's offer will remain open indefinitely.

While $1,750,000 is tempting, it's only a small gain over John's guaranteed $1,500,000.  I've already invested time with Bob, and it's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed deal."
