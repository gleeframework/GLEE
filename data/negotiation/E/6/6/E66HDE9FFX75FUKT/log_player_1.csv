Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation that will land us both in a good spot."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

I'm offering $1,850,000.  This is a slight concession from my previous offer, but I'm trying to meet Bob halfway. With only a few rounds left, I need to find a price that's acceptable to both of us."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1775000}
```

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While it's not the price I initially hoped for, accepting Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is the best course of action. I'm only two rounds away from having to sell to John for a lower price, and with Bob's offer I'm still exceeding my minimum value."
