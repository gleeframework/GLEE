"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay above my minimum while giving you a great deal. Let's make this happen!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $8,500. How about we settle on $8,750? That way, I can get the product I want, and you can still make a profit.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but only to $9,250. This is my final offer. If you're serious about acquiring the product, I believe this price is fair.  However, if you can't meet this price, I will unfortunately have to consider other options.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm afraid $9,250 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750, but I'm not going any higher. I'm starting to get concerned that we'll be unable to come to an agreement. Can you really only go down to $9,250?",8750.0,Bob,6,
