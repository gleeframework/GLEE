"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price of $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $110 is less than your maximum budget, you can try to get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. This will lead you to buy from John for $120, but there's a chance Alice might come back with a lower offer to avoid losing the sale."
