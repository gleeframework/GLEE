"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it, but my budget is limited. Could you consider lowering the price to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $10,000. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget is limited, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I still believe $8,000 is a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $8,500 isn't my ideal price, it's closer to my goal than $8,000 and it's above my minimum.  It's better to secure the sale now than risk losing Bob completely and having to settle for John's offer."
