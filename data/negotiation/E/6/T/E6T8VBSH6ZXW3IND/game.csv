"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500 to reflect your budget.  This price still allows me to make a profit, and I believe it's fair considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  I'm trying to stick to a tight budget, would you be willing to meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,250 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,750, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. This is my final offer, I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",11750.0,Alice,5,
