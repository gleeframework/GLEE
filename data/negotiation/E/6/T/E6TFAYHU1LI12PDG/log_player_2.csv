"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $140. It's in great condition and would be a great value for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is close to my maximum but there's still room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. The product looks great, but I was hoping to spend closer to $110. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but realistic:**  Starting with a significantly lower offer ($110) leaves room for negotiation. While it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, it signals that I'm looking for a substantial discount.
* **Polite and positive:**  Maintaining a good rapport can be helpful in negotiations.  The message acknowledges Alice's offer and expresses continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, which is a good sign. While $130 is better than her initial offer, it's still above my target price. I'll counteroffer to keep the negotiation moving in the right direction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** I'm proposing a price directly in the middle of our last two offers ($110 and $130). This shows a willingness to compromise and find a fair solution.
* **Reaching my target:** $120 is the maximum I'm willing to pay, so this offer tests if Alice is truly willing to sell at a price that works for me. 
* **Direct and clear:** The message is concise and gets straight to the point to keep the negotiation efficient."
