"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a product worth a significant amount. I believe it has immense potential value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable asset. My starting price is $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while allowing for a reasonable profit for you. I look forward to your response.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept at this time.  I'm willing to be flexible, however, and I believe a price of $1,100,000 would be fair to both of us. This still leaves significant room for you to profit from the product, and it allows me to achieve my desired return. Let's work together to reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
