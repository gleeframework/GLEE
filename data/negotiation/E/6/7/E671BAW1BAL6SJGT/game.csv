"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price. I'm offering the product for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a price that reflects the product's worth.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to ensure I receive a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to go down to $1,040,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a good deal. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1040000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,040,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,030,000, but I think that's the maximum I can afford. I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",1030000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,030,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,035,000. This is a small compromise on my part, and it allows us to get closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal in the next round.",1035000.0,Alice,7,
