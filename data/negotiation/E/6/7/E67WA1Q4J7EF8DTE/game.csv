"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and well above my minimum.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,350,000 is still a bit below my target. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,375,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still find great value in this product.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I've considered your proposal, Alice. I believe $1,375,000 is still a bit steep for me given my budget. Would you be open to lowering the price by $25,000? That would bring the total to $1,350,000, which I believe is a fair compromise for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
