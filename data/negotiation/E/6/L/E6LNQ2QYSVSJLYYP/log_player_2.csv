Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount of time and resources into this product, and I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll offer it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is now matching John's price. There's no guarantee of getting a better deal in further rounds, so it's best to accept and avoid the risk of losing the product."
