"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $750,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let's see if we can work something out.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit far from meeting my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $725,000. I think this is a fair middle ground that benefits both of us.",725000.0,Alice,3,
