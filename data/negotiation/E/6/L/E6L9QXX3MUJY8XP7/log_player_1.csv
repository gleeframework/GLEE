Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to your maximum. 
* **Appear Reasonable:** While a higher initial offer is tempting, it might scare Bob off. $119 is a strong starting point, showing you're willing to make a deal but also value your product."
