"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$6,000 is a good price, but it's likely Alice is willing to go lower. We can try to negotiate a better price.  There's no reason to buy from John immediately when we have a chance to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a 25% discount from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal. It's also a safe starting point, as it's still well below my maximum budget. I'm hoping Alice will be willing to negotiate from this point, but if not, I can gradually increase my offer in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $5,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still not the best deal possible. I'm confident I can get a lower price with continued negotiation. It's too early to buy from John, as I still have more rounds to try and secure a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate by coming down from her original offer.  I'm increasing my offer slightly to $5,000, demonstrating good faith while still aiming for a price lower than her current offer.  This shows I'm willing to meet halfway, and hopefully will lead to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $5,200, which is a good price considering my initial offer of $4,500.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk she might become less flexible.  At this point, $5,200 is a decent deal and within my budget, so accepting her offer minimizes the risk of not getting a deal at all."
