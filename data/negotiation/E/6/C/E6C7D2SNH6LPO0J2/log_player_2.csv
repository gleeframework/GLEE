"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and more than what I would get from another buyer. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
