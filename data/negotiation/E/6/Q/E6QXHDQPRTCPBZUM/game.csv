"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you say?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I go down to $90?  That's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $87.50. It's a fair price for both of us and we can move on from here.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're eager to get this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $87.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $89.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",89.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $88?  That's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",88.0,Bob,6,
