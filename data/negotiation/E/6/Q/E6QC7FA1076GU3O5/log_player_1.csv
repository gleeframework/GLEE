"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a price close to the middle of our estimated values.
* **Positive framing:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the benefit for Bob. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  Leaving room for negotiation allows us to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Avoiding John:**  $100 is better than the $80 John offers, so I'm focused on getting the best price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Value:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $80.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows interest.  I can use this to potentially push for a higher price in the next round.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is a guaranteed $80,  I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob. 

I will counteroffer with a slightly higher price than Bob's offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me right now.  I'm willing to come down to $90 to make this work.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Show willingness to negotiate:**  My message conveys flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Keep John's offer in mind:**  While $90 is less than my ideal, it's still better than John's offer and provides more room for potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum:**  Bob's offer is now equal to what John is offering.
* **Time is running out:**  We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale.
* **Minimizing risk:**  While I'd prefer to get more from Bob,  I'm choosing to secure the sale with John. There's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further, and I'm running the risk of losing both buyers if I continue to negotiate. 

I'm going to sell to John to ensure I get the minimum I'm willing to accept."
