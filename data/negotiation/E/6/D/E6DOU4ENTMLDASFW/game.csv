"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the value this product brings is truly unique. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth. What do you say?",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,125,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,087,500. This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to make a good deal. Let me know what you think.",1087500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  My absolute bottom line is $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a solution that works for both of us. Please let me know your final decision.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
