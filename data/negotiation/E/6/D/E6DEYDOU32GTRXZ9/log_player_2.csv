"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. This price reflects its potential and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is too high for me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. Since I don't know the value of the product to Alice, I'll start with a relatively low offer and see how she reacts.

{""message"": ""I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $800000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but  $1000000 is my lowest offer. This is a significant opportunity for you and I'm confident the product will generate much more than that in return.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","Alice is still way above my budget, and I'm not convinced that the product is worth $1,000,000 to her. I'll try to negotiate further and see if I can get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to meet Alice halfway, but still keep the price relatively low. I'll offer $900,000, which is $100,000 below her latest offer.

{""message"": ""I understand that the product has value, but I still think $1,000,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
