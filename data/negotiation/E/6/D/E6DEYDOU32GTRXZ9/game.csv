"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. This price reflects its potential and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $800000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $800000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but  $1000000 is my lowest offer. This is a significant opportunity for you and I'm confident the product will generate much more than that in return.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but I still think $1000000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,4,
