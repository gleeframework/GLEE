Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $10,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob is offering $9,500, which is closer to my minimum desired value of $10,000. It's a good compromise, and continuing negotiations might not get me a better price, especially given that I can sell to John for $15,000. It's better to secure the sale and avoid the risk of further rejection or a longer negotiation."
