Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm offering it at a price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, starting high allows room for negotiation and leaves you closer to your minimum acceptable price.
* **Below your guaranteed offer:** Offering it slightly below John's offer ($1,500,000) still ensures a significant profit if Bob accepts.
* **Justification of value:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" aims to frame the price in a positive light, even if it's above Bob's initial perceived value. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:**  Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You have some wiggle room down to $1,500,000 (John's offer) without losing money.
* **Bob's perspective:** Keep in mind that Bob will try to negotiate down from your offer. Having a clear strategy for your responses will be beneficial."
