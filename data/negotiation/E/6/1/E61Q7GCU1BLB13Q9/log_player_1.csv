Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I want to see if I can get Bob to budge a little before selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1400000. How about we meet in the middle at $1300000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is closer to my desired price, I still have some room to negotiate and want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to $1,400,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your concerns, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and I'll come down to $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,250,000 is very close to my minimum, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more and get him to come up to $1,300,000.  I'm confident that I can do this in the next round.  If he rejects my counteroffer again, I'll be more likely to sell to John."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  I've reached my minimum price, but Bob is not willing to meet me in the middle.  I don't want to risk getting into a bidding war with Bob and potentially getting less than John is offering.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
