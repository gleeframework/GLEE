"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but $1300000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and I'll come down to $1350000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
