Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline], after which it will be extended to another interested party."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Deadline for Urgency:**  A deadline creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act before the opportunity is gone.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a secure offer from John at $800,000, so there's no pressure to accept anything less.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring a successful sale."
