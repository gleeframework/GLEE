Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

While Bob might still be willing to negotiate higher than $8,000, there's no guarantee. John provides a guaranteed $8,000 which matches Bob's current offer. It's not worth the risk of Bob going even lower or the negotiation dragging on."
