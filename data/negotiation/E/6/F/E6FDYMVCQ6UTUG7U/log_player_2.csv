"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer, but not too low to be immediately rejected. He's aiming for a price that's closer to his maximum budget, while still leaving room for potential negotiation in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $10500 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $11500. This would still be a good deal for you considering the value you've stated, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let's try to find a compromise here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point.  He has room to negotiate further, and he still has the option of buying from John for $10,000. Rejecting the offer allows him to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he's also being realistic about the value of the product. He's increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he's willing to negotiate, but he's still within his budget. This counteroffer leaves some room for Alice to come down further, making it more likely they can reach an agreement."
