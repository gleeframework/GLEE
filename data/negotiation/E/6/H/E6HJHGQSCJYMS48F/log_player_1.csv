Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than that. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I believe there's still room to get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go that high. I'm willing to meet you at $1,350,000, but that's my final offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Since this is his final offer and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who is willing to pay my desired price, I will choose to sell the product to John."
