,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,350,000? This still leaves room for profit for both of us. Let's find a compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,375,000. This is a fair compromise considering our previous offers. Let's make this deal happen.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
