Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and makes Bob feel like he might get a deal if he negotiates.
* **Knowing Your Worth:** While we know Bob values the product at $120,  he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives the product as valuable or scarce.  
* **Backup Plan:**  We have a safety net with John, ensuring we won't go below our minimum price. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving room for a potential agreement with Bob."
