Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefit it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation while staying well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 provides a safety net.

This strategy balances ambition with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
