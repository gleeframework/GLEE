"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product will be incredibly valuable for you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,200,000. It's a fair deal considering its worth to you, and it gives you significant room for profit. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000). There is room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $950,000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit lower than what I need to make this sale worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still provides you with a considerable profit margin and is closer to what I need to make this transaction worthwhile. Let me know your thoughts.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price point.  Bob can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a price that is more favorable."
