Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'd be willing to pay $950,000. This price is still a substantial profit for you and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.
