"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it brings. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $15,000, Bob can still do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $11250? This price reflects the value of the product while also being fair to both of us.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,250 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still more than what John is offering.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price, potentially even below John's price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10750 is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to be flexible, however.  Let's split the difference again.  I'll accept $11000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to move forward. What do you say?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's latest offer of $11,000 is better than her previous offers, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  Considering Bob has the option of buying the product from John for $10,000, it's more advantageous to go with John's offer and secure the product at the lowest possible price.  Further negotiation with Alice could result in a lower price, but there's no guarantee, and it would involve more back-and-forth.  Therefore, buying from John is the most logical choice in this scenario."
