{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it brings. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value the product brings, making it more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a potential middle ground.
* **Backup Plan:** I'm keeping John in mind as a safety net, ensuring I can still get my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $10500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value. There's still a chance for a higher offer from him.
* **John is the Safety Net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This price reflects the value of the product while also being fair to both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests. 
* **Emphasize Fairness:** I'm highlighting that the new price is fair for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of compromise.
* **Maintain Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation positive and encouraging, aiming to find a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10750, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** Bob's offer of $10,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's closer to my desired value, it's still not worth jeopardizing my potential profit. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** I'm not ready to give up on the negotiation. I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer, especially considering he's already made a concession. 
* **John is the Backup:** If Bob doesn't come up with a more acceptable price, I can always sell to John for $15,000, ensuring my minimum profit."

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:** This counteroffer is a small concession from my previous offer, showing willingness to compromise without sacrificing too much.

* **Direct Language:** This time I'm using more direct language, highlighting the difference in our current positions and emphasizing the need for a compromise to reach an agreement.
