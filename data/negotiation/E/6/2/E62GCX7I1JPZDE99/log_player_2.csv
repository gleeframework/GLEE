"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth exploring if you can get a better deal.  Since you don't know Alice's value, rejecting the offer and seeing if she'll come down gives you more information and a chance to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to start with a relatively aggressive counteroffer.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good price and hopefully prompts her to come down a bit. We'll see if she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but it's still too high.  I'm going to try to get her lower with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm going to split the difference between my last offer and Alice's offer. This shows that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I still want to save some money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my ideal price.  While I could potentially try to squeeze out a little more, accepting this offer will save me $112,500 compared to buying from John.  It's a good compromise and a good deal overall."
