"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a truly unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1250000. This price reflects the potential it holds, and I'm confident you'll see the same value.  Let me know your thoughts!
