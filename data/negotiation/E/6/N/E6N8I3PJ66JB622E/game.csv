"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? This is a great product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",112.5,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to go up to $110, but I'm not sure I can stretch to $112.50. Can we meet in the middle again at $111.25?",111.25,Bob,4,
