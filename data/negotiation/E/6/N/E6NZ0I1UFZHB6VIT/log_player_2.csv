Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $120 is simply too far below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $130 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $150 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $140. This is a good compromise for both of us, and it gives you a better price than you'd get elsewhere.
