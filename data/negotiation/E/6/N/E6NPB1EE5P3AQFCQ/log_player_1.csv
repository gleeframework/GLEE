Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I think we can work out a better deal. How about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
