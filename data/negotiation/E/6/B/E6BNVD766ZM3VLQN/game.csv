"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle at $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I value the product highly, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1600000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a lower offer of $1300000. Can we meet in the middle again?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1300000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering $1400000. This is my final offer.  If you're interested, let's finalize the deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $1400000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a final offer of $1250000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
