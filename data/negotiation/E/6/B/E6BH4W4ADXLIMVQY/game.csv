,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $142.50. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?",142.5,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $143. I think this is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",143.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with $143. I'm willing to pay $141 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",141.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $141. I've already gone above my minimum price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to walk away from this deal if we can't meet in the middle. I'll give you one more chance to reconsider. I'll sell the product to you for $144, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",144.0,Alice,9,
