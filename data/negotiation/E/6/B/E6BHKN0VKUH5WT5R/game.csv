"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price that's in both of our best interests. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,150,000 still falls short of my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,180,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and I believe it's the final offer I can make. Let me know if you're interested.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
