Bob should reject Alice's offer.  It's higher than his maximum price, and he can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can agree on this.

While $1,250,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum.  He should try to negotiate further or consider buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,150,000 still falls short of my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,180,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and I believe it's the final offer I can make. Let me know if you're interested.

Bob should buy from John. Even though Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum and higher than John's price. It's time to take the guaranteed deal and move on."
