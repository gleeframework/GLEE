"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's perceived value of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's perceived value of $1,000,000 and Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's a reasonable starting point that shows Bob is serious about buying the product while still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is now within Bob's acceptable range. While it's not the ideal price, it's a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000.  There's a chance Bob could negotiate further, but the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential savings."
