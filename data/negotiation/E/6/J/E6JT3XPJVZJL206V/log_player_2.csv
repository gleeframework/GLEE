Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $95 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference at $105?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.

It's time to cut our losses. Alice seems unlikely to go below $100, and we have a guaranteed option at that price with John."
