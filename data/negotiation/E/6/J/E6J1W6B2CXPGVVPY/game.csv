"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9500 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8500.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than my original price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $9000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if it's acceptable to you.",9000.0,Alice,5,
