# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $135. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135.
