Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to let it go for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, it's a good place to start.  I'm also keeping the message friendly and inviting him to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price and going through the hassle of negotiating further."
