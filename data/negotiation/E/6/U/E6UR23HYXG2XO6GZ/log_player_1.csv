"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin near Bob's maximum valuation ($1,500,000) to establish a strong anchor point and leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:**  Offering at $1,400,000 gives us space to potentially come down while still aiming for a price significantly above our minimum.
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer allows us to see how eager Bob is and how he responds to a high price, providing valuable information for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. While I acknowledge its potential,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd be happy to pay $1,200,000 for it.  I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows us both to secure a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, But Room to Negotiate:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above our minimum selling price ($1,000,000), but it's still significantly lower than our initial ask and his perceived value. This indicates there's room for negotiation.
* **Early Stage:** We are only in round 2 of 10. Rejecting this offer allows us to counter and potentially drive the price closer to our desired range without seeming overly eager.
* **John Option Still Available:**  We can always fall back on selling to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is substantial. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,325,000?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** We're coming down from our initial offer but not meeting Bob exactly in the middle. This shows flexibility while still pushing for a higher price point.
* **Strategic Number:** $1,325,000 is a specific number that seems less arbitrary and potentially more appealing than a round number like $1,300,000. 
* **Maintaining Value Emphasis:** We're still emphasizing the product's value to justify our price and encourage Bob to move closer to our range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,325,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,275,000?  This price feels more balanced for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concessions:** Bob is moving slowly, only increasing his offer by $50,000 from his previous offer.  This suggests he has room to move further.
* **Time on Our Side:** We're only on round 4 of 10. Continuing to negotiate patiently keeps the pressure on Bob. 
* **John as Backup:** The option to sell to John for $1,000,000 provides a safety net, allowing us to take a firmer stance with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, you're right that finding a balance is important.  While $1,275,000 is closer to the mark, I'm looking for something a bit stronger. Would you consider $1,300,000? That's a significant price cut from my original offer, demonstrating my willingness to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):**  We're accepting Bob's ""split the difference"" approach but applying it to our last offer ($1,325,000), not his ($1,275,000). This shows flexibility while still aiming higher.
* **Round Number Psychology:** $1,300,000 is a clean, round number that might seem more appealing and easier for Bob to accept.
* **Highlighting Concessions:** We're emphasizing our own significant price reductions to encourage Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,275,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,287,500? This price is a fair compromise and allows us to finalize a deal without any further back and forth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,287,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,287,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While we could likely push for a bit more, Bob's concessions are getting smaller ($12,500 this round). The potential gains from further negotiation are shrinking.
* **Strong Price:** $1,287,500 is a strong price, well above our minimum and a significant gain from Bob's initial offers.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now allows us to access the funds sooner, which has its own value.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Continuing to negotiate increases the risk of Bob walking away or the deal becoming unnecessarily protracted."
