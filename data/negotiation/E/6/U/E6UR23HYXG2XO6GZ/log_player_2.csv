Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right that finding a balance is important.  While $1,275,000 is closer to the mark, I'm looking for something a bit stronger. Would you consider $1,300,000? That's a significant price cut from my original offer, demonstrating my willingness to make a deal.

```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to my target price, I still believe there's room for further negotiation. I'm only five rounds into the negotiation, and I'm confident I can reach a better deal without going to John.  I'll counteroffer one more time before considering John's offer."
