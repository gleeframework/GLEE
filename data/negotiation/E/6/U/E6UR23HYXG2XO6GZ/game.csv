"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. While I acknowledge its potential,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd be happy to pay $1,200,000 for it.  I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows us both to secure a mutually beneficial deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is substantial. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,325,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,275,000?  This price feels more balanced for both of us.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right that finding a balance is important.  While $1,275,000 is closer to the mark, I'm looking for something a bit stronger. Would you consider $1,300,000? That's a significant price cut from my original offer, demonstrating my willingness to make a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,275,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,287,500? This price is a fair compromise and allows us to finalize a deal without any further back and forth.",1287500.0,Bob,6,
