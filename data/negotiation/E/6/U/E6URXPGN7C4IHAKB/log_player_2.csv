```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, and we're now within a reasonable range.  While I would prefer to get it for my initial offer of $1,000,000, $1,075,000 is a good deal considering the product's value to me and the fact that John is selling it for $1,500,000.  I'm going to accept this offer and close the deal."
