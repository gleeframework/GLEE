Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A positive and encouraging message might make Bob more willing to negotiate.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me a safety net. If Bob rejects my offer, I can either counter or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price. I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **John is a Safety Net:** If Bob refuses my counteroffer, I can confidently sell to John for a much higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your interest.  While $9,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I'm starting at a price slightly lower than my original offer, showing flexibility. 
* **Finding Middle Ground:** $11,000 is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, aiming to get closer to his budget without significantly compromising my profit.
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  I'm staying engaged and hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,500? I'm really interested in the product and think it's worth the price, but I need to make it work within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Close to Minimum:** $10,500 is very close to my absolute minimum of $15,000.  I'm not willing to go any lower. 
* **Time is Money:**  The negotiations are taking time, and John is a guaranteed sale.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Selling to John ensures I get the best possible price and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
