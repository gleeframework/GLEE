"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is within his budget, it's still higher than what he'd pay John. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. He knows the product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, but he's starting with a price that's $200,000 lower than his own budget. This aggressive counteroffer is meant to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially create a starting point for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay John. Even though the offer is closer to Bob's budget, he still has time to try and negotiate a better price with Alice.  Continuing to reject offers and make counteroffers will potentially pressure Alice into lowering the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price than John's offer, but he's slightly increasing his counteroffer to show he's willing to compromise. This counteroffer demonstrates that Bob is serious about buying the product from Alice, but is still pushing for a price closer to his desired goal. By increasing his offer, Bob shows good faith while still keeping the negotiation moving towards his desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay John. While there are still rounds left to negotiate, the price seems to be stagnating.  Buying from John guarantees Bob the product for his maximum price, eliminating the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
