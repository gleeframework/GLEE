"Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a price of $120.  I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is tempting, I can't go quite that low.  Would you be willing to do $105? It's a compromise, but I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $90, so I'm thinking $92.50. Would you be willing to accept that?",92.5,Bob,4,
