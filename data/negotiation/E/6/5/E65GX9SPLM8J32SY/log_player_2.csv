Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to negotiate a better price. Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is tempting, I can't go quite that low.  Would you be willing to do $105? It's a compromise, but I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.
