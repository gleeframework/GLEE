Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already offered you a great deal, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,200. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium service package worth $800, so the total value you'll get is $8,000 + $800 = $8,800. That's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000.
