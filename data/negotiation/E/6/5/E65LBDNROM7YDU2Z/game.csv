"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to sell the product for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $8,200. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I have a firm budget and $8,000 is the most I can offer.  I understand if that doesn't work for you, but it's a fair price.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already offered you a great deal, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,200. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium service package worth $800, so the total value you'll get is $8,000 + $800 = $8,800. That's the best I can do.",8000.0,Alice,7,
