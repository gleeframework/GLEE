"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be equally valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,650,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and the potential benefits it could bring to your business.  Let me know your thoughts.",1650000.0,Alice,1,
