"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is significantly above Bob's value. 
* **Negotiation is possible.**  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is an option.**  Bob has a backup option of buying from John for $8,000, giving him leverage in negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some profit for you.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which still gives you a good deal. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's come down from $12,000, $10,000 is still above Bob's maximum value of $8,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible.**  The price has decreased, indicating Alice is open to negotiation.  There's likely room for further compromise.
* **Buying from John is still an option.**  Bob's fallback option with John at $8,000 gives him leverage to continue negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is closer to my value and still gives you a decent profit.  Let's find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. This gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum. Let's finalize this and move forward. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's come down to $9,500, Bob is still paying more than his maximum value of $8,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible.**  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and there's a small gap between their offers.  
* **Buying from John is still an option.**  Bob's fallback option of $8,000 provides leverage to continue negotiation.

**Counter-offering strategy:** Bob should aim for a final price closer to $9,000. A small increase in his counter-offer might be enough to push Alice closer to his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $9,250. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to come closer to our target prices. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price, but $9,250 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,400, which is a fair compromise and allows us to close this deal. It's a win-win situation for both of us!  Let's finalize this and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget.** While $9,400 is higher than Bob's ideal price, it's still within his maximum value of $8,000.
* **Negotiation has stalled.** Both parties are close to their desired price, and further negotiation might not lead to a significantly better outcome.
* **Buying from John is still an option.** However, given the price difference between Alice's offer and John's, the potential savings are minimal.

**Conclusion:**  It's strategically advantageous for Bob to accept Alice's offer. While not ideal, it secures the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation or potentially paying a higher price from John."
