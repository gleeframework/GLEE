"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Counter-Offers:**  This price allows for potential negotiation without immediately reaching the point where I'd rather sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some profit for you.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $15,000.  I'm not desperate for a sale and have a guaranteed buyer in John.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. There's still room to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which still gives you a good deal. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and proposing a counter-offer. 
* **Moving Closer:** I've moved down from my initial price but still remain above Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Language:** I'm emphasizing the benefits for Bob (""good deal"", ""win-win"") to encourage a positive response. 
* **Urgency:** ""Let's make this happen!"" suggests that I'm eager to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is closer to my value and still gives you a decent profit.  Let's find a middle ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has come up a bit, $9,000 is still far from my minimum of $15,000. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating. There's still room for both of us to reach a more favorable price. I'm not desperate to sell and have a backup buyer in John who will pay my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. This gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum. Let's finalize this and move forward. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer and proposing a counter-offer.
* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by meeting him halfway between our previous offers.
* **Urgency:**  ""Let's finalize this and move forward"" suggests that I'm getting closer to my limit and would like to reach an agreement. 
* **Focus on Benefits:**  I'm emphasizing the benefits for Bob (""good deal"") to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $9,250. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to come closer to our target prices. Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $9,250 is still significantly less than my minimum of $15,000. I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my desired price, so I can afford to be patient and continue negotiating with Bob.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

```
