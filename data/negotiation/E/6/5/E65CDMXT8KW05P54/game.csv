"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me. However, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $11,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've got to make sure I'm getting a fair price for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a fair profit, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can agree on this.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're serious about buying the product. However, I've got to think about my own needs and goals. I'm willing to meet you at $10,250, which is a compromise between our previous offers. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,250 is still beyond my budget.  I'm confident we can find a win-win solution.  Let's close this deal at $10,000, which would be a fair price for both of us.  It would be a shame to miss this opportunity due to a small difference.",10000.0,Bob,8,
