"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a bold counteroffer at $1,000,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and also lower than Bob's maximum budget. This move is designed to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and establish a starting point for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it is still above what he is willing to pay.  He should continue negotiating to try and secure a better price. There's still room for improvement, and he might be able to get closer to his target of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now raising his offer to $1,250,000. This is a significant increase from his previous offer, showing his willingness to compromise. It also keeps him within his budget but leaves room for some additional negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is closer to Bob's target price, he can likely still negotiate a better deal. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to push for a lower price and potentially secure the product closer to his ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer to $1,300,000. This is a moderate increase from his previous offer, showing his willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to his target of $1,200,000. This offer is within his budget, but it leaves room for one more counteroffer from Alice if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is now very close to Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. Given that they are in the 7th round out of 10, there's a high chance that further negotiation won't lead to a significantly better price. It's more likely that Alice might increase her counteroffer, potentially pushing the price above Bob's budget. Accepting the offer at this point ensures Bob secures the product while staying within his financial limits."
