"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but not too far off.  This gives me some room to negotiate, but hopefully, it won't scare him off right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and counter with a higher price.  I'm still aiming to get as close to my desired price of $120 as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115.  How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
I'm offering $115, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I think this is a fair price, considering the value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we both want to get a fair deal here, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $107 is closer to my target price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to drop my price to $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm coming down to $110, which is a significant concession, but still leaves me with a profit margin. Hopefully, this will be enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting close. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $108.  Do you think that would work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting frustrating! Bob is not budging much, and we're running out of rounds. I'm not going to waste any more time. I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  At least I'll get my minimum price and avoid further negotiation."
