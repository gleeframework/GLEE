"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,050,000? This price still allows you a substantial profit margin while ensuring I receive a fair value for the product. Let's find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $1,050,000. How about $980,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",980000.0,Bob,4,
