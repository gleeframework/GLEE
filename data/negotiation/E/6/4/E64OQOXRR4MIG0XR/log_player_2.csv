"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price, as the product is worth significantly more to you than to me. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up at $1,000,000, so I'm confident I'll be able to sell it either way. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Here's how to break down the decision:

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,100,000
* **Your Maximum:** $1,200,000
* **John's Offer:** $1,200,000

You can save $100,000 by accepting Alice's offer. While she claims to have another buyer, you have no way to verify that, and it's irrelevant to your goal of getting the best price.

**Answer:** {""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
