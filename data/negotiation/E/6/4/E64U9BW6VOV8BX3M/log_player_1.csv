Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will bite at a price just below that.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting high gives you room to negotiate down if Bob counters. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""special price"" phrasing might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

While there's a chance Bob will reject this offer, it's the best strategy to potentially earn the most profit. If he rejects, you still have your guaranteed sale to John."
