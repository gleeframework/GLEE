Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Staying Above John's Offer:**  Alice knows John will buy the product for $150, so she wants to secure a price higher than that.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** While $120 is significantly higher than Bob's valuation, it's presented as a take-it-or-leave-it offer, making it seem like a good deal. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a chance to buy the product. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale with John at a price that meets her minimum."
