``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a win-win scenario.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to his perceived value of the product, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable price.  

**Next Round:**

I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired price point, but still leaving room for further negotiation."

* **Leave Room for Further Negotiation:** I'm still open to negotiation, indicating that I'm flexible and willing to work with Bob.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is a slight improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting his offer would mean selling the product at a loss. 

I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to achieve a price closer to my desired price point.  I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,200,000, which gives me leverage in the negotiation.

I will counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving some room for further negotiation."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Small Concession:** I'm offering a small concession from my previous counteroffer, but still maintaining a price above my minimum acceptable price.

* **Maintain Openness to Negotiation:** I'm ending the message with a positive tone, indicating that I'm still open to discussing the price further.

I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to achieve a price closer to my desired price point. I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,200,000, which gives me leverage in the negotiation.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $990,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,005,000 as a final offer. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. If you're serious about this deal, I'm ready to close it now. Otherwise, I have another buyer waiting."", ""product_price"": 1005000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm presenting this as my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Significant Compromise:** I'm emphasizing the concession I'm making to demonstrate my willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Time-Sensitive Offer:** I'm hinting at a time constraint by mentioning another buyer, raising the stakes for Bob.

This strategy aims to push Bob towards accepting my offer while still leaving a small margin for negotiation if necessary. If Bob still refuses, I'm prepared to move forward with John and secure the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $995000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $995,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  We've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly better price.  

Given that I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,200,000, it's in my best interest to end the negotiation with Bob and sell the product to John.  This will ensure that I maximize my profit and achieve my goal of selling the product for no less than $1,200,000."
