"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. I believe it would greatly benefit you. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While I have a fallback buyer, aiming high initially maximizes potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A starting price of $1,400,000 allows room for negotiation while still securing a significant portion of the product's value to Bob.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message conveys the product's value without revealing my own minimum, encouraging Bob to engage seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than our target. While it's higher than John's offer, we have room to negotiate and aim closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000. We're only in Round 2, so there's time to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,100,000 undervalues its potential benefits. To find a middle ground, how about we consider $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Interest:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone is important for a smooth negotiation.
* **Justifying the Price:** Briefly reiterating the product's value strengthens the position without being overly aggressive.
* **Significant Step Down, But Holding Firm:**  Moving down $100,000 shows flexibility while still targeting a price significantly above both Bob's offer and John's alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,200,000 is a $200,000 profit over our minimum and a significant gain over John's offer. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise and move closer to our price point.
* **Time Value:**  While we have rounds remaining, securing a good deal now avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further lowballing."
