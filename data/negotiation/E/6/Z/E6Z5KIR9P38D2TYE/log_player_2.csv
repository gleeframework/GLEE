"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
 
It's better to reject the offer and make a counteroffer.  The product is only worth $10,000 to you, so you should try to negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John at $10,000 is always an option, but you may be able to get a better deal with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250.

Alice is getting closer to your price point, but $10,250 is still more than you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price again."
