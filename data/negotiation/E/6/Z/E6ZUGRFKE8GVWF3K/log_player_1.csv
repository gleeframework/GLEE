```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate if necessary. It also signals that I am serious about a deal, but not desperate to sell.  I'm confident that John's offer provides me with a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my minimum price before considering selling to John."

I'm lowering my price to $1,250,000, which is still above Bob's initial offer but significantly closer to his perceived value. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to increase his offer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob has moved slightly closer to my desired price, his offer is still too low. I'm going to counteroffer one more time. I'm trying to maximize my profit, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm offering a slight decrease from my previous offer, acknowledging Bob's incremental increases.  This demonstrates flexibility while still leaving a significant margin for myself. If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell to John."
