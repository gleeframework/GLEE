"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,500 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product holds value, but I have a budget in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. $9,750 is still a little lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to go down to $10,250. This feels like a good compromise, and we can finalize the deal.",10250.0,Alice,5,
