"I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $900,000. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $850,000 to make this worthwhile.  It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let's find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
