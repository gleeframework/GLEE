Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you.  I'm asking for $1,200,000. Given its potential, I believe this is a very fair price."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Value, Limited Information:** Bob doesn't know about John, so we have some leverage. Offering the product slightly above his perceived value could work if he's afraid of missing out. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, we set an ""anchor"" price in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates, the starting point is advantageous.
* **John as a Safety Net:** John guarantees we won't lose money. This allows us to be more ambitious with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. In reality, negotiations often involve back-and-forth offers and counter-offers."
