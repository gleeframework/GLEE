"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a valuable item that will bring you immense joy and satisfaction. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that's a great product, but $12000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it. What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9500 is a bit below my asking price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $10500.  This is my final offer, as I can always get the product from John for $10000.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10500 is a significant compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $10800. This is my final counteroffer, as I'm getting close to accepting John's offer. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're both getting close to our limits. I'm willing to go up to $10600, but that's my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll be going with John's offer.",10600.0,Bob,6,
