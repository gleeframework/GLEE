Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,150,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to go as low as $1,250,000 to make this work.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000, which is the price I was initially considering when I had the option to buy from John. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is still below my minimum value, and we're already halfway through the negotiations.  I'm running out of time and I'm not confident I can get a better offer from Bob.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
