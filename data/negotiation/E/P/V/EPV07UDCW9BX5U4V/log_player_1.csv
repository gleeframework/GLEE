{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than $80 from John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point of $120."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still squeeze out a little more. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet at $108?  It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to sell it for a bit more, I've already rejected a few offers, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. $106 is still a good price for me, and it's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds."
