Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from the sale.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($10,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially settling on a price higher than $10,000 but lower than his maximum valuation.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you still secure a profitable sale.

By starting the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value, you increase the chances of securing a higher final sale price."
