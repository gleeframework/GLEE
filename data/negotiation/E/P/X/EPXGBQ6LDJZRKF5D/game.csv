"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for around $70.  What do you think?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that my initial offer might have been a bit high. How about we meet in the middle somewhere? Would you consider $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit, but $130 is still more than I had in mind. Could you maybe do $90? That would be a great deal for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $90 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. This is my final offer.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me too. That's closer to what I had in mind.  How about we split the difference and do $100? It's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy.",100.0,Bob,6,
