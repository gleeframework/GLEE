"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you're interested in. I'm offering it to you for $130.  Let me know if you're interested!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to buy it for $90.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $110?  This would give us both a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $110 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $100, which is closer to my budget. If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're on a budget, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close the deal at this price.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  This would be a good compromise for both of us.",100.0,Bob,6,
