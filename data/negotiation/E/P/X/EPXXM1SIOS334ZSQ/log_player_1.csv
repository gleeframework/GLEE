Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you're interested in. I'm offering it to you for $130.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to buy it for $90.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $90 is too low, and I think I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $110?  This would give us both a fair deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $110 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $100, which is closer to my budget. If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to try to push for a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're on a budget, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  This would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  Bob seems unwilling to budge from his price, and I've already gone lower than I'd like.  John is offering a much better deal, so I'm going to take it."
