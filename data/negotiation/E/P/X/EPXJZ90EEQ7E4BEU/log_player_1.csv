"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly below what the product is worth to Bob. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving you with a profit significantly above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I believe I can offer $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is more than your minimum, it's still significantly below the value to Bob.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping for a bit more. How about $130? It's still a great deal for you, and we can close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to offer $125 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still below the initial price you hoped for, it's only $5 away from your last counter-offer.  Accepting this offer ensures a profit, and with only 6 rounds left, it's not worth risking a further stalemate."
