"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree this product would be beneficial, the price point is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise from my initial offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,100,000 is still a little steep for my budget. Could we agree on $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise from my initial offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can do $950,000 to get this deal done today. What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm thinking of a price of $1,075,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise from my previous offers.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is my final offer. I can offer $1,000,000.  This is as high as I can go. Let me know.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm not willing to accept it. I believe the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to wait for a better offer. I'm going to make one last counteroffer: $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to give you one last chance to make it work.",1100000.0,Alice,9,
