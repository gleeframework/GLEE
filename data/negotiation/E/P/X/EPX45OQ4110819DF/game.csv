"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $125. Let me know if that's more to your liking!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow us to close this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'll meet you at $110, which is my absolute minimum. If that's still not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",110.0,Alice,5,
