Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'll meet you at $110, which is my absolute minimum. If that's still not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.

Alice is still holding out for a price that's above my maximum. At this point, it's better to just buy the product from John for $80. It saves me time and stress, and I still get the product I want at a good price."
