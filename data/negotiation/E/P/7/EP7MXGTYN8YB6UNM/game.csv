"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'd be happy to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $13,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $15,500. It's getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm willing to make one more move to try to reach an agreement. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
