{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  It's valued at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is serious about buying, and gauge his initial response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is my minimum price, but I'm not desperate.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is a good compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12500 is still slightly above what I'm comfortable paying. How about $11500 as a final offer? It's a good compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is a good compromise and very close to my minimum. It's better than selling to John for $10,000, and there's a good chance I won't get a better offer from Bob. I'm going to accept."
