Round 2

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price still leaves us both with a good profit margin. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Bob's offer:

With only two rounds left, I don't have the time to further negotiate with Bob.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe bet.  It guarantees me a good profit and avoids the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob."
