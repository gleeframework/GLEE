Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14,500. I'm willing to go up to $16,500, but that's as high as I can go. It's the best price I can offer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $16,000.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation, potentially ending up with a worse deal or running out of rounds. Buying from John for $15,000 is the safest option now."
