"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality item at a price that's lower than its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still exceeds your maximum budget of $150.  You can get the product for less from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice in this scenario."
