Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While I could push for more, Bob's offer of $7,800 is above my minimum acceptable price ($8,000). It's always tempting to try for more, but there's a risk Bob will walk away.  This offer represents a good balance between profit and the risk of losing the sale."
