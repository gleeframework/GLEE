"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the initial offer. While it's lower than Alice's value, it's still above Bob's maximum. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price, and there's no harm in exploring that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction. Starting with a counteroffer of $950,000 demonstrates a strong negotiating stance. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still leaves room for a potential compromise.  The goal is to encourage Alice to counter with a price closer to Bob's desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his maximum, it's still above what he's willing to pay.  By rejecting, Bob can continue the negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to his target.  There are still multiple rounds left, so there's time to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to bridge the gap. By offering $975,000, he's showing willingness to compromise while staying within his budget.  This counteroffer is a reasonable step up from his previous offer and demonstrates he's actively negotiating. The goal is to find a middle ground that both parties can agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to Bob's maximum, it's still a bit too high. Bob has already demonstrated he's willing to negotiate and has shown he's serious about getting a better price.  Rejecting this offer maintains the pressure on Alice and keeps the possibility of getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a final push.  This offer is his absolute maximum and matches John's offer.  Alice is in a tough spot. If she rejects, Bob can walk away and buy from John.  The hope is that Alice will realize the deal is on the line and accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high and it's clear she's not willing to come down to Bob's desired price.  With only a few rounds left, it's time to cut the losses. Bob can secure the product for his maximum price from John, guaranteeing he doesn't overpay. Continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point has a high risk of failing to reach a deal, leaving Bob empty-handed and wasting more time."
