I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000.  This is the minimum amount I'm willing to accept, as the product is worth at least that much to me. It's possible Bob will reject this offer, but I'm willing to see if he's willing to pay my price. If not, I can always sell to John for the same amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price. I'm confident I can make a counteroffer that Bob will find appealing while still getting a good price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a compromise from my original price, but still a good deal for me as it's above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my full price. It's time to cut my losses and move on."
