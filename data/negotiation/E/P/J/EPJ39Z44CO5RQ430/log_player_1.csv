{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable item, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's estimated value, but it gives him some room to negotiate. It's also significantly less than my minimum acceptable price, so I have room to lower the price if necessary.
* **The message:** I'm being polite and direct, clearly stating the price and the value of the product. I'm also leaving the door open for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This is a strategic opening offer that:

* **Maximizes potential profit:**  It's a strong starting point, giving me the best chance to earn a high price.
* **Encourages negotiation:** It allows for a back-and-forth, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Provides an alternative:**  The option of selling to John for $1,000,000 gives me leverage if Bob rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $750,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell the product for less than it's worth to me.  

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  This demonstrates that I'm serious about my value for the product and won't settle for a low price.
* **Continuing negotiations:**  By rejecting and sending a counteroffer, I keep the negotiation open, giving me the opportunity to potentially reach a price that is more favorable to me.
* **Leverage with John:** The option to sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me leverage throughout the negotiation process."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $750,000 is lower than I hoped, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price is still fair, considering the product's value.  Let me know if you'd be willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$850,000:** This counteroffer represents a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. It's still above his estimated value, but it shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **The message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and reiterating the product's value while suggesting a compromise. I'm using persuasive language (""fair price,"" ""meet me halfway"") to encourage him to accept.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain leverage:** The counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still staying within my minimum acceptable price range.
* **Signal willingness to negotiate:**  This demonstrates that I'm flexible and open to finding a mutually agreeable price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $775,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I am not willing to sell the product at a loss, and I believe there is still room for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** This demonstrates that I am serious about getting a fair price for my product. I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm willing to walk away if I don't get what I feel is a fair deal.

* **Maintaining leverage:** The option to sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me a strong fallback position, making me less likely to cave to Bob's pressure."
