"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I know it's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. To start, I'd like to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? I believe this price is fair considering the value you'll gain from the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  Let's try $950,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm still not quite there at $950,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,000,000?  That would be a win-win for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  I'm offering $975,000.  This represents a real compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me.  I hope we can finalize this deal in the next few rounds.",975000.0,Bob,6,
