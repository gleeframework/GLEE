Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I believe it's a great deal and you'll be very happy with it."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit. 
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A $30 markup (25% increase) is a reasonable starting point. It allows room for negotiation while still securing a significant gain if Bob accepts.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the product's value and frames the offer positively, increasing the chances of Bob accepting."
