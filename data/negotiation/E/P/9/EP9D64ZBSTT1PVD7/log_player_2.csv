"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($1,200,000), it's still a significant amount. Bob can potentially save more money by negotiating further. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and explore if he can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value you'll get from the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's ideal price. While it's a slight improvement from her previous offer, Bob can likely still secure a better deal with further negotiation.  He's still better off rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer to see if he can push the price down further."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what Bob is comfortable with. Bob should continue negotiating and try to push the price down further. It's likely that Alice, having already made a concession, might be willing to budge a bit more."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The price is getting closer:** Alice has made several concessions, and this offer is closer to Bob's desired price range.
* **Risk of going to John:** If Bob rejects this offer and makes another counteroffer, there's a risk Alice will refuse and Bob will be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.
* **Limited negotiating room:** It's likely Alice is reaching her limit. Further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price.

While Bob might prefer to pay closer to $890,000, accepting this offer secures the product at a price that's still within his budget and significantly less than what he'd pay John."
