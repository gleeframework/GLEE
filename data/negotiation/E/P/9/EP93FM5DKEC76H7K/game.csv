"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product that I think you'll really love. I'm looking for $20000 for it. Would you like to make an offer or accept my price?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $15000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $18000. Would you be willing to go up to that price?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still not able to go that high.  How about we split the difference and I pay $16500? This would be a good deal for both of us.",16500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go as low as $16500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $18000 and $16500. How about we try $17250? It's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",17250.0,Alice,5,
