"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me.  I'm starting at $12,000, but I'm open to reasonable offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $12000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you consider $9000?  I'm serious about buying, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,000 is still too low for me, and I'm confident I can get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $9000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're still looking for a higher price, but $10500 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $10000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to accept this, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I might need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is closer to what I want, it's still a bit below my target.  I'm going to counteroffer again, and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $10,250?  It's closer to your offer, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10250 is still a bit more than I can manage.  If you're willing to meet me at $10000, we can close the deal.  This is my final offer, as I have another option available for the same product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This time I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd still prefer a little more, I'm concerned that if I reject him, he'll really go with his other option.  $10,000 is a good deal, and it's better than selling to John for $8,000."
