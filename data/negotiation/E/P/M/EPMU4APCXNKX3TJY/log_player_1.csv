"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'll see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and how much I want to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is way too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price.  This shows flexibility while also indicating that I'm not willing to settle for Bob's very low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell and I'd prefer to try for a better price.  I'll counter again and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price but still want to see if Bob will budge a little more. If he rejects, I might have to consider selling to John, but I'll keep trying to get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$12,000 is getting closer to what I want, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to try for a better deal, and if I don't get it, I'll sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still trying to squeeze out a little more. I'm also aware that I'm running out of rounds, and I'm not sure if I can get a better offer than this. If he rejects, I might just have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is getting close to my minimum price, but I'm running out of rounds.  The risk of getting a lower offer or not being able to close the deal is too high.  I'm going to sell to John and secure the guaranteed $15,000."
