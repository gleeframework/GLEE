"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $15,000 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is much higher than both your budget and John's offer. You should definitely reject and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""That price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $6,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong opening move in the negotiation. It signals that you're serious about buying but expect a much better deal.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This initial offer gives you ample room to negotiate upwards towards your $8,000 limit if needed.
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** Alice's reaction to this low offer will give you valuable insight into how flexible she might be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $6,000, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice is moving closer to your range, $9,000 is still above your $8,000 budget and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to meet ""halfway"" suggests there's flexibility in her pricing. 
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** You can use John's $8,000 offer as leverage to push Alice closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I could do $7,000, which I think is a fair offer considering the current market."", 
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** This offer is strategically placed between Alice's current price ($9,000) and your ideal price (closer to John's $8,000). 
* **Justification:** Mentioning the ""current market"" subtly reminds Alice of your alternative option (John) without directly revealing your absolute limit.
* **Maintaining Politeness:**  Continuing to use appreciative language keeps the negotiation amicable and encourages Alice to compromise further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,500, as that's the minimum I can accept to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice has drawn a line in the sand at $8,500. This is above your budget and you've already used John's offer as leverage.
* **Minimal Savings:** Even if you could negotiate Alice down slightly, the potential savings are minimal compared to John's guaranteed price.
* **Time Cost:** Further negotiation rounds could be time-consuming with no guarantee of success. It's more efficient to go with John's offer."
