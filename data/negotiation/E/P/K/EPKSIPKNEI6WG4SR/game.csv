"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its capabilities. I could consider a price of $1,400,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the true value of what's being offered.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. However, $1,400,000 is still  too far out of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000 to find a solution that works for both of us. Let me know if you're open to this.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is firmly above $1,000,000. To meet you halfway, I can offer it for $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another interested buyer at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
