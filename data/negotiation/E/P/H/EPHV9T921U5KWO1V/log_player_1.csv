Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking $175 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$175 price:** This is a starting point that's higher than Bob's value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly message:** Building a good rapport can be helpful in negotiations. 
* **Focus on value:**  The message hints at the product's potential value to Bob without revealing my minimum acceptable price. 

This approach allows me to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If Bob rejects immediately, it might be a sign that my price is too high.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** This gives me flexibility to adjust my price if necessary while still maximizing my profit.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:**  If the negotiation drags on or becomes unproductive, I can always opt for the guaranteed $150 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Accepting this offer would result in a loss for me.
* **Proceeding to the next round:**  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price range.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal. 
* **Keeping John as a backup:** Even though I'm rejecting Bob's offer, I haven't committed to selling to him. I can still choose to sell to John for $150 if the negotiation with Bob becomes too time-consuming or unproductive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a great deal for you considering the value this product offers. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer at $140:** This is a compromise, still above my minimum price of $150 but closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Positive message:**  I'm trying to keep the conversation amicable and focus on the value proposition for Bob.
* **Emphasize the deal:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob to encourage him to accept.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects again, I can still make another counteroffer or choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below the $150 I can get from John.  Considering the risk of further negotiation with Bob, I'm choosing to:

* **Sell to John:**  This guarantees me the highest price and avoids the uncertainty of continuing negotiations. 
* **Minimize potential losses:**  Staying at $130 with Bob carries the risk of further concessions or even a complete breakdown in negotiations. 

By selling to John, I'm securing a guaranteed profit and saving myself the time and effort of potentially lengthy negotiations."
