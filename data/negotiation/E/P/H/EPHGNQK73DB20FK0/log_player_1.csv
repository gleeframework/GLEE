Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's incredibly valuable, but I'm willing to part with it for $140. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a larger profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects a price significantly higher than his perceived value, it might not be worth further negotiation."
