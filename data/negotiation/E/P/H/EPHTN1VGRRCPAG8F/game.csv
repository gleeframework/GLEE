"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both recognize. Let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is a bit too low for me to consider at this time. How about we meet in the middle - would you be willing to go up to $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $2,000,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $1,750,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and hopefully a good middle ground. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
