{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you're likely to see."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping the price significantly above your minimum ($800,000).
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the product's value specific to Bob's needs makes the price more palatable.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be particularly strong-willed in negotiations, you might start slightly lower to avoid turning him off completely. 
* **Market Urgency:** If you're confident there are other potential buyers like Bob, you could be more firm on price."
