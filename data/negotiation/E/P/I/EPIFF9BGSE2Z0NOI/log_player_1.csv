"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'll assess Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still aiming for a higher profit. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to encourage Bob to meet me halfway. I'm still aiming for a significant profit, but I need to balance that with the risk of Bob rejecting my offer and potentially walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is consistent with his previous offer, and it's a good price. I'm happy to accept and secure the sale. I'm not sure if I can get a higher price with John, and there's a risk of losing him completely. It's better to take a good deal now."
