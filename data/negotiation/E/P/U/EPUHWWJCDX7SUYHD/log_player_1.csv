{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $95. I believe it's a great deal, given its value. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $95 is a bit high for me. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant at $90.  Would you be willing to go down to $88? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 
```
```
At this point, Bob is getting very close to your walk-away price. Accepting $88 ensures a profit and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer further or you having to settle for John's $80."
