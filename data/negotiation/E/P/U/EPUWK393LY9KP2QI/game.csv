"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price of $1,150,000. I would like to propose an offer of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate the adjustment. However, based on my current financial situation, I am still unable to reach $1,100,000. I would like to propose an offer of $1,075,000. This is the highest I can go without exceeding my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
