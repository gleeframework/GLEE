Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It shows I'm serious about selling to Bob but also willing to compromise. 
* **Message:** The message is polite and highlights the value of the product to Bob, which might encourage him to accept.

**Strategy:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price that is still within Bob's range of what he's willing to pay, but closer to my desired price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's enough space for Bob to counteroffer, but it's clear that I'm not desperate to sell. This will hopefully prevent him from making too low of an offer.
* **Plan B:** Having John as a backup option provides me with a safety net. I can always stop the negotiation with Bob and sell to John if I'm not satisfied with his offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than my minimum acceptable value. It's not worth settling for that price. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting the product at a significant discount from its true value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm counter-offering at $1,250,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still maintaining a price that's closer to my desired value.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will be getting at this price, and I'm remaining positive and open to a deal.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** My counteroffer is a good compromise and shows I'm flexible.
* **Maintaining Value:** Even at $1,250,000, I'll still be selling the product above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Keep Negotiating:** By rejecting Bob's initial offer and making a counteroffer, I'm showing I'm willing to negotiate. This will hopefully prevent him from becoming discouraged and walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, and I appreciate you coming down. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $1,175,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $1,250,000. It's a good compromise, and I'm comfortable with this price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk that Bob will walk away.  Accepting his offer guarantees a sale at a price that's still higher than my minimum acceptable value and close to my desired price.
* **Time Factor:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time, and I may not be able to get a better price.

**Strategy:**

* **Prioritize Closing the Deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to quickly close the deal and secure a good price.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  This option minimizes the risk of Bob walking away or the negotiation becoming too lengthy. 
* **Balancing Value and Efficiency:**  While I could try for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer is the most efficient and practical choice at this point."
