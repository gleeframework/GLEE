"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this stage. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this incredible product. How about we meet at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,100,000 is closer to where I'd like to be, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  Let's try $1,050,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while also reflecting my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer on that front.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
