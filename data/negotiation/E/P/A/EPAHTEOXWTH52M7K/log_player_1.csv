Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $145 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** I want to get as close to $150 as possible, but I also want to increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $145 is a strong starting point, offering slightly below my absolute minimum ($150) might encourage Bob to negotiate, potentially landing somewhere above $150. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150 gives me leverage. I don't need to go below that price."
