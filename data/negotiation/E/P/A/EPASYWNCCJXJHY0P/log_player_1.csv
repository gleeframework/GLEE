"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept. This allows room for negotiation while still aiming for the best possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum price of $8,000. While I could sell to John for that price, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think $8,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. Can you consider meeting me at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue to negotiate and try for a higher price, there's no guarantee I'll get it, and I'm at risk of running out of rounds. Accepting this offer guarantees me my minimum profit."
