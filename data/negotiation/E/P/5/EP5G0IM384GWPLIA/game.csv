"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8000? ",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9000?  It's still a great price for this incredible product!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $9000.  Would you be willing to consider $8500?  I'm ready to make a decision today if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there at $8500.  Let's split the difference and go with $8750.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal today!",8750.0,Alice,5,
