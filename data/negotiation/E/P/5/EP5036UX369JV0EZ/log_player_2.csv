Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid I can't accept $8,000. I'm willing to compromise, though! I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500. It's a great price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we try $10,200? It's still a great price for you, and I'm getting close to my minimum price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to come down significantly from her $10,200 offer. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation when you have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $10,000 from John."
