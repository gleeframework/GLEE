"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I know it's worth the same to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is trying to sell the product for more than it's worth to you. You can get it for $1,200,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more."
