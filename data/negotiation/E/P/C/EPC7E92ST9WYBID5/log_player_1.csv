{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm offering it to you for $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to start high and see if Bob is willing to pay more. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to re-evaluate and see if it's worth continuing negotiations with him or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find it at a lower price. Could you consider selling it for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $80 is too low for me. While it's better than nothing, it doesn't meet my minimum price of $100.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $90?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 90}
