"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $9,000 to make this worthwhile.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,750.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,875?  That's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.",8875.0,Alice,5,
