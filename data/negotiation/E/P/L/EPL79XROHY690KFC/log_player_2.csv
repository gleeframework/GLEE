"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get the price as close to his maximum budget as possible.  Offering $10,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer and might be tempting enough for her to consider, given the product is worth more to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  While further negotiation is possible, Bob can secure the product from John at his target price. There's no guarantee that Bob can get a better deal with Alice, so it's safer to go with the guaranteed option."
