Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still leaves a substantial profit margin for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
