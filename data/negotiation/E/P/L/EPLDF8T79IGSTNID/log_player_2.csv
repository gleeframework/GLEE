{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is now closer to your desired price, but it's still a bit higher than what you're willing to pay. Since you're only $50,000 away from your target, it's worth attempting one more counteroffer to see if you can secure a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is being stubborn and won't budge further. It's time to cut your losses and move on. You've successfully negotiated a lower price than Alice's initial offer, but it's still not ideal. John is offering a better price, and you're within your budget, so it's the most sensible decision."
