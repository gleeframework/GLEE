"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,350,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than her own valuation ($1,350,000 vs $800,000).  There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. Considering its value to me and a fair price for both of us, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:** This counteroffer represents a considerable drop from Alice's initial price, showing Bob is serious about getting a better deal.
