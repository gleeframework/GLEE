"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it can be a valuable asset. I'm willing to start the conversation at $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to make this deal work.  Let's find some common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $850,000?  It's a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
