"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some room to work with. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,275,000? It's a fair compromise, and I think we could both walk away happy.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your persistence, and I see we're getting closer. However, $1,275,000 is still a bit below what I need. To make this work for both of us, how about we settle at $1,300,000? This would be a good middle ground, and I'm confident it's a deal you'll be happy with.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand where you're coming from, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,280,000? It's a small concession from your latest offer, but I think it's worth it to get the deal done.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
