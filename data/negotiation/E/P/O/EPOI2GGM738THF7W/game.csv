"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest.  $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $9,000?  This is a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to my initial offer. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900.  This price is still fair and allows me to reach a good deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",8900.0,Alice,5,
