{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that's below Bob's perceived value, but still significantly higher than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potential counteroffers while still ensuring a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $10,000 is a bit steep.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a good offer, it's still below my ideal price.  I'm going to try and see if I can get closer to my desired amount.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
