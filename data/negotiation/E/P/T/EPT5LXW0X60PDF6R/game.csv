"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at $12,000. However, I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $11,000? It's a fair price considering its value to me and allows you to get a great product at a reasonable rate.",11000.0,Alice,3,
