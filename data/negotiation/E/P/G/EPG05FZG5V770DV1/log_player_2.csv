This is a significant discount compared to the market value of $12,000, aiming to make it more accessible while still ensuring a fair return for us. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations and if you're interested in proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,500 is below your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John.  There's room to negotiate with Alice and try to get a price closer to her own valuation of $8,000."
