"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do  $13,000. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $13,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $15,500?  This price reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $15,500 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $14,500?",14500.0,Bob,4,
