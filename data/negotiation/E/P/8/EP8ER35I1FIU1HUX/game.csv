"Hi Bob, I understand that $16500 was still a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $15500. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise and sell the product to you for $16000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and rarity.
