Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to encourage negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:** I'm leaving some room for negotiation, as I know Bob might not accept the first offer.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to make the offer appealing.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I'm aware that John is a backup buyer, providing me with a safety net if Bob refuses to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **John as a Backup:**  I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I won't lose out on a sale completely. 

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price for the value of this product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price, but not going down to Bob's initial offer. 
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the fair value of the product, justifying the price.
* **Collaborative Tone:**  I'm using language that suggests we're working together to find a solution.
* **Strategic Position:** This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while keeping my options open if Bob continues to push for a lower price."
