Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to start by offering Bob a price higher than what he's willing to pay, but lower than what I'm willing to accept from John. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, but also incentivizes him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try for a slightly higher price. I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is still below my minimum acceptable price but gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $90 is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm starting to get impatient.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $100 from John rather than risk another round of negotiation with Bob."
