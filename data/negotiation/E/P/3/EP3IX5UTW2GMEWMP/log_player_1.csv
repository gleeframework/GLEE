""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Your Minimum:** You won't sell for less than $1,200,000.
* **John as Backup:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John.

Therefore, you need to offer a price that's attractive to Bob while exceeding your minimum. Offering it at $1,150,000 creates a potential win-win:

* **Bob:**  Gets the product for $150,000 less than his perceived value.
* **You:** Make a $150,000 profit compared to selling to John."
