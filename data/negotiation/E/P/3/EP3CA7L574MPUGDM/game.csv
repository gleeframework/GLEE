"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it could be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me in the middle at $10000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $8000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $12000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be beneficial for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $8000, and I was thinking we could meet in the middle at $10000. However, I'm also open to considering a price slightly above that. Can you meet me at $9500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9500 is still below what the product is truly worth to me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10750.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your budget while ensuring I can also get a reasonable price for the product. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
