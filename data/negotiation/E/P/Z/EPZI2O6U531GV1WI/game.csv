"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is not as high as $1,200,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still firm on the value of this product.  To reflect both our needs, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price is still a great deal for you, considering the potential returns, and it allows me to get closer to the value I've placed on it.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
