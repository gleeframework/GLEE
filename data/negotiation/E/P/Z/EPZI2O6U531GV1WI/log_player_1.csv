{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for you, given its potential to generate significant returns.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is not as high as $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than my minimum, I believe we can still negotiate a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still firm on the value of this product.  To reflect both our needs, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.

Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can secure a better deal. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer in the next round, aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000 again, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, we're nearing the end of negotiations and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. $1,050,000 is a significant amount, and it's better than selling to John for $800,000."
