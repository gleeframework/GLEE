Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and the fact that it's worth $10,000 to you, I propose we start our negotiation at $12,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to buy, but my budget is $10,000. Let's see if we can find common ground at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
