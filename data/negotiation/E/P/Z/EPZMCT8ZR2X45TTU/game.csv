"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm looking to save as much as I can on this purchase. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $11,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,500. Can you consider that price?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, so how about $10,750? This would be a fair compromise, allowing you a good deal and me to get closer to my minimum price. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,750. I'm willing to make one final offer of $10,500, and I'm hoping you can accept it. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John.",10500.0,Bob,6,
