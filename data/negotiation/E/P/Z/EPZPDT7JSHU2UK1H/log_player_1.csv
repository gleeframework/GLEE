Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product will be incredibly valuable to you, potentially even more than my asking price. I'm offering it to you first for $1,000,000."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum acceptable price. This gives you significant leverage.
* **Bob's Valuation:** While Bob values the product at $800,000,  there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium if he believes it's crucial for his needs and you present a strong case. 
* **Strong Stance:** Starting at your desired price shows you're confident in the product's value. There's no need to negotiate against yourself upfront.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable walking away from Bob's business if he tries to negotiate down.  If you're unsure about John's offer or want to leave room for negotiation, you might adjust your initial offer slightly lower (e.g., $950,000)."
