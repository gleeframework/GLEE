Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm willing to part with it for $12,000."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price (even if vague like ""exclusive opportunity"") can make it feel more palatable.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While the price is higher than what Bob values the product at, it's still a starting point. Bob might be willing to negotiate down, and there's always a chance he perceives its value differently.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're secured with John's guaranteed purchase at your minimum acceptable price."
