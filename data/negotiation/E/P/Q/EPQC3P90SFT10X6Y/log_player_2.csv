"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this fantastic product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's value to her, it's still significantly higher than your $80 limit and what John is offering. Buying from John gets you the best price."
