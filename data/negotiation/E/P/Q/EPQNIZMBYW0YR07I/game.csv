"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,250 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $8,700.  Would that work for you?",8700.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a great deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $8,700 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,000, but that's my final offer.  This is a fantastic deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,
