"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $170 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $130. I'm willing to make another adjustment and offer it to you for $142.50. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",142.5,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However, $142.50 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm sticking to my offer of $130. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",130.0,Bob,6,
