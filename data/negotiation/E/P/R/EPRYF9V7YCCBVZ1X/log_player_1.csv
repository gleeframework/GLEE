{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $15,000. It's a real steal, considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is significantly higher than your minimum value, but it's still within a range that might be appealing to Bob. It also opens the negotiation by framing it as a potential ""steal"" for Bob, which could incentivize him to consider accepting your offer.  

This initial offer also leaves room for negotiation, as Bob is likely to counter with a lower price. We'll need to assess his counteroffer and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $15000 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $12000 at this time.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than our minimum value, it's still significantly lower than our initial asking price. We want to try and maximize our profit, so we'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to our initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This reflects the incredible value of the product and gives you a great deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 
This counteroffer bridges the gap between our initial offer and Bob's offer, signaling our willingness to negotiate while still holding out for a price closer to our ideal value. It also re-emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider accepting our offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise and represents a decent profit for us. While we could potentially try to squeeze out another $1,000, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether.  Accepting this offer secures a profitable sale and avoids the uncertainty of continuing the negotiation."
