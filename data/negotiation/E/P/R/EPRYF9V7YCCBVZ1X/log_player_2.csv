"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $15000. It's a real steal, considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're looking to save as much money as possible, accepting Alice's offer at $15,000 doesn't achieve that goal.  Buying from John for $15,000 is also not optimal if there's a chance to get a lower price from Alice.  

Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal. It's the most strategic option at this point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $14000. This reflects the incredible value of the product and gives you a great deal. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $14,000, which is closer to your target price of $12,000. However, you're still aiming for a lower price. Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation open and gives you another opportunity to counter and hopefully reach a price you're comfortable with."
