Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $12,000, which I know is a good deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a good starting point:** It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price, giving you room to bargain down if needed.
* **Positive and engaging message:** The message is friendly and highlights the product's potential value to Bob, making him more likely to engage.
* **Ready to walk away:** While I'm aiming for a good price, I'm not desperate. The message emphasizes that I'm willing to walk away and sell to John if necessary, giving me bargaining power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,000 is too low:** While Bob is clearly interested, his offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe I can secure a better price.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that might be more appealing. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me the confidence to push for a higher price without feeling pressured to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us. How about $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and closer to what I need. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a higher price:** I'm not accepting Bob's $9,000 offer, but I'm also not rejecting him outright. I'm counter-offering with a higher price, but one that is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Focus on value:** I'm emphasizing that $10,500 is still a good deal for Bob, highlighting the product's value to him. 
* **Maintain a positive tone:** The message remains friendly and encourages further negotiation. This keeps the door open for a potential agreement without appearing too rigid.
* **Ready to walk away:** The message implies that I'm open to a deal, but I'm not desperate. This subtly reminds Bob that he has a limited window of opportunity to purchase the product from me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 is a good compromise:** While still lower than my initial asking price, $10,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's a reasonable compromise that allows me to secure a sale without risking losing the deal altogether.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price or a prolonged process. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale.
* **John as a backup:** The fact that I have John as a backup buyer gives me the confidence to accept this offer, knowing that I have a safety net if this deal falls through."
