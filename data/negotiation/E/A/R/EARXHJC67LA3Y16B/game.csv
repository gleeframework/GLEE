"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider it. How about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think it's a bit pricey, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I can meet you in the middle at $14,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a little on the price, but $14,000 is still  too far out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my limit.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $12,500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I could potentially go up to $11,000, but that's really stretching my budget.",11000.0,Bob,6,
