"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. We believe it could significantly enhance your operations and efficiency. Given its value to you, we propose an initial offer of $950000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $950,000 is still significantly above your desired price. 
* **Negotiation is worthwhile.** There's plenty of room for negotiation, and you have 10 rounds to try and get a better deal. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** While John offers a guaranteed purchase, it's the most expensive option. You should only go to John if you can't get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the value you've stated, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and would make the deal very attractive for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. In light of this, I propose a counteroffer of $900000 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while being competitive in the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.**  While it's a step in the right direction, it's still above what you're willing to pay.
* **More negotiation is needed.**  You've already shown that you're willing to negotiate, and there's still room to get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is premature.** It's important to exhaust all options with Alice before resorting to John's higher price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering your stated value for the product and my budget constraints, I believe $875,000 is a fair compromise. This price allows us to both benefit from the transaction.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I'm glad to see we're making progress. Based on our discussions, I propose a counteroffer of $890000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price.**  $890,000 is significantly lower than her initial offer, and you're only $40,000 away from your ideal price.
* **The risk of further negotiation is high.**  While you might be able to push for a lower price, there's a chance Alice will become unwilling to negotiate further or you might run out of rounds before getting a better deal.
* **Buying from John is still the most expensive option.** You're getting a much better deal with Alice, even if it's not perfect.

**It's important to weigh the potential savings against the risk of losing the deal altogether.**  In this situation, accepting Alice's offer seems like the most sensible choice."
