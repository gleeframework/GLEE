Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is $200,000 more than your minimum acceptable price, giving you a good profit. It's also lower than Bob's perceived value, meaning he has room to negotiate if he wants the product. This strategy balances maximizing your profit with a reasonable chance of Bob accepting the offer."
