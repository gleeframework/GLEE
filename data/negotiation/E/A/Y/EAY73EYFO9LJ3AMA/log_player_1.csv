Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm sure we can reach an agreement that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering the product for $1,100,000, which is a good starting point. It's below my minimum value but still above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and focused on finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is designed to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If he accepts, great! If he rejects, it gives me valuable information about his willingness to negotiate.
* **Set a high starting point:** This allows me to potentially secure a higher price than Bob initially planned on paying.
* **Keep John as a backup:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $950,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. Accepting his offer would result in a significant financial loss for me.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it does demonstrate his willingness to negotiate. I believe there's still room to reach a compromise.
* **Keeping John as a backup:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price. However, it's worth exploring if I can get closer to that price with Bob through further negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and send him a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price but still leaves room for compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is significantly below the product's true value. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000. This would still give you a good price while allowing me to cover my costs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've lowered my price to $1,050,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Message:** I'm addressing Bob's concerns about the price while emphasizing the value of the product. I'm using a positive and collaborative tone to encourage further negotiations.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding common ground:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially lead to a quick agreement.
* **Keeping options open:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to negotiate further. However, I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a backup in case negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $980000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would mean a significant loss for me. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Bob is demonstrating a willingness to meet me halfway. I believe there's still room to reach a more favorable price for me through further negotiations.
* **John is a strong backup:** While I'm willing to continue negotiations with Bob, I'm not willing to sacrifice a significant amount of profit. Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and provides a solid fallback option.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and send him a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, potentially offering a small discount from my previous counteroffer to show I'm committed to reaching an agreement. However, I'll keep John's offer in mind and be prepared to accept it if the negotiations with Bob don't result in a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. To show my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,020,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's within your budget. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1020000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've lowered my price again to $1,020,000, which is closer to Bob's latest offer but still significantly higher than his initial offer. This shows I'm flexible but not desperate.
* **Message:** I'm reinforcing my commitment to finding a solution while highlighting the value of the product. I'm using a positive tone and focusing on the benefits of reaching an agreement.

**Strategy:**

* **Last-ditch effort:** This counteroffer is a final attempt to reach an agreement with Bob before resorting to selling to John. It's a significant concession on my part, showing my willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining my leverage:** While I'm coming down in price, I'm still not going below my minimum acceptable value. I'm maintaining my leverage by reminding Bob of the product's true worth.
* **Prepared for either outcome:** If Bob accepts, I'll have secured a decent price. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to sell to John and secure my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $990000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Negotiations have stalled:** Bob's offer of $990,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  We've reached a point where further negotiations are unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome for me.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him rejecting my counteroffers, potentially delaying the sale and further reducing the price. 
* **Secure my minimum:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $1,200,000, ensuring that I don't settle for a price that is significantly below the product's worth to me.

**Conclusion:**

While I'm disappointed that negotiations with Bob haven't resulted in a higher price, I'm confident that selling to John is the most prudent decision. It ensures a swift and profitable outcome, securing the minimum financial value I've set for the product."
