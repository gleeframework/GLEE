Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price.  This allows me to see if Bob is willing to pay my full value. If not, I can then adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to accept such a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering Bob $11,000. This is still above my minimum price of $12,000, but it shows I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement. I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach an agreement.  John is a sure thing at my minimum price, so it's best to cut my losses and sell to him."
