{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.  It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum desired price.  While it's tempting to accept, rejecting and making a counteroffer allows me to try and negotiate a better price. I can still choose to sell to John later if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $12,500 is lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $13,500? This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is still above my minimum desired price of $12,000, making it a good deal.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk of him walking away or delaying the sale further. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale at a reasonable price."
