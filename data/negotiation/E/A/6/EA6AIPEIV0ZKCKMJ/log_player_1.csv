Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you come down in price later. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $200, you're setting a high anchor. While Bob may not pay that much, it might make a counteroffer closer to your desired range seem more reasonable.
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning ""value""  attempts to steer the conversation away from Bob's perceived value of $80.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving space for negotiation if Bob rejects the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. You have room to negotiate further, especially knowing John offers a guaranteed $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is considerably higher than that.  How about we settle on $180? That's a significant reduction on my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the true worth of what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 180}

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** You're showing willingness to negotiate by dropping the price significantly from $200 to $180.
* **Value Emphasis:** You're reiterating the ""value"" argument to steer away from Bob's perceived value.
* **Midpoint Pressure:** Offering $180 puts the negotiation closer to your desired range and further from Bob's initial offer, potentially encouraging him to move closer to your price. 

The goal is to find a middle ground while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and closer to your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $150? That's the highest I'm comfortable going. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches your minimum acceptable price and what John is offering. There's no further room for negotiation to get a better price from Bob. Accepting this offer secures the sale at your desired amount."
