Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,000,000 is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the value proposition for Bob while also emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  A $1,000,000 sale is significantly better than selling to John for $1,200,000, and could potentially lead to an even higher price if Bob counteroffers.
* **Encourage negotiation:** By leaving room for negotiation, it encourages Bob to engage in a dialogue, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Avoid immediate rejection:** A lower opening price makes rejection less likely, giving me a chance to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that high. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your needs and my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than the product's value to me ($1,200,000). 
* **Potential for negotiation:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering. 
* **Avoiding selling to John:** Selling to John guarantees a high price, but I'm not desperate to sell. 

**Reasoning:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can maintain control and try to secure a more favorable deal. I believe I can convince Bob to pay a higher price through counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's current offer. 
* **Reasoning with value:** I reinforce the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider a higher price.
* **Positive message:**  The message remains friendly and emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain leverage:**  This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price higher than Bob's initial offer. 
* **Increased chances of a deal:** This compromise makes a deal more likely while keeping the price within a range that is still profitable for me. 
* **Signal flexibility:**  Showing flexibility encourages Bob to continue negotiations and potentially increase his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a good middle ground that reflects the value of the product and my budget. Let's try to find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my target:** $900,000 is significantly closer to my target of $1,000,000 than Bob's previous offers.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Rejecting this offer might lead to further counteroffers, potentially dropping the price lower. 
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take time and energy, potentially leading to a delay in selling the product.

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price,  $900,000 is a solid deal that minimizes risk and provides a quick sale.  Selling to John would guarantee a higher price, but this deal is still profitable and allows me to avoid the uncertainty of further negotiations."
