Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a strong anchor. While it's unlikely Bob will accept this initial price, it gives Alice room to negotiate down.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits,"" Alice subtly suggests the product might be worth more than Bob initially thinks.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The phrase ""initially proposing"" signals Alice is open to negotiation, making Bob more likely to engage rather than walk away immediately.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, so she's not desperate. This allows her to confidently aim high with Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a chance to buy the product."
