"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a fair price. My asking price is $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $11,500 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your business, $10,500 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to accept $11,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $10,750.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate.  $10,750 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $10,900.  This is my final offer before I have to consider other options.",10900.0,Alice,5,
