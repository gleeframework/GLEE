Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a fair price. My asking price is $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $11,500 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still potentially get a better price. While $10,500 is better than John's offer, I believe there's room for negotiation with Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your business, $10,500 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to accept $11,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $10,750.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a higher offer. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate.  $10,750 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $10,900.  This is my final offer before I have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 10900}
