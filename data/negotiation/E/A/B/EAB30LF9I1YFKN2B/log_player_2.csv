"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget. You should definitely counter-offer with a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80?"",
 ""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it leaves room for negotiation while still staying well below your $100 maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $80 is quite a bit below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $115 is still over your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we split the difference and do $97.50?"",
 ""product_price"": 97.50
}
```

This counteroffer:

* Shows you're willing to negotiate.
* Stays below your $100 limit.
* Aims for a price that's hopefully acceptable to Alice."
