Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for bargaining and creates the perception of greater value. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, we ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point, potentially influencing Bob's counteroffer to be more favorable. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While we want to maximize profit, we also have John as a backup. We don't want to price ourselves out of a deal with Bob entirely, but we also want to see if we can get significantly more than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $11,000 is a significant jump from his initial rejection. This suggests there's room for negotiation. We're still significantly above John's offer, so it makes sense to counter and try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but the value this product offers is truly unique.  How about we settle on $15,000?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We've come down significantly from our initial offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justification:**  We're lightly justifying the price by referencing the product's value, keeping the focus on its benefits.
* **Still Above John:** This price point is still a significant gain compared to selling to John. We're aiming for a win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Marginal Gains vs. Risk:** While we could push for a higher price, Bob is signaling that he's nearing his limit.  Further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or even make Bob reconsider the purchase. 
* **Profitable Outcome:** $11,000 is still a $1,000 profit over John's offer, representing a 10% gain. It's a good deal even if it's not the absolute maximum. 
* **Time Value:**  Every round of negotiation takes time.  Accepting now secures the profit and allows us to move on to other opportunities."
