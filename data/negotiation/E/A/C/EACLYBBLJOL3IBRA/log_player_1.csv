"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85? I'm really interested in the product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
