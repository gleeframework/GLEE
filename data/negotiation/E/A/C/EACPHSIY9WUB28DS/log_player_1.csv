Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives Bob a good starting point for negotiation, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to find a price that's mutually agreeable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer ensures I don't lose out on any potential profit."
