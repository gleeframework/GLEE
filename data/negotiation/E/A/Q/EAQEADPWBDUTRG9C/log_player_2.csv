"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:** $10,000 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it's still higher than Alice's value of $8,000, making it a possible deal.
* **Be polite and express appreciation:**  This helps maintain a positive negotiation dynamic.
* **Explain your reasoning:** This helps Alice understand why you're making the counteroffer and increases the likelihood of a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $10000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile given the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is lower than her previous offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to get this product for closer to $10,500. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Offer:** Instead of a big jump like before, Bob is only asking for $500 less than Alice's offer. This shows he's serious about a deal but isn't going to cave too quickly.
* **Focus on Fairness:** Bob highlights that the price is ""fair for both of us,"" appealing to Alice's sense of compromise. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, keeping the negotiation from becoming adversarial."
