"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. By setting a price closer to the middle ground, I can potentially incentivize Bob to accept the offer while also ensuring I get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob, given he values the product at $15,000. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile given the value the product holds for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to get this product for closer to $10500. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to my desired price point. While I'd prefer to get closer to $11,000,  I'm comfortable accepting this offer. Accepting now ensures a sale and avoids further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower offer or even a rejection, pushing me to sell to John for $8,000."
