Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm offering a price higher than my minimum, but still significantly lower than the value Bob places on the product. This gives him room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit for me.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, making Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm not setting a hard line with this offer, leaving room to adjust depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $90.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's counteroffer is very close to my target price of $100. 
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob entirely, and I'm already getting a decent price. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to John for $80 represents a significant opportunity cost. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a better profit."
