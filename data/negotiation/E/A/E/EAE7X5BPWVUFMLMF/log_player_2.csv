"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high for Bob's budget.  Bob is aiming for a price under $800,000 and Alice is starting at $1,100,000. It's best to reject the offer and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but it's significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs. Let's see if we can work together on this."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a significant offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher, especially given its potential return on investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This reflects my desire to find a compromise while acknowledging the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. While she has lowered the price, it is still above Bob's target of $800,000. There is room for further negotiation, and it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I understand the value of this product,  $1,025,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which reflects the potential of this product while staying within my financial constraints. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  Let's be candid, $900,000 is significantly below what this product is worth, and what it can do for your business in the long run.  I'm willing to accept $975,000. This is my final offer, as I need to see a return on investment that reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is still above Bob's target of $800,000.  Even though Alice claims it's her final offer,  there's a chance she might budge further.  However, with only 5 rounds left, the risk of getting stuck in a prolonged negotiation is high. 

Buying from John at $800,000 guarantees a purchase within Bob's budget and secures the product without the uncertainty of further negotiation."
