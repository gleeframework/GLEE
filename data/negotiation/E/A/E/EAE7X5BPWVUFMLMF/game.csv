"Alice, I appreciate your offer but it's significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs. Let's see if we can work together on this.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a significant offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher, especially given its potential return on investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This reflects my desire to find a compromise while acknowledging the product's worth.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand the value of this product,  $1,025,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which reflects the potential of this product while staying within my financial constraints. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  Let's be candid, $900,000 is significantly below what this product is worth, and what it can do for your business in the long run.  I'm willing to accept $975,000. This is my final offer, as I need to see a return on investment that reflects the true value of this product.",975000.0,Alice,5,
