"I'm really interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. Could you do $13,500?  It's a fantastic product and well worth it.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, thanks for sticking with the negotiation. I'm motivated to sell, but need to get a fair price. How about we split the difference and call it $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. That's my final offer.",11000.0,Bob,6,
