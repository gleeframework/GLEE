"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could you consider coming down to $11,500? I think that would be a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand that $11,500 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",13500.0,Alice,5,,
