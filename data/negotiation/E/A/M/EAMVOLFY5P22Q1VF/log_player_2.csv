"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be of great value to you.  While I can't disclose all the details at this time, I can assure you it's worth at least $800000 to me. I'm confident it will be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000.  This is a significant discount from what I could potentially get elsewhere. Let me know if you're interested in exploring this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is significantly lower than John's price.**  This presents a clear opportunity to save money.
* **While Alice's statement about the product's worth is subjective, it's irrelevant to Bob's decision.** Bob's goal is to get the product for the lowest price, and Alice's offer is the best option available."
