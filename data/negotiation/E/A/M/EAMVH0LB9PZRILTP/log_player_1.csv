{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a fantastic opportunity and I think you'll find it's a great value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts with a relatively high price, giving me some room to negotiate downwards. However, it's still below the value of $10,000 I've set for myself, leaving some room for profit. 

The message is friendly and inviting, aiming to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $15000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in your product but I'm only able to go up to $8000 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  While I'm interested in selling the product, I'm not willing to accept a price that doesn't cover my minimum.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  I understand that $8,000 is your budget, but I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which I think is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

This counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer, but it remains above my minimum value. By explaining my reasoning and proposing a compromise, I'm aiming to show flexibility and encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $12000, but I'm still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9500.  If we can meet in the middle, I think we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my ideal price, but it's above my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  This is a good compromise, especially since I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for $10,000 if negotiations with Bob fail.  I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
