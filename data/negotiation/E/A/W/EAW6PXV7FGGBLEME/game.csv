"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. While it seems valuable, $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know your thoughts.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,250. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What are your thoughts?",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,250 is still a bit too high for me. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm prepared to offer $13,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us. I hope you'll consider it.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually beneficial price. However, $13,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,500, which is my absolute minimum. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I'm getting closer to your minimum, $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to go up to $13,200 for the product. This is a significant step for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions. Let's see if we can finally close this deal.",13200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $13,200, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with that price. Considering we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,350. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",13350.0,Alice,7,
