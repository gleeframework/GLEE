"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000, which is a fair market value considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's flexibility. This leaves room for negotiation while still staying within a reasonable range of our target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it's a significant discount from the original price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to our desired price range, $950,000 is still significantly higher than our ideal price and what John is offering. We have room to negotiate further and should aim to get closer to the $800,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still quite interested but $950,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? That's a fair offer considering the value it holds for me."",
""product_price"": 825000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* We acknowledge Alice's movement on price and reiterate our interest.
* Our counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between her last offer ($950,000) and our previous counteroffer ($700,000). 
* This keeps us in the negotiation while moving closer to our ideal price and staying below John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $825,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. I can offer you a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000 is a bit too high, but I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but slowly.  She is now claiming this is her lowest offer. However, it's still significantly above John's price.  We will push Alice a bit further to see if she is willing to negotiate more aggressively before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your bottom line, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  I can offer you $850,000. This is a very competitive offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* We acknowledge Alice's ""bottom line"" statement but hold firm on our need for a lower price.
* This counteroffer splits the difference between her last offer ($900,000) and our previous offer ($825,000).
* We're getting closer to John's price, putting pressure on Alice while still leaving some room for negotiation if she's truly unwilling to go that low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $925,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to cut our losses. Alice seems unwilling to budge significantly from the $900,000 range. While we might be able to negotiate her down slightly in subsequent rounds, it's unlikely to be a substantial difference. John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000, saving us at least $125,000. This is a significant saving and outweighs the potential benefit of continuing to negotiate with Alice."
