"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get a good price, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,125,000, so how about $1,112,500? That's the highest I can go.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
