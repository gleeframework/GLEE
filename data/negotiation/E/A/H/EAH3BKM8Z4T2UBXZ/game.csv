"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get good value from the product.",135.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $132? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",132.0,Bob,4,
