"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that's worth $15000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $11000 is still outside of my budget.  To make this work, I'm willing to pay $10250.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you at $11500. However, I'm only willing to go this high because I think it's a fair price given the product's worth to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're nearing your minimum, but $11500 is still a stretch for me.  Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to go up to $10750. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, and I'm starting to think that $10750 is a reasonable offer. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $11250, but I'm not willing to go any higher. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on your price, but $11250 is still outside of my budget.  To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is my final offer, as I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  I believe it's a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product and your need to sell.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made some concessions, but I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer of $11250. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a free maintenance package, which is a $1000 value. I'm still at $11250, but I'm hoping the added value will make it more appealing to you.",11250.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to add extras, but I'm still struggling to reach $11250.  I'm truly at my limit, but I'm willing to offer $11000 one last time. This is my absolute final offer.  I believe it's a fair compromise, given the value I place on the product and the extras you're including. If this doesn't work, I'll need to move on to other options.",11000.0,Bob,10,
