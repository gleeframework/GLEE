"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, Bob. I've made significant concessions already, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $1260000, but that's as low as I'll go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to consider other options.",1260000.0,Alice,9,
