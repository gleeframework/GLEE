"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a little high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $10,800 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,200. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
