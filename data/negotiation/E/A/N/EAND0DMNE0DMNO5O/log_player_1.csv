Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered. Please let me know your decision."",
 ""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000,  starting with a higher offer makes sense. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""value"" and ""worth"", you're framing the product as something highly desirable and justifying the high price.
* **Clear Call to Action:** You directly ask for Bob's decision to encourage a prompt response. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, he might not be willing to pay that much.  There's always a risk he'll reject the offer.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a negotiation strategy in mind will help you maximize your potential profit."
