Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you're in a strong position. Starting high allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Justified Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""immense value and potential"" to justify the high price.
* **Confidence:**  Projecting confidence can influence Bob's perception of the product's value.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:**  Excellent outcome â€“ you achieve a higher profit margin.
* **Bob negotiates:** You have room to lower the price while still aiming for above $1,500,000.
* **Bob rejects:** You still sell to John at your minimum acceptable price."
