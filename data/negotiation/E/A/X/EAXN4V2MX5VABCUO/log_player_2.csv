Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value this product offers is truly unique, and $900,000 undervalues it significantly.  Could you consider $1,050,000?  I'm willing to be flexible, but I believe this price reflects its true worth.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground.  While $950,000 is closer to what I envisioned, I'm still hesitant to go that low.  How about we settle at $1,000,000 even? This offer stands as a firm reflection of the product's value.
