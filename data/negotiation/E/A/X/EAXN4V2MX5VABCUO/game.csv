"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value this product offers is truly unique, and $900,000 undervalues it significantly.  Could you consider $1,050,000?  I'm willing to be flexible, but I believe this price reflects its true worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground.  While $950,000 is closer to what I envisioned, I'm still hesitant to go that low.  How about we settle at $1,000,000 even? This offer stands as a firm reflection of the product's value.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still committed to the product's value, but I'm willing to go up to $980,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product, and I'm willing to meet you at this point.",980000.0,Bob,6,
