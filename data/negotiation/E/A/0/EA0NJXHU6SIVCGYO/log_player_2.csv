Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of this, I am willing to consider your offer. However, I must maintain a fair valuation for our product. Therefore, I propose a counteroffer of $1,150,000 for the product. This reflects a compromise while still ensuring a reasonable return for us. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer.  There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting this offer gives Bob another chance to push for a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement. In order to move forward, I am willing to consider your latest offer. However, to ensure a mutually beneficial transaction, I propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for the product. This proposal represents a compromise that maintains a fair value for our product while acknowledging your budgetary constraints. I hope this proposal aligns with your expectations, and we can finalize the deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's desired price point, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Potential Savings:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the potential savings from another counteroffer might be minimal, and the risk of Alice rejecting the deal entirely increases.
* **Alternative Cost:** Buying from John would be significantly more expensive. 

At this point, accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob acquires the product at a price that is a good compromise, saving him a significant amount compared to buying from John."
