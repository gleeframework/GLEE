"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that I believe holds immense value for you. This product, which has been meticulously crafted and tailored to meet your specific needs, is priced at $950,000. My goal is to ensure that both parties benefit from this transaction, and I am confident that this offer strikes a balance between the intrinsic worth of the product and its potential impact on your endeavors.

Please consider this proposal carefully. Should you find it suitable and wish to proceed, I am more than ready to facilitate the next steps. If you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Looking forward to your positive response,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $950,000, which is too high. I'll consider buying the product from John for $800,000 instead.
