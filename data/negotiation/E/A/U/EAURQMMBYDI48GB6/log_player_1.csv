"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product could be valuable, but $1,400,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
$1,100,000 is too low, but I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $1,250,000.  This reflects the true value of this product and gives you a significant saving compared to the initial price."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about $1,175,000? This offer reflects my serious interest in the product while staying within a reasonable budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still confident we can reach a better price. $1,175,000 is still too low, but I want to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,175,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,212,500. This offer is a significant compromise on my part and provides you with a substantial benefit.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1212500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me on the price. To be completely transparent, my absolute limit is $1,200,000.  If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $1,200,000 is a good deal and keeps the negotiation moving forward.  It's important to secure the sale before more time passes and the risk of John's offer becoming more appealing increases."
