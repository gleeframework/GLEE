"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. This is an exceptional value considering its worth to you is $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You can get the product for cheaper from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price with her."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. Let me propose a price of $90 for the product. I believe this strikes a balance between the value you see in it and my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $90 is better than $95, you can still get the product for $85 from John. It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $90 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $87?  I'm really hoping to close this deal, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product, how about $89? It's a slight increase from your last offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $89 is the best you've gotten so far.  While John will sell it to you for $85, you've already rejected Alice's offer of $87, and it's likely she won't go lower. It's worth accepting Alice's offer to get the product at a slightly higher price but still within your budget and before having to go to John."
