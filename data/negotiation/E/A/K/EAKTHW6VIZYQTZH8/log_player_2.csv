Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, so I'm willing to meet you at $90. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below $90, and we have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $80 from John. It's not worth risking further negotiation rounds for a potential $10 saving."
