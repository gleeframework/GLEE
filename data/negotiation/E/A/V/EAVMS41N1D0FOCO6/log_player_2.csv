"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You value the product at $120, and Alice's offer is $110.  While this is better than buying from John, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer splits the difference between your desired price ($120) and Alice's offer ($110). It's a reasonable compromise that shows you're serious about buying but are still looking for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer is $115. This is still a better deal than buying from John for $120. While it's not ideal, it's a reasonable price considering the negotiation and the fact that Alice is willing to come down slightly. It's also possible that further negotiation will be fruitless, and you could risk losing the opportunity to buy from Alice altogether."
