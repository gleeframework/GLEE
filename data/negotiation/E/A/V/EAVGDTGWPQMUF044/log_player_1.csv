Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and optimistic, aiming to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the ""great deal"" aspect, implying that Bob can save money even at this price.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a decent profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer.
* I'll always keep John's $15,000 offer in mind as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $9,000 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  It's also significantly lower than my initial offer of $12,000.
* **Opportunity for Counter-Offer:**  I have the opportunity to counter-offer and potentially secure a price closer to my target.  
* **John's Offer is a Guarantee:**  While I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob, I can always sell to John for $15,000, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Bob's low offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my target value.
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I will re-evaluate the situation and potentially proceed with selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal for you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by dropping my price from $12,000 to $10,500. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $10,500 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, so I'm not giving away too much.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm reminding Bob of the ""great deal"" aspect, suggesting he can still save money by accepting my counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a decent price.
* If Bob rejects, I will re-evaluate the situation and decide whether to counter-offer again or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but unfortunately, I can't go above $9,000 for the product. I hope we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has remained firm at $9,000, and I've already lowered my price significantly from my initial offer. Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a substantially better price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer of $15,000 guarantees me a profit that meets my minimum requirement and is significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and could potentially lead to a lower price or a breakdown in negotiations. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $15,000."
