Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you. I'm asking for $1,300,000, a price that reflects its significant worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming higher with Bob first allows you to potentially maximize your profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Setting the price at $1,300,000 creates a substantial profit margin while still offering Bob a price significantly lower than its value to you.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob if he tries to lower the price. 

This strategy prioritizes getting the best possible deal from Bob while ensuring you don't miss out on a guaranteed sale to John."
