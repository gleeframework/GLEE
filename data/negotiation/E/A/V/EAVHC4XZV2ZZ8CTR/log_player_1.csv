Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. It's a fantastic deal!"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible, while still exceeding your minimum selling price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price that's still very beneficial for you.
* **Guaranteed Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's negotiation style and your risk tolerance, you might adjust your initial offer."
