Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a reasonable starting point. It's below my minimum value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation while still being a profitable deal for me. It also signals to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

$9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000, and even lower than the value the product holds for Bob ($10,000). I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep price drop. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  I'm willing to move a little on my price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$10,000 is the value Bob places on the product, and while it's below my minimum of $15,000, it's a reasonable compromise and a good deal for both of us. It's also closer to my desired price than my last counteroffer, so I'm happy to accept it."
