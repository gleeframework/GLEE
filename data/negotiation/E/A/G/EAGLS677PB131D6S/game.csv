"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I do see its potential. However, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get an amazing deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay at this time.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000 for the product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go below $950,000. I think the product's value is worth more than that, and I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I'm offering it to you for $925,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get an amazing deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.  I'll offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal.  Let's see if we can finally come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that we're close, but I'm not willing to go below $900,000. I think the product's value is still worth more than that.
