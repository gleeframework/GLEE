Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're getting closer to a price point, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,225,000. This is the lowest price I can accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I'm not losing too much profit. Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing willingness to negotiate, she's still significantly above your alternative offer from John. At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation with Alice are outweighed by the risk that she won't budge further. You have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,200,000, which is a good deal considering your $1,200,000 maximum."
