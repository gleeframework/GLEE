"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way over his budget.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to buy this product but I'm only able to go as high as $12,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $15,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair deal considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $15,000 is closer to Bob's budget, he can still do better. He should try to negotiate further and see if Alice will go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still a little higher than I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's my absolute limit. I'm confident this product will be a great investment, and I'm eager to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're eager to finalize the deal, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $13,000. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached his limit. He's already countered twice and Alice is still above his maximum budget.  At this point, it's better to take the guaranteed deal with John.  Even though John's offer is more expensive than Alice's final offer, it's still within Bob's budget and saves him the potential of further rounds of negotiation."
