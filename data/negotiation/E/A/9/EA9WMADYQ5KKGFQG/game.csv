"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and the need for a quick transaction. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you place on the product and the need for a quick transaction.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering the value we both place on the product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,250,000 is a tough pill to swallow, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,275,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product holds for you. I'm confident that this price is still a fair compromise.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
