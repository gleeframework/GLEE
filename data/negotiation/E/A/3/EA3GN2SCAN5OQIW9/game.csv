"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is significantly below the value I know this product holds. To show my willingness to reach an agreement, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,350,000. This offer is still fair to both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset while ensuring I receive a reasonable return.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,275,000. This price should be more in line with what I'm comfortable paying.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm still not quite comfortable with that price. While I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, $1,275,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This price is still within a reasonable range for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to make another compromise, so I'm counteroffering $1,225,000. This price should be more in line with my budget and what I'm comfortable paying.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
