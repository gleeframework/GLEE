"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm happy to get my minimum price, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves me with a profit. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,600,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with John's offer of $1,500,000."
