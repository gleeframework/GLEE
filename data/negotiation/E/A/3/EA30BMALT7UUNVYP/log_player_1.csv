"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while also hopefully triggering Bob's interest and revealing his potential value assessment of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is still significantly lower than my starting price, and I believe I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving some room for negotiation. Hopefully, this shows good faith and encourages Bob to come up a bit more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my target, I'm not yet willing to sell for less than $1,300,000.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000. I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still holding out for a price closer to my initial target. With only 5 rounds left, I need to start getting closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, we're close to the middle ground and with only 4 rounds remaining, I need to make a decision. It's better than selling to John for $1,000,000, and I can't be sure I'll get a higher offer from Bob in the next few rounds."
