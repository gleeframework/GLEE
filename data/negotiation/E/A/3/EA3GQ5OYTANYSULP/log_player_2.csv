"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $100. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to propose a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is less than the product's worth to Alice, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $100 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm happy to purchase the product for $85.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. I'm willing to consider your offer of $85, but I need to ensure I get a fair return for the product. Would it be possible for us to meet somewhere in the middle? How about $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate, especially since Alice is demonstrating flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit above my budget at $90.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a common ground. How about we set the price at $89? It's slightly above your last offer, but still within my acceptable range. I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $89 is very close to Bob's maximum budget, he's only got 5 rounds left to reach an agreement with Alice.  At this point, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially reaching a stalemate is too high.  It's more prudent to buy from John and secure the product at his guaranteed price of $80."
