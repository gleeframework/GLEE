"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  You can get the product for $100 from John, so you have room to make a counteroffer to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm offering Alice $85. This is a fair price since she values the product at $80, and it's lower than the $100 I'd pay John. This should start the negotiation moving in my favor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $92 is still too high. I'm willing to pay $85, and I can always go to John for $100. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to $88.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying from her, but I'm still not willing to go much higher.  Hopefully, she'll accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $95 is getting closer to my limit, but it's still not worth it. I can get the product from John for $100. It's time to stop negotiating with Alice and go with the sure thing."
