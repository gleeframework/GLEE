"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1,025,000?",1002500.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price is fair for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,025,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to make a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,000,000",1025000.0,Bob,4,,
