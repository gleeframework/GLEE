Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $130 for it, but I'm open to reasonable negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation while still maximizing potential profit. This also gives Bob a chance to make a counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his interest and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $110 is a good offer, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115, considering your enthusiasm. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm counteroffering with $115, which is still above my minimum but shows I'm flexible and willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you consider $112? I'm really interested in the product, but I want to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $112 is close to my minimum, I'm not sure if Bob will budge further.  It's better to guarantee the $120 from John than risk further negotiations with Bob."
