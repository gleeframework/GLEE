"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's close this deal quickly!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at a high price, but still lower than the product's worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I highlight the product's value to Bob to create a sense of urgency.
* **Time-sensitive:**  I emphasize the need for a quick decision to push Bob towards accepting. 

This approach aims to get a good starting point while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my desired minimum of $800,000. I'm not willing to sell at that price. 
* **Opportunity to counter:**  I have 10 rounds, so rejecting the offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is a last resort:** While John's offer is secure, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  This product is worth significantly more to you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects both our interests.  Let's close the deal now."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desired margin.
* **Reiterate value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to encourage him to meet me halfway.
* **Time pressure:**  I'm again emphasizing the need for a quick decision to push Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer, $1,050,000 is still below my desired minimum of $800,000.  
* **More room for negotiation:** I have several rounds left, and I believe I can push for a higher price.
* **Selling to John is still a last resort:** I'm determined to get the best possible price from Bob.

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer the product for $1,075,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to bridge the gap:** I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still staying above my minimum. This shows a willingness to compromise without jeopardizing my profit.
* **Focus on fairness:** I'm highlighting the ""fairness"" of the offer to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage him to accept. 
* **Time-sensitive language:** Again, I'm emphasizing the need to finalize the deal now to push Bob towards an agreement."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think it's a bit high. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 again, but I'll throw in an additional consideration to sweeten the deal. Can you consider this revised offer?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Even with the ""sweetener"", the price is still below my minimum of $800,000.  I'm not willing to settle for less. 
* **Negotiations are getting tense:**  Bob's insistence on $1,050,000 shows he may be unwilling to budge much further.
* **More rounds available:** I have several rounds left, giving me time to potentially push for a higher price or, if necessary, consider selling to John.

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round. I will need to be more assertive in my counteroffer, aiming to find a price closer to my desired minimum."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,050,000 is simply not enough. We've been going back and forth for several rounds now, and I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, but that's my final offer. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. If you don't accept, I'm going to have to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Assertive tone:**  The negotiation is getting tougher, so I'm using a firmer tone to signal that I'm serious about my price.
* **Finality:** I'm making it clear this is my last offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Alternative option:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have other options, including selling to John, to encourage him to accept.

This round is crucial. If Bob rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $995,000, and I'll throw in an additional consideration to make it a fair deal. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** While Bob's offer is close to my minimum of $800,000, it's still below it. 
* **Few rounds left:** With only two rounds remaining, I don't have much room to maneuver if I reject this offer. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Bob's insistence on a price below my minimum suggests he might not be willing to budge further. There's a risk of ending up with nothing if I keep negotiating and he rejects my next counteroffer.

Selling to John at $800,000 guarantees a profit and a secure deal. While it's not the ideal outcome, it's the safest option at this point."
