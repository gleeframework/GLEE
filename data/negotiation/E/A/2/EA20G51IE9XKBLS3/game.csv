"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to own this valuable item. However, I'm not quite ready to commit to $900,000 at this point. Considering the product's worth to you and my own valuation, I'd like to propose a price of $750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits us both.  Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  Considering the product's value to you and my budget constraints, I'm offering $800,000. This is a reasonable price that allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm hopeful you'll consider this offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
