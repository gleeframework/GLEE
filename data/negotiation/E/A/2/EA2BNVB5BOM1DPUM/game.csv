"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you, and it's a good price for me considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm trying to be as frugal as possible.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be frugal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $10,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet at $10,750? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not sure I can go all the way to $11,000.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up a little, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to split the difference. How about we settle on $10,875? That way we both meet in the middle and can finally close this deal.",10875.0,Alice,5,
