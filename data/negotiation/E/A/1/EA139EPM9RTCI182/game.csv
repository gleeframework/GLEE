"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business and bring significant value to your organization. As we've discussed, I'm looking to sell it to you for a price that I think is very competitive, considering its worth to you. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to your business. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree the product is valuable, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you've proposed. After reconsidering the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also being more competitive than my initial offer. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,150,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for a final price closer to $1,050,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price you've proposed. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
