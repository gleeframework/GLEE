"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,800,000. This is a fair price given the product's value and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,800,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, which might make him more inclined to consider my offer. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to engage in further discussion. 

This initial offer sets the stage for a negotiation where I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. If Bob rejects, I have several rounds to refine my offer and explore his counterproposals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1800000 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go up to $800000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting would mean a huge financial loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, he has expressed interest in the product. This suggests there is room for further negotiation.
* **Counteroffer is Needed:**  I need to counteroffer Bob to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'll need to consider his budget limitations and see if I can find a compromise that is closer to my desired range. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and have the opportunity to explore better options."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridge the Gap:**  The message focuses on finding a compromise to bridge the gap between our positions.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1400000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This is a fair price considering my financial constraints and the value I see in the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

* **Further Negotiation is Necessary:**  Despite Bob's offer being lower, I want to see if I can push for a better deal. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to explore if we can reach a price closer to my target.
* **Potential for Compromise:** I'm willing to consider a counteroffer that is slightly below my desired price, but I need to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway.

This price reflects the product's potential while also considering your budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1250000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1100000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.
