"Alice, $1800000 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go up to $800000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1400000, which is a more realistic price considering the product's potential. Let's try to bridge the gap.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1400000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This is a fair price considering my financial constraints and the value I see in the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1000000 is still below the product's true value. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This price reflects the product's potential while also considering your budget.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1250000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1100000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
