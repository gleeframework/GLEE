I'm starting high, at $1,800,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, but it also reflects the product's value to me. I'm confident I can get at least $1,200,000 from John if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's my minimum, I can likely get more. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering with $1,500,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, while still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price and a decent increase from his previous offer.  Given that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, accepting this offer seems like the best choice."
