Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) allows room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply it's worth more than Bob might think. 
* **Urgency:**  Telling Bob about listing it ""publicly"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing him to decide quickly.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Great! You get more than your minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:** This opens the door for you to potentially settle somewhere between $15,000 and $19,000. 
* **Bob Rejects:** No problem, you sell to John at your desired minimum."
