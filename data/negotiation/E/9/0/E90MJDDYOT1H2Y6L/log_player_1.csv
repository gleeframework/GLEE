Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,575,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is fair for both of us and allows us to close the deal. Let's meet in the middle.
