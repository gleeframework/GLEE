"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you as it's worth $120 to you! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. We have time and should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We want to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message aims to maintain a positive tone and presents the counteroffer as a reasonable request."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low right now. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50.  This is still a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you!  Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Room:** Alice moving towards our price is a good sign, but $92.50 is still a fair bit above our ideal. 
* **More Rounds:** We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate further and see if we can get closer to $85."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm willing to bump up my offer slightly to $88 to try and make this work. How does that sound?"",
""product_price"": 88
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:**  We're showing willingness to compromise by increasing our offer, but keeping it a small increment to signal we're getting closer to our limit.
* **Seeking Agreement:** The message emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable solution while keeping the tone positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer is getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $90. I'm sure you'll agree that this is a fair price for a product worth $120 to you. Let's finalize this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** While Alice is still moving down, the increments are getting smaller.  We need to signal that we're getting close to our limit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  We're at $90, which isn't a terrible price. However, we might be able to push Alice a little further with the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting close!  I can do $89 to make this work, but that's really the best I can offer."",
""product_price"": 89
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer signals that we're reaching our upper limit.  A small increase shows movement but makes it clear we're not budging much more. 
* **Time Pressure:** By Round 6,  we're over halfway through the rounds. This offer might nudge Alice to agree as time is running out to get a better deal."
