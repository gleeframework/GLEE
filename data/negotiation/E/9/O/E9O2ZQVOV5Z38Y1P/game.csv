"I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still looking to make a profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $140. It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to make this deal.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your guns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $155. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",155.0,Alice,5,
