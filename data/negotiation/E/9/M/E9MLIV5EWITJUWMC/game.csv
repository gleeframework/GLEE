"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, your initial price is quite high. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a significant sum and reflects its value to me. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However, the product's value is significantly higher than $1,000,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
