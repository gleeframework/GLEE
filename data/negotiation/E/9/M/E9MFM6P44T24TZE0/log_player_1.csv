Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Open to negotiation:**  By saying I'm open to negotiation, I signal that I'm willing to find a price that works for both of us. This is important for building rapport and keeping the negotiation going.
* **Positive language:**  I'm using positive language like ""great product"" and ""you'd really love it"" to create a good first impression and make Bob more likely to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not obligated to accept it right away.  I can still try to get a better price.  By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is my absolute minimum, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to go up to $90? That's a fair middle ground, and it allows me to make this deal worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:**  I start by acknowledging Bob's offer to show that I'm listening and taking his perspective into account.
* **Counter with a compromise:**  I counter with $90, which is a compromise between my initial asking price of $100 and Bob's offer of $80.
* **Justify the counteroffer:** I explain why $90 is a fair middle ground, making it more likely for Bob to accept.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I use positive language and a friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $90. Would you be willing to consider $85? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better price from him.  It's also better than selling to John for $80. Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice."
