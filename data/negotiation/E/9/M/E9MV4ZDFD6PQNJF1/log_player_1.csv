"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, and I'm willing to risk a few rounds of negotiation to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get a better price.  While $1,500,000 is my safety net, I'm confident I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm dropping my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit.  I'm showing flexibility while maintaining a strong position.  I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and might persuade Bob to come up with a higher counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price. While I would prefer a little more, accepting his offer guarantees me a significant profit. Continuing negotiations could lead to a higher offer, but also risks losing the deal entirely.  It's better to secure a good deal than to risk getting nothing."
