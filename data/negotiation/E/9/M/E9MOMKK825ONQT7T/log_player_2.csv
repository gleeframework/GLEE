Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We are down to the final few rounds, and while Alice is lowering her price, it's still above my budget. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not sure I can get her lower.  At this point, it's better to stick to my budget and buy the product from John for $12,000. It guarantees I get the product for a price I'm comfortable with."
