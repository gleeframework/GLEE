{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,200,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum. This price also makes it very likely Bob will buy, as it's significantly less than his perceived value.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 provides a safety net. However, aiming for the higher price with Bob first maximizes potential earnings."
