"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to do $125? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try and get a better price than $125. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $135? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit hesitant at $135. How about we split the difference and go with $130?  Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get closer to my initial price, $130 is a good deal considering Bob's willingness to negotiate and my limited rounds. I'll accept his offer."
