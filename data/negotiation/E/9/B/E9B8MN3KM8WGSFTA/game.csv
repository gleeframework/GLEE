"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to do $125? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $135? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit hesitant at $135. How about we split the difference and go with $130?  Let's make this happen!",130.0,Bob,4,
