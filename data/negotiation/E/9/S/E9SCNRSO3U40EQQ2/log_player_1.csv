"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $13,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm subtly emphasizing the value of the product, hoping to make Bob reconsider his initial assessment.

**Strategy:** 

I'm aiming to secure a price as close to my minimum of $15,000 as possible, but I'm also aware that Bob has a limited budget.  I'm prepared to make concessions if necessary, but I'll start by testing the waters with a high offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my interest in your product, Alice. I believe we can reach a fair agreement. Would you be open to selling the product for $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  It's also a considerable drop from my initial offer, suggesting he's not willing to compromise much.
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  I have 10 rounds to work with, so there's time to negotiate further.  A counteroffer will demonstrate my willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests. 
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I believe there's still a chance to get a better deal from Bob.

**Strategy:** 

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, but I'll be prepared to make concessions gradually as we move through the rounds. I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested in the product and willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to find a solution that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $13,000 to $11,000. This shows I'm open to negotiation but also sets a firm lower limit.
* **Highlighting Reduction:** I'm emphasizing the fact that this is a ""significant reduction"" to emphasize the value I'm offering and to encourage Bob to take the deal.
* **Seeking Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a way to find a solution that works ""for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's desire for a fair agreement.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to test Bob's willingness to compromise further. If he accepts $11,000, I've secured a good deal. If he rejects, I'll continue to lower my price gradually but strategically throughout the remaining rounds, while always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose $10,000 as the price for your product. This is a fair compromise based on its value to me and the market price. I hope this offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $10,000 is still $5,000 below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Progressing Negotiation:**  Bob has moved from his initial offer of $9,000 to $10,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. 
* **Time Constraint:** We're already in round 4, and each round brings us closer to the 10-round limit.  Accepting this offer secures a good deal without risking losing the opportunity to John.

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer a higher price,  accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic choice. It maximizes my immediate earnings, considering the potential risks of further negotiations: 
* **Time:**  There's no guarantee of a better offer in the remaining rounds.
* **John:** Selling to John at $15,000 is still an option, but this offer is a good compromise that minimizes the potential for a worse outcome."
