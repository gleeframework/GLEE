Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,150,000 is still a decent amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I want to see if I can get closer to that value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. How about $1,250,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile for me."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,225,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

``` 
Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is a good compromise and is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
