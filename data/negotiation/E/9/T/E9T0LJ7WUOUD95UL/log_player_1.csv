I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and is well above my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'll be ready to counter Bob's offer if he doesn't accept this initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000. I will counter his offer with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering with $1,300,000.  This is still well above my minimum value and closer to my initial offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate but not give away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough.  It's time to move on to my backup option and sell to John for $1,200,000.  It's a guaranteed sale and  a better price than Bob's current offer."
