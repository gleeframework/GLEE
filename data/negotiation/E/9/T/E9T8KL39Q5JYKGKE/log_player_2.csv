"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's valued at $150 by you, which aligns perfectly with its worth. I'm confident it will meet your needs and expectations. To ensure we both benefit from this transaction, I propose a price of $140 for the product. This offer allows us to share the value of the product while ensuring a fair profit for me. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still potentially save more.  You are willing to pay $150, but the product is worth $120 to Alice. There's room to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me. However, I'm aiming to get a better deal. Given your value for the product, I'd be willing to pay $135. This price still allows you to profit from the sale while offering me a significant discount. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 135}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. After careful consideration, I propose a price of $138 for the product. This allows us to find a balance between your desire for a discount and my need to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $138, which is only $3 more than my counteroffer of $135.  This is a good deal for me, as I'm still saving $12 compared to buying from John.  There's not much room for further negotiation, and I don't want to risk Alice walking away and forcing me to buy from John at a higher price."
