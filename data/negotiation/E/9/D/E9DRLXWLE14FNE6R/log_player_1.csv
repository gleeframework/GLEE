Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $800000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm willing to risk negotiating further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This reflects the true value of the product and gives you a substantial price point.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider it?

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is equal to what I would get from John. Since my goal is to maximize my profit, accepting this offer is the most logical decision."
