"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. While I can't disclose specifics about its value just yet, I assure you it's worth at least $800000 to me.  I'm willing to let you have it for $900000. This is a significant discount considering its potential value. If you're interested, I'd be happy to provide more details.  But please note, if you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is ready to pay $800000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
