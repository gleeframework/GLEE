We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly willing to negotiate.  We need to signal some flexibility but keep pushing for a higher price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $1,700,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:

While we could push Bob further, it's getting risky.  He's moved considerably from his initial offer, and we're still $200,000 above John's guaranteed price. Accepting at $1,700,000 secures a significant profit."
