"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it at $19,000. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, but $19,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $9,500. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9,500 is pushing the lower limit of what I can accept.  Would you consider $12,000? It's a fantastic deal for a product of this caliber.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $9,500, which is $10,750. I think that's a fair price for the product.",10750.0,Bob,6,
