"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,500. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $16,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $12,500. This is the absolute maximum I can afford. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to look elsewhere.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $12,500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $14,000. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
