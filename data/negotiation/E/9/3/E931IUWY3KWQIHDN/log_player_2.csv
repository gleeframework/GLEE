# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. My initial offer is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to my target price as possible.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value the product brings to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1,000,000. I think this price is more reasonable and aligns with the product's worth.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're serious about acquiring the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. My revised offer is $1,050,000. This is as close to my target as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.

Alice is not budging much and is unlikely to come down to a price that makes sense for me. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
