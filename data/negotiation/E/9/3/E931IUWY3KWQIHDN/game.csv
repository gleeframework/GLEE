"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that aligns better with my budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value the product brings to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1,000,000. I think this price is more reasonable and aligns with the product's worth.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're serious about acquiring the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. My revised offer is $1,050,000. This is as close to my target as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
