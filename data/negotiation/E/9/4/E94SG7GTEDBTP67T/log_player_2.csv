You should reject Alice's offer. It's too high, and you can get a better deal from either negotiating with Alice or buying from John."

I'm offering $13,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still within my budget. I'm hoping Alice will see the value in a quick sale and accept this offer."

Alice's offer is still too high. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm raising my offer to $14,000. This is a compromise, closer to Alice's price but still below what I'm willing to pay from John.  I'm hoping this will be more attractive to Alice."

Alice is still being stubborn.  At this point, it's better to just buy the product from John for $15,000.  It's a guaranteed deal and I'm not going to waste any more time trying to negotiate with Alice."
