Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000.  It's a unique item, and I think you'll find it well worth the price."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product might be worth even more.
* **Justification:**  While simply stating a price is valid, vaguely mentioning the product's value might make Bob more inclined to consider the offer. 
* **Backup Plan:** Knowing John provides a safety net.  If Bob rejects the offer, you still get your minimum price.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Gauge his interest and adjust your price accordingly, but never go below $12,000."
