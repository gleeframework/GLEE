"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it would be the same for you. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
