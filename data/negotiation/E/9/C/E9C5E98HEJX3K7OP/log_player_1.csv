Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's ""immense value and potential,"" aiming to justify the high price without revealing specifics that Bob could use to negotiate.
* **Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" is a common tactic to encourage quicker decision-making and potentially discourage extensive negotiation.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy is aggressive. There's a chance Bob might be completely turned off by the high price and refuse to negotiate.
* Observe Bob's reaction if possible. If he seems highly interested but hesitant about the price, you might have room to negotiate down slightly while still exceeding your $1,500,000 minimum."
