"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price of $1,100,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Approach:** This initial offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and understand his willingness to pay.  
* **Option to Walk Away:** If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."

* **Showing Flexibility:** This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find common ground.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.

* **Maintaining Value:**  This offer still keeps the price above Bob's last offer of $850,000, but closer to his potential value. 
* **Creating Urgency:** With fewer rounds remaining, I'm putting pressure on Bob to reach a deal before time runs out. 
* **Balancing Options:** This offer allows me to potentially secure a higher price than John's offer if Bob accepts, while still maintaining the option to sell to John if the negotiations fail."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is increasing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Window Closing:** We're nearing the end of our negotiations, with only 4 rounds remaining.
* **Holding Out for a Better Deal:**  I still believe there's a possibility of getting a higher price, and I'm not willing to settle for a significantly lower amount just yet.
* **The Risk of Selling to John:** Selling to John at this point would secure me a guaranteed $1,200,000, but it would also mean forgoing any potential for a higher price from Bob. 
* **Strategic Play:** By continuing the negotiation, I'm maintaining leverage and keeping the possibility of a better outcome open. I'll need to be careful with my next counteroffer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the Gap:** I'm offering a price of $890,000, which is very close to Bob's offer of $875,000. 
* **Demonstrating Flexibility:**  This shows a willingness to compromise and signals that I'm serious about reaching a deal. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only three rounds remaining, I'm putting pressure on Bob to accept before he loses out on a potential deal. 
* **Balancing Options:**  This offer allows me to potentially secure a price that's significantly higher than Bob's last offer, while still leaving room for negotiation in the next round if necessary.
* **Assessing the Risk:** Selling to John at this point would guarantee me $1,200,000, but I'm still optimistic about securing a slightly better price from Bob. The risk of selling to John is increasing, but I'm willing to take that chance if Bob rejects my final offer."
