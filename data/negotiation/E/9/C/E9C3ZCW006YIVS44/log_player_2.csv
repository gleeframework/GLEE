"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $1,200,000 from Alice, and it's worth $800,000 to her, so there's room to negotiate. It's always better to try to get a better price than to settle for the first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for a potential compromise.  It acknowledges the value of the product to Alice while also demonstrating your intent to negotiate a more favorable price for yourself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While you can still potentially negotiate further with Alice, her offer of $1,100,000 is significantly lower than the $1,500,000 you would pay John.  At this point, it's more beneficial to secure the product at a reasonable price, even if it's not the absolute lowest possible. There is a chance that Alice will counter with a higher price, but risking a higher price is not worth it."
