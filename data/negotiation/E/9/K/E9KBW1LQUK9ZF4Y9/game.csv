"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $10,000 is a bit too low, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $18,000?  This reflects the true value of the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  However, $18,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000?  I feel that's a fair offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this conversation. I see you're serious about this product. Let's bridge the gap - how about $16,000?  This is my final offer, as it's cutting close to my bottom line.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $16,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we possibly settle on $13,000?  I'm hoping we can make a deal!",13000.0,Bob,6,
