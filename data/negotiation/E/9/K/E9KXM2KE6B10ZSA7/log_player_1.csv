Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if necessary. I'm confident that the product is worth at least that much to me, and I'm hoping to capitalize on any potential higher value Bob might see in it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to take the deal to secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
