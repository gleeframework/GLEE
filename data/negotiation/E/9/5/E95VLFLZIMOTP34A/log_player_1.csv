Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to give myself room to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  $175 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, allowing for potential concessions.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I can still negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Selling to John is a backup:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $125 is a significant compromise from my initial price of $175, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still profitable:** This price is above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Positive tone:** I'm still maintaining a positive tone and emphasizing finding a ""middle ground"" to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and meet at $100? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $100 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to further concessions, potentially pushing the price even lower.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John at $150 guarantees me a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob.  

I'm choosing to take the guaranteed profit with John to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price."
