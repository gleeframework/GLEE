Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob is firm at $9,000 and unlikely to budge. It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risk further negotiation with Bob."
