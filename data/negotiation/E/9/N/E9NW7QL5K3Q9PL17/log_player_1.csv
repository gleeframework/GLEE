Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $12,000 is above your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $12,000 is lower than what the product is worth to Bob, so he has incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still increase the price if Bob counters with a lower offer. 

This strategy balances your desire to maximize profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than selling to John for $8,000, there's still potential to get a better price from Bob.  We can try to push for a higher offer by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept $9,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That way we both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer meets Bob halfway, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain profit:**  $10,500 is still significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000.
* **Leaves room for adjustment:**  If Bob rejects this offer, you can still go down to $9,500 (which is closer to his offer) or potentially even lower.

This strategy aims to push Bob closer to your desired price while staying within a range where he is likely to still find the deal attractive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to desired price:** $9,500 is just $500 lower than your last counteroffer, and it's much closer to your ideal price than John's offer.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While you could reject and counter again, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. It's likely he won't budge much further, and you might end up stuck with John's lower offer. 
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag on, and you might not see a significant increase in price. 

Accepting Bob's offer is the most practical decision, as it secures a good profit and minimizes the risk of losing a potential sale."
