Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer sets the price at $1,500,000. This gives Bob a potential gain if he values the product higher than this, while still allowing you to make a profit beyond your minimum of $1,200,000.  

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Higher Potential Profit:** A higher offer increases your potential earnings if Bob accepts. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John will pay $1,200,000 provides a floor to your negotiation. You're not desperate to sell to Bob for less.
* **Encouraging Negotiation:** A starting offer that's not ""too low"" might encourage Bob to counter-offer, leading to a more favorable outcome for both parties.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Value:**  The key is understanding Bob's potential value for the product. If you have any information about Bob's needs or the market, adjust your offer accordingly.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters.  You might accept a lower offer than your initial price, but not below your minimum."
