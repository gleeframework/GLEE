"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire [Product description] for [Price you want to sell the product for]. I believe this product holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. Please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate and potentially reach a good deal.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the value and uniqueness of the product to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly signals that I'm open to discussing the price, setting a positive tone for the negotiation.

**Why this approach?**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Aiming high allows me to maximize my potential earnings.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer will help me gauge Bob's interest and understanding of the product's value.
* **Creating a Framework:** Establishing a high starting point helps set the stage for a negotiation where I control the pace and direction. 

**Remember:** This is just the first step in a multi-round negotiation. I'll adapt my offers based on Bob's responses, keeping in mind my minimum value and the time limit of 10 rounds. I also have the backup option of selling to John if the negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable value, I'm going to reject it for now.  Here's why:

* **Negotiation Leverage:** Rejecting his offer maintains my negotiating power. Accepting his offer right away might signal that I'm desperate and willing to settle for the minimum.
* **Room for Improvement:** I still have 9 rounds left. There's potential to achieve a higher price, especially considering Bob's interest in the product.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By rejecting his offer, I can send a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, potentially leading to a compromise.

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to strategize a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's offer but still within a reasonable range, considering:

* **Bob's Interest:** He expressed interest, which suggests some room for negotiation.
* **My Minimum Value:** I won't go below $1,500,000.
* **Time Remaining:**  I have 9 rounds to reach a deal or potentially sell to John.

By carefully crafting a counteroffer, I can aim to reach a profitable agreement while also maintaining a positive relationship with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I'm confident in the value of [Product description], I'm willing to be flexible. I'm proposing a price of $1,750,000. This reflects the unique benefits and potential of this product, while also being a fair compromise. I'm open to further discussion, let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise & Flexibility:** My counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still reflecting the product's value.

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Approach:**  $1,750,000 is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, creating a plausible negotiation point. 
* **Maintaining Control:** While offering a concession, I still retain a profit margin above my minimum value.

**Next Steps:**

I will closely monitor Bob's response to this counteroffer.  If he rejects it, I'll need to assess his interest level and decide on a further counteroffer.  I'll also consider the time remaining and the potential of selling to John if negotiations become unproductive."

* **Negotiation Power:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially achieve a more favorable outcome.

**Next Steps:**
