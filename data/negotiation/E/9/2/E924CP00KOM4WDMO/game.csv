"I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the price, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000, which is still a premium price for me, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

While I understand your perspective on the value,  I believe my initial offer is closer to the true market value considering the unique benefits this product offers.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
