{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the price, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000, which is still a premium price for me, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

Bob's offer is the same as John's guaranteed offer. I'll counter in hopes of getting closer to  my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective on the value,  I believe my initial offer is closer to the true market value considering the unique benefits this product offers.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While closer, I'm still aiming higher than Bob's current offer. I'll counteroffer again, but I need to be mindful of the shrinking negotiation space and the guaranteed offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. It's clear we both recognize the value of this product.  To move this forward, I'm willing to accept $1,375,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting both the product's worth and our willingness to strike a deal. "", 
""product_price"": 1375000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1,375,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,325,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While not ideal, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his $1,325,000 offer is a reasonable compromise to avoid the risk of him walking away entirely and ending up with John's $1,200,000."
