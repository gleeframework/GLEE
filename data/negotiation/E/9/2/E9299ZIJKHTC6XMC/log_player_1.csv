Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $140 is higher than your minimum value of $120, meaning you'll make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $140 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $150, making the offer appealing to him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Both of us have space to negotiate further,  allowing for a potentially mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is still a profit, it's close to my minimum.  I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  There's still room to find a mutually beneficial price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm proposing $135. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It's still a good profit for me, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
