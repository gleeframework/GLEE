"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm open to offers, but I'm looking for at least $175 for it. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $160, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Can you meet me in the middle?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. $140 is still a bit low for me. Would you be willing to go up to $155? This would be a fair compromise, and we could both be happy with the deal.",155.0,Alice,5,
