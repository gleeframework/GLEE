Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds for you. Please let me know your decision as soon as possible."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's always best to try for a higher profit. Bob's valuation of $800,000 gives us a starting point for negotiation.
* **Strong Opening Offer:** $1,300,000 is a significant markup from Bob's valuation but still leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a ""deal."" 
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By mentioning other potential buyers and a limited-time offer, we aim to incentivize Bob to act quickly. 
* **Justification:**  The message avoids focusing solely on price and hints at the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high cost.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob. If he rejects the offer, we still have the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase at our desired minimum."
