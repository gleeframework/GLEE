"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's within your budget, you can likely get a better price.
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.** You have the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to Alice's minimum.
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** If negotiations with Alice fail, you have a guaranteed way to acquire the product, albeit at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** My counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer. 
* **Reasonable expectation:** This offer is still above Alice's minimum price, giving her room to negotiate but leaving room for potential savings.
* **Strategic move:** This counteroffer sets the tone for a negotiation, showing Alice that I am serious about getting a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to my target.**  While still above my ideal price, it's significantly lower than her initial offer.
* **Further negotiation might be time-consuming.**  I've already made a counteroffer, and there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.
* **Buying from John is still more expensive.** This offer from Alice is a much better deal than buying from John. 

I'm willing to accept this offer to secure the product at a decent price, rather than risk further negotiation or a higher price from John."
