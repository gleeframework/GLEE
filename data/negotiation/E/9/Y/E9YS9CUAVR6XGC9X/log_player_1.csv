Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,500,000 or even more in the right hands. I'm happy to discuss a price that makes sense for both of us. Would you be willing to invest $1,750,000 to acquire this asset?"", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John), you have leverage. Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,750,000) leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your fallback option.
* **Value-Based Language:** The message emphasizes the product's potential value to Bob, potentially exceeding his initial assessment. This framing justifies the high price and encourages Bob to consider its long-term benefits.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""willing to discuss a price"" signals flexibility and invites Bob to counter-offer, initiating a negotiation where you can strategically move towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while acknowledging Bob's potential interest."
