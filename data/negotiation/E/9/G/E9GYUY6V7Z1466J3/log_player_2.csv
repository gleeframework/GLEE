"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to you. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us.  Would you be interested in purchasing it for $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay a maximum of $15,000.
* Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than John's offer of $15,000.
* However, you want to save as much money as possible. 
* You can reject Alice's offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price with her. If that fails, you can still buy from John."
