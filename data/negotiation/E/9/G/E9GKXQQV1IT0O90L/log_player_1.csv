Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000** is a starting point that is above your minimum value but allows room for negotiation.
* The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product while also opening the door for discussion. 

**Important Note:** This is just the initial offer.  You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and your own assessment of the situation. Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffers aren't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $12000? I'm really interested in your product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer meets your minimum, it's still worth trying to get a bit more. You can likely get closer to your desired price by rejecting his offer and counter-offering.  Here's why:

* **You have leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $12,000. This gives you the ability to be more firm in your negotiations with Bob.
* **Potential for higher price:**  Bob clearly wants the product, as he's made an offer.  By rejecting his first counteroffer, you might encourage him to raise his offer or at least meet you in the middle.

**Next Steps:**

You'll want to consider a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's offer but still below your initial asking price.  Something like $13,500 or $14,000 might be reasonable starting points."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,500? This allows me to cover some of my costs while still giving you a great deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering $13,500, which is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. It shows willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for further discussion.
* **Message:**  The message remains friendly and acknowledges Bob's budget concerns.  It also emphasizes the ""great deal"" aspect, highlighting the value to Bob.

**Important Notes:**

* **Keep it reasonable:** This counteroffer is a reasonable step, but you can adjust it based on how confident you are in getting a higher price.
* **Be prepared to negotiate:** It's likely there will be more back-and-forth before reaching a final agreement. Be ready to adjust your counteroffers based on Bob's responses."
