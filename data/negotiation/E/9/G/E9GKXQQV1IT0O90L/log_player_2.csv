# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget. There's no immediate need to accept it.  You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, which could save you money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000? I'm really interested in your product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $12000 is my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13500? This allows me to cover some of my costs while still giving you a great deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial price but still higher than your counteroffer.  It's a good value for you considering your budget and the potential of having to pay John $15,000."
