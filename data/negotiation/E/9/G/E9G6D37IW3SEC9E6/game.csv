"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $10,500? This gives you a significant discount and is still within a reasonable range for me.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
