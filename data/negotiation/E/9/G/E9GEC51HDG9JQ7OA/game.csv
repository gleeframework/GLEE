"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your current offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To move things forward, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This adjustment takes into account the product's unique benefits and long-term potential.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand the value you place on the product, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000, but that's my absolute maximum. I'm confident this offer represents a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but the gap between our positions remains substantial. My final offer is $1,700,000. This considers the significant value the product brings and minimizes further negotiation time. I need a decision on this offer as I have other interested parties.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
