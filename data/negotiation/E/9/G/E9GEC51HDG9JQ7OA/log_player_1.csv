"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming for the highest possible price, significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition,"" hinting at reasons beyond Bob's current understanding that justify the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains positive and collaborative, signaling willingness to negotiate.
* **Alternative in Mind:**  While we haven't revealed John, the high starting price reflects your awareness of a strong alternative buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While he's indicated a willingness to negotiate, his ceiling of $900,000 is still far too low. You have a strong alternative in John, making a quick sale at a low price unnecessary.  It's time to counter and gauge Bob's flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your current offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To move things forward, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This adjustment takes into account the product's unique benefits and long-term potential."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** We're dropping the price by $300,000, signaling flexibility while remaining well above both Bob's offer and your minimum.
* **Reiterating Value:** The message emphasizes the ""true value"" and ""long-term potential,"" subtly reminding Bob of potential aspects he might be overlooking.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help gauge Bob's willingness to move significantly from his initial offer. If he's unwilling to budge much, we might consider leveraging John earlier to avoid lengthy negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand the value you place on the product, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000, but that's my absolute maximum. I'm confident this offer represents a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's increase is minimal, and his ""absolute maximum"" is still significantly below both your $1,500,000 minimum and your previous counteroffer.  It's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to drastically change his valuation.  We need to signal that our offer is firming up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but the gap between our positions remains substantial. My final offer is $1,700,000. This considers the significant value the product brings and minimizes further negotiation time. I need a decision on this offer as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're making it clear this is our last price reduction, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Justified Price:**  We're reiterating the product's value but acknowledging Bob's constraints with a smaller concession.
* **Introducing Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (without explicitly naming John) subtly leverages your alternative to push Bob towards a decision.
* **Time Pressure:** By requiring a decision, we're moving away from extended back-and-forth.

This counteroffer aims to achieve one of two outcomes:

1. **Bob Accepts:** You secure a price significantly above his initial offer and well above your minimum.
2. **Bob Declines:**  His unwillingness to meet your ""final offer"" likely indicates his price ceiling is too low, making it reasonable to move on to John in the next round."
