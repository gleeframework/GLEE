"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation significantly above both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" aiming to justify the high initial price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and invites Bob's feedback, indicating my willingness to negotiate. 
 
Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum price and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While his offer indicates interest, I need to steer the negotiation towards a more reasonable range. I'm confident I can get a better price, even if it means countering and continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price reflects the value I know it can bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Calculated Drop:** I've made a substantial decrease from my initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to engage more seriously. However, the new price is still comfortably above my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message reiterates the product's potential value to Bob's business, subtly anchoring the discussion around its benefits rather than just the price.
* **Positive Tone:** The tone remains collaborative and solutions-oriented, emphasizing my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 

By making a significant counteroffer, I'm aiming to signal my seriousness while still pushing for a price that reflects the product's true worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above both my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his initial offer ($800,000). This indicates a willingness to compromise and recognizes the product's value. 

While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's a risk of alienating Bob and jeopardizing the deal. Accepting his offer now ensures a profitable sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
