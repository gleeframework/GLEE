"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $130, but I'm open to negotiating. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can we meet in the middle at $115?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $122.50? That's still a good deal for both of us.",122.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $122.50 is still a bit steep for me. How about we try $112.50? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $110.",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $112.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $117.50, which is a fair compromise. Let's try to reach an agreement.",117.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $117.50 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about we try $115 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer of $117.50.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to reach an agreement. I'm willing to go down to $116, but that's my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on.",116.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $116 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $115, so how about we try $114.50? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",114.5,Bob,8,
