"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you value greatly, for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
You should accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Savings:** You save $1,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Within Budget:** $14,000 is still within your $15,000 maximum. 

While you could try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price, there's a risk she might refuse, and you'd end up paying more by going with John."
