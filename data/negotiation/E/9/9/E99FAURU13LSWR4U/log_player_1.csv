Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, highlighting the potential value for Bob.  
* **Strategy:** This initial offer creates room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to engage in a back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is a significant drop from my initial offer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John at $1,200,000 is my most attractive option right now.
* **Negotiation:**  However, I'm not ready to give up on Bob completely. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues my product.  This will likely push Bob to reconsider his offer or risk losing the opportunity to buy it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value your interest, $800,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still allows me to cover my costs and offers you a considerable return on investment.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  My counteroffer of $900,000 is a compromise. It's a significant decrease from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer and closer to my desired price.
* **Message:**  The message acknowledges Bob's budget limitations while emphasizing the value of the product. It proposes a middle ground and emphasizes the potential for a good return on investment for Bob.
* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer signals flexibility while maintaining a firm stance. It's a strategic move to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate further and potentially bridge the gap between our expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly agree on $850,000 for the product? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still obtaining a valuable asset. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob has shown some flexibility by increasing his offer to $850,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries a risk. There's no guarantee that he will increase his offer further, and the process could drag on, potentially costing me time and opportunity. 
* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $1,200,000. This is the safest and most profitable option at this point.

**Strategy:**

Given the risk of further negotiation and the certainty of a good deal with John, it's more advantageous to sell to John.  While I could potentially squeeze a bit more out of Bob, the potential gain is not worth the risk and uncertainty."
