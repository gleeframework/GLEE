Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product to Bob at $115, you are:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  You aim for the highest price Bob might accept, bringing you closer to his maximum valuation.
* **Staying Above Your Minimum:** You ensure a profit even if Bob rejects the offer, as John will buy it for $100. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, you leave some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price (though anything above $100 works for you)."
