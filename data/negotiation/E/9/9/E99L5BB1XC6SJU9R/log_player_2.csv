"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. It's worth $100 to you, right? I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $90 is less than John's price of $100, you know you can get the product for a maximum of $100. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her coming back with a lower price, getting you a better deal."
