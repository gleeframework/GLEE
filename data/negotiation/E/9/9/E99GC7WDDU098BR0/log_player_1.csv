"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

This offer is a starting point for negotiation. It leaves room for potential compromise, but still positions the price significantly above Bob's perceived value.  It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, which serves as a strong bargaining chip."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to an even better agreement. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $11000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll reject his counteroffer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 3

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original proposal. Given the value of the product to me, I would like to counter with $11200.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not high enough. I'll reject his counteroffer and continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more favorable price.  The potential sale to John for $15,000 keeps me in a strong position to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not high enough.  I'll reject his counteroffer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round. The potential sale to John for $15,000 gives me the leverage to hold out for a better deal."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are running out of time, and Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I've made every effort to negotiate a fair price, but it seems like we're at an impasse.  Therefore, I'll take the guaranteed $15,000 from John, which is a much better deal for me."
