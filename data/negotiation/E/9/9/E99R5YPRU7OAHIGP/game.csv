"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $820,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you, and I think it's a fair deal. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $820,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
