"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I have 8 rounds left and can still potentially negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $10,500. This is a compromise from my previous offer and still leaves room for further negotiation if necessary.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while still leaving some profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to accept, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I have 6 rounds left and can still potentially negotiate a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $10,000. This is a further compromise, but it's still a price that allows me to make a reasonable profit. We're getting closer to a deal and I want to ensure that I'm not getting stuck in an endless negotiation cycle."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I would prefer to make a deal with Bob, I'm running out of time and his offers aren't getting close enough to my target price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
