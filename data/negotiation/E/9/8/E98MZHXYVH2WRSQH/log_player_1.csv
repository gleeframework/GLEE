Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly more than I'd receive elsewhere. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $1,000,000 is a good starting point because it's still significantly less than Bob's perceived value. This gives him room to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** The message focuses on the win-win nature of the deal and avoids making it seem like a take-it-or-leave-it offer.
* **Alternative buyer:** The message subtly hints at the existence of John as a backup buyer, creating a sense of urgency.

This strategy aims to secure a high price while keeping the negotiation open and leaving room for further bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $900,000?  That's still a significant profit for you, and it's a good deal for me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation space:**  While $900,000 is a significant profit, it's still $100,000 less than my initial offer, and closer to my minimum acceptable price ($800,000). This means there's room to push for a higher price.
* **Counter-offering strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can maintain control of the negotiation and potentially extract a better price.
* **John as backup:** The option to sell to John for $800,000 provides a safety net and strengthens my bargaining position. 

I'll counter with a price closer to $1,000,000, aiming to split the difference and see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is still a very good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial target, but I'm showing flexibility.
* **Positive framing:** The message focuses on the win-win aspect of the deal and the value Bob is getting.

By proposing a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, I'm aiming to push Bob to accept a deal that is still profitable for both parties."
