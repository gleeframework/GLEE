"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly more than I'd receive elsewhere. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $900,000?  That's still a significant profit for you, and it's a good deal for me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is still a very good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is a good price for Bob. It's still significantly less than what he'd pay John, and it leaves room for Alice to make a profit. Accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point."
