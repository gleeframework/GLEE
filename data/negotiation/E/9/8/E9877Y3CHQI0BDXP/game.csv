"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to accept $85?  That's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $95? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my budget.  Would you consider $90?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
