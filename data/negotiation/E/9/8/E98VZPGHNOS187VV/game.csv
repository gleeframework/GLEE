"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession to $1,250,000 to sweeten the deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high. Would you consider $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. Let's try $1,225,000, and I'll throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Those perks are tempting, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we land at $1,175,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's try $1,200,000, and I'll include a comprehensive warranty and support package to give you peace of mind.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
