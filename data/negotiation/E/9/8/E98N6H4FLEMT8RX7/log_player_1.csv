Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me ($120) but still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay ($120). This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to find the product at a lower price. Would you consider selling it for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's likely that I won't get a better offer from him in future rounds. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and successful sale."
