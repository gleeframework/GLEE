"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.**  While it's tempting to take the offer, it's not worth losing $200 just yet. 
* **There are still 8 rounds left.** I have time to negotiate further and try to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Selling to John is a fallback option.** If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can always sell to John for $10,000."

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.**  While it's closer, I'm still not willing to sell for less than my minimum. 
* **There are still 6 rounds left.** I have enough time to keep negotiating and try to get closer to my desired price.
