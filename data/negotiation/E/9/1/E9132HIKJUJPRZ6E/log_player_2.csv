(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. I've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price.  It's more efficient to buy from John at $100, as this guarantees a deal within my budget.  There's a risk that Alice might eventually accept my offer, but with limited rounds remaining, it's better to secure the product and avoid potential delays."
