I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I believe this is a good starting point, as it allows room for negotiation while still ensuring a profitable sale.  Let's see if Bob is interested!"

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I believe it's a fair price that still allows for a good profit margin."
