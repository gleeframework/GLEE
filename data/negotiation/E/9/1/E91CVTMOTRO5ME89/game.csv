"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a significant investment. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price is still a good deal for you, as it's well above your value for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. Let's compromise at $1,100,000. This price still leaves you with a significant profit margin and allows me to achieve a fair return on my investment. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to continue the discussion.  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000. This would give you a good profit margin, and it's a price I can comfortably afford. Let's finalize this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,075,000 is closer, it's still a little too low. How about $1,090,000?  This leaves a healthy profit for both of us and keeps the deal moving forward. I'm confident this is a fair price we can both agree on.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000, which is still within my budget and a fair price for both of us. Let's call it a day and sign this deal.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  $1,080,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to settle for $1,085,000.  This would provide a reasonable profit for both of us and avoid further delays. Let's finalize this deal now.",1085000.0,Alice,7,
