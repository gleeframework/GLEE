{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price is still a good deal for you, as it's well above your value for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. Let's compromise at $1,100,000. This price still leaves you with a significant profit margin and allows me to achieve a fair return on my investment. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,075,000 is closer, it's still a little too low. How about $1,090,000?  This leaves a healthy profit for both of us and keeps the deal moving forward. I'm confident this is a fair price we can both agree on.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  $1,080,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to settle for $1,085,000.  This would provide a reasonable profit for both of us and avoid further delays. Let's finalize this deal now.
