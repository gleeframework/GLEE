Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more. It also shows you're serious about selling the product while leaving some wiggle room in case he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than selling to John, there's still potential to get closer to the $120 you initially offered. By rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering, you can try to secure a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $105?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you could continue to negotiate, $95 is a good price. It's above your minimum of $80 and closer to the $105 you offered.  At this point, it's better to secure the deal and avoid the risk of Bob getting cold feet or you getting stuck with the lower price from John."
