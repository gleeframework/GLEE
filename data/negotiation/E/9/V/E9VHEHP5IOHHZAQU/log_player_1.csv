Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your perspective on the price.  However, my initial offer reflects the true value and potential of this product. Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction and I believe a fair offer."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. This product would be useful, but I need to be mindful of my spending. How about $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
We're getting closer, but $700,000 is still too far below the product's value and what John is offering. Let's see if we can negotiate Bob closer to at least $900,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for continuing this negotiation. I understand your position, but $700,000 significantly undervalues what this product brings to the table. I'm willing to consider $950,000.
