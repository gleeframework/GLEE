"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000."", ""product_price"": 600000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your perspective on the price.  However, my initial offer reflects the true value and potential of this product. Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction and I believe a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. This product would be useful, but I need to be mindful of my spending. How about $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for continuing this negotiation. I understand your position, but $700,000 significantly undervalues what this product brings to the table. I'm willing to consider $950,000. This offer takes into account your budget constraints while still reflecting the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge much more:**  She's gone down, but is clearly anchored around the product's true value to her.  Her concessions are getting smaller.
* **Every round is a risk:** There's no guarantee Alice will ever go below $800,000, even if she's willing to go *slightly* under $950,000.  
* **John is a sure thing:** $800,000 is your walk-away price. It's better to secure that now than potentially end up with nothing after 10 rounds."
