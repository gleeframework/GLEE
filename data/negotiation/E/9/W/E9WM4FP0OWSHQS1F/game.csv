"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,150,000.  What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,150,000. How about $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again between our last offers.  How about $1,112,500? This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm confident this deal will benefit both of us.",1112500.0,Alice,5,
