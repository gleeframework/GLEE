I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offers are getting closer, but they're still not high enough.  It's starting to feel like a long negotiation and I'm worried he's just going to keep lowering the price.  I'm confident I can get a better price in the future with a different buyer, but selling to John now is the safer option."
