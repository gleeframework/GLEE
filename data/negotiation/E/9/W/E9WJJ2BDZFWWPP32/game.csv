"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your willingness to work with me.  $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,150,000?  This allows both of us to gain something from the deal, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
