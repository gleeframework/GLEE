"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is significantly below what I'm comfortable accepting. I'm willing to come down to $1750000, which is still a fair price considering the potential of this product. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm not sure I can go lower than that.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're not willing to go lower than $1750000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1600000. Can we discuss this further?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
