Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90, as it's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but hopefully still enticing enough for him to consider.  We'll see how the negotiation unfolds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum of $80.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm offering $85 as a compromise. It's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  Hopefully, this will be a sweet spot for us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I would like to get closer to my original asking price, Bob seems unwilling to budge much further. At this point, selling to John for $80 guarantees me my minimum and saves time and effort."
