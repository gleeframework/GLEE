"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm. While the product does sound great, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, but I'm not willing to go much lower. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,800. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
