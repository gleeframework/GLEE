"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer and your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",14000.0,Bob,4,
