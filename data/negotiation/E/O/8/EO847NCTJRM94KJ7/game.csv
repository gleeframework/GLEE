"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $800,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While $800,000 wouldn't be ideal for me, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about $925,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think $925,000 is still slightly above my budget. Could we possibly meet somewhere closer to $800,000? I believe this would be a more suitable price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
