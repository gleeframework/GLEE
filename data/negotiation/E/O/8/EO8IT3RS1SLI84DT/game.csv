"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1200000 is a tempting offer, it's simply too low for me to consider.  I understand your perspective, but this product is truly exceptional and holds significant value.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. This gives you a good price while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
