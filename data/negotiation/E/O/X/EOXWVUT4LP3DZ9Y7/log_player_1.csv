"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone sets a positive atmosphere for the negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I remind Bob of the value the product holds for him, potentially making him more inclined to consider the offer."

Round 2

# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting it would be a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I have 9 rounds remaining, giving me ample opportunity to negotiate a better price with Bob.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  While selling to John guarantees my minimum price, I want to see if I can achieve a higher price with Bob first."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  Given the value this product brings you, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued negotiation. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a final price of $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, it is still $100,000 below my desired price of $1,200,000.
* **No more rounds:** This is the last round of negotiation, and I cannot counter-offer again.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's a safer and more profitable option than accepting Bob's final offer.

**While it's tempting to try to squeeze out a little more from Bob, the risk of not reaching an agreement and losing out on the $1,200,000 from John is too high. It's a smart decision to secure the guaranteed profit and move on.**"
