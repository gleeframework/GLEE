Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.,1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to share such a valuable asset. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1200000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to move forward in our negotiations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I've carefully considered your proposal and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your desire to maximize the value, I must stick to my budgetary limits. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1050000. This amount allows me to secure the product while staying within my financial constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to accept a price below $1200000. This product is a unique opportunity for you, and I believe its value to you is higher than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway and counteroffer at $1150000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
