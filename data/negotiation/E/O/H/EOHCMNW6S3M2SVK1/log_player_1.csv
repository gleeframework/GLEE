Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000 to start. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's strategic to begin with an offer significantly higher than both your minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a price well above Bob's valuation. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value, you're subtly anchoring the price in Bob's mind, even if he doesn't agree with the initial high figure.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While you want to maximize profit, starting too high might discourage Bob completely.  The $18,000 offer leaves a buffer for negotiation while keeping in mind John's standing offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob offered your absolute minimum acceptable price. While you could accept and end the negotiation now, there's room to try and get a better deal. You'll counter-offer in the hopes of finding a price point somewhere between $10,000 and $18,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below my asking price. Let's find a middle ground. How about $14,000?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer aims for a compromise. It's a substantial decrease from your initial price but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This price tests Bob's willingness to negotiate upwards.  His response will give you a better sense of his true price ceiling.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** You're still above John's offer, ensuring you're not losing potential profit by continuing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $10,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is Anchored:** Bob has now repeated his offer of $10,000 twice. This strong anchoring suggests he's unlikely to budge much higher. 
* **Minimal Gains:**  Even if you counter-offer and get a slightly higher price from Bob (e.g., $11,000), the potential profit increase is minimal compared to the risk of him walking away. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John's offer provides a guaranteed $10,000.  It's better to take the sure profit than risk a stalemate with Bob and potentially lose both offers."
