"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its benefits, I'm offering it at $14,500. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $14,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $13,000 to make it work for me.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a competitive price, Bob.  While $13,000 is a bit lower than I hoped, I'm willing to be flexible to make this work.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to move forward with the purchase if we can agree on a price of $13,500.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
