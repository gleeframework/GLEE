Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $900,000, which is closer to your desired price range.

Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product for a good price within your budget."
