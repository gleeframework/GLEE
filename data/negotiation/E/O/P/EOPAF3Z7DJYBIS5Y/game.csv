"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $950,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $1,075,000.  This would still represent a significant gain for you, and allows me to move closer to my desired price.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
