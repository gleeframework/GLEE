"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1050000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1050000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm thinking $950000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm thinking $1025000. This is my final offer, but I'm open to discussing other options if you're willing to meet me here.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1025000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm thinking $975000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm thinking $1000000 is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free maintenance package and a 5-year warranty. Is that something you'd be interested in?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras you're offering, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product, but I'd like to discuss the maintenance package and warranty separately. Can we revisit the price and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement?",950000.0,Bob,8,
