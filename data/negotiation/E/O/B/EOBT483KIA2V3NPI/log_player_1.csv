Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob or John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm offering $10,750.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $10,750 and $9,500. How about $10,125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,125

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $10,125 is more than I would get from John and it's a decent profit margin."
