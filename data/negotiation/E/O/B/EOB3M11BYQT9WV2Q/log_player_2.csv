"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $8,750. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $8,750 is below Bob's $10,000 limit.
* **It's a good deal:**  Bob is getting the product for less than what he'd pay John, and it's closer to Alice's desired price point. 
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it:**  The negotiation has already gone back and forth a few times.  There's a risk that further haggling could lead to Alice rejecting future offers, potentially pushing the price back up or forcing Bob to buy from John."
