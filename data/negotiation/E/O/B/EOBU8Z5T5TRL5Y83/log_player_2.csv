**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly very reluctant to go below $11,000. We've been negotiating back and forth, and she's only budging by tiny increments.  At this point, it's unlikely we'll get her down to a price that significantly beats John's $12,000 offer. To avoid the risk of the deal falling through in the last round and wasting more time, it's more strategic to buy from John now."
