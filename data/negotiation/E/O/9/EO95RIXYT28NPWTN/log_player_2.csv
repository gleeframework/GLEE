"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $1,200,000 is still a significant amount above Alice's value. 
* **Negotiation is possible.** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better price. 

By rejecting the offer, you can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a deal closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** My counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still represents a profit for her. 
* **Room for compromise:** By starting at $900,000, I leave room for negotiation in the remaining rounds.
* **Strategic positioning:** If Alice rejects this counteroffer, it signals her willingness to compromise, and I can adjust my counteroffers accordingly in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her first offer, $1,100,000 is still far from my ideal price point. 
* **I'm willing to keep negotiating.** I have several rounds remaining, and there's potential for a better deal.  
* **John's offer is a safety net.** If negotiations with Alice stall or fail, I can still purchase the product from John, although at a higher price. 

By rejecting Alice's offer again, I show her that I'm serious about finding a more favorable price. This can potentially lead to a more aggressive counteroffer from Alice in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:**  This counteroffer is a slight increase from my previous one, showing willingness to compromise while still maintaining a good deal for myself.
* **Testing the waters:** It's important to see if Alice is more willing to move down to $950,000. 
* **Building momentum:** By consistently making counteroffers, I'm showing Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and not willing to simply accept her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **We're getting closer:** Alice's offer is now closer to my desired price point. 
* **More room for negotiation:** While $1,050,000 is a decent deal, I believe there's still room for Alice to come down further. 
* **Maintaining momentum:**  By rejecting this offer, I keep the pressure on Alice to make a more favorable counteroffer. 

Since I have several rounds remaining, I'm not willing to settle for a price that is still significantly higher than my target. I'm confident that with continued negotiation, I can secure a better deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** This counteroffer is only $50,000 away from Alice's offer, suggesting a strong desire to close the deal.
* **Balancing risk:**  While I'd prefer a lower price, it's important to weigh this against the risk of running out of rounds and being forced to buy from John at a much higher price.
* **Negotiation is key:** Alice might be willing to meet me halfway, recognizing that she's getting closer to her desired price. 

If this counteroffer is rejected, I'll need to carefully consider my options for the remaining rounds. I can either continue pushing for a lower price, or accept Alice's offer to avoid the risk of buying from John."
