"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant chunk of the value Bob sees in the product.  This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm confident I can push for a higher price in future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm coming down slightly from my initial offer, but still aiming for a price that reflects the value I know the product holds for Bob.  This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm holding out for a higher offer in the hopes of maximizing my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm continuing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial target.  I believe Bob is motivated to buy the product and will likely meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to push for more, Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is getting close to my target.  It's significantly better than selling to John, and with only 4 rounds remaining, it's a good risk-reward decision.  I'm happy to close the deal at this point."
