"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your position, $900,000 is still below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000. This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I'm trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm also willing to meet you halfway.",920000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and your desire to get the best deal.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $935,000 for the product. This is a good compromise that allows us both to come away feeling satisfied. What do you say?",935000.0,Alice,5,
