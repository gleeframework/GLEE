Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have room to negotiate from a position of strength. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer significantly exceeds Bob's perceived value. While there's a chance he might accept, it's more likely to gauge his interest and begin the negotiation process.
* **Room to Negotiate:**  The high initial price leaves ample room for you to lower the price strategically, potentially still securing a deal well above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer and proceeding with John.  If you want to be absolutely certain to sell the product, a price closer to $1,000,000 would be a safer approach."
