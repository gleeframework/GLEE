"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1200000.0,Alice,3,,
