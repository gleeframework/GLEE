"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a better price closer to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider purchasing it for around $6,000."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a low counteroffer, significantly below our maximum budget. This tactic aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  Seeing how she responds will give us insight into how low she might be willing to go.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  Even if she rejects this offer, we have space to gradually increase our bid throughout further rounds.
 
Our goal is to secure the product for a price significantly lower than John's $8,000 offer, hence the starting point of $6,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has met our bottom line. There's no point in rejecting and trying to negotiate further, as we can buy the product for the same price from John. Accepting now ensures we get the product without risking further negotiation."
