Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message subtly highlights the product's value to justify the higher price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you know the product's worth to Bob, he doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer. This lack of information can work in your favor.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to negotiate. If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can gradually lower the price, but never go below your minimum ($10,000)."
