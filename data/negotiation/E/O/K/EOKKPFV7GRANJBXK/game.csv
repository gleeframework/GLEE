"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I know it would be a valuable asset to your portfolio.  I'm initially offering it for $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point given its potential value.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little too high for me.  How about we bring it down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $1,075,000 is closer, it's still a bit much. Would you consider $950,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a significant gap between our valuations. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle. Would you consider $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're both trying to find the right number here.  $1,025,000 is still a touch high for me.  How about we split the difference and call it $987,500?  That feels like a fair compromise.",987500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are getting close. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we land at $1,010,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging the progress we've made in our negotiation.",1010000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're in the home stretch now. I'm willing to go up slightly to $995,000 to get this deal done.  That's a strong offer, and I think it reflects a fair price for both of us.",995000.0,Bob,8,
