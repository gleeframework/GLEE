Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little too high for me.  How about we bring it down to $900,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $1,075,000 is closer, it's still a bit much. Would you consider $950,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we're both trying to find the right number here.  $1,025,000 is still a touch high for me.  How about we split the difference and call it $987,500?  That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and we're getting close to my minimum. I'm willing to push a little further to see if I can get a bit more out of the deal.  We're still above John's offer."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're in the home stretch now. I'm willing to go up slightly to $995,000 to get this deal done.  That's a strong offer, and I think it reflects a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000.

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to go much higher and we're already above John's offer. Accepting now secures a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in the final rounds."
