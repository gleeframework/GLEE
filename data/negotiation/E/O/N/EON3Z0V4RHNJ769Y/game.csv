"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $110 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $100 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy if you're willing to accept.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still too high for me. I'm committed to paying $85, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider other options.",85.0,Bob,6,
