"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $1,100,000.  He's willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice values the product at $1,000,000. This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob a chance to counter and potentially get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested, but I'm not comfortable with $1,100,000.  I'm happy to offer you $1,050,000 for the product. This still gives you a significant profit, and it's within my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value you place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still a bit high for Bob. He's trying to save as much money as possible and can still potentially get a better price. Rejecting her offer allows Bob to counter again and try to reach a mutually acceptable price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for $1,150,000, but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking that $1,100,000 is still a bit low considering the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value you place on it. I'm offering the product to you for $1,180,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,180,000 is getting closer to Bob's maximum of $1,200,000. While Bob can still try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject his next offer and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer is a good compromise, allowing Bob to save some money while still securing the product."
