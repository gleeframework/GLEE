"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested, but I'm not comfortable with $1,100,000.  I'm happy to offer you $1,050,000 for the product. This still gives you a significant profit, and it's within my budget.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for $1,150,000, but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking that $1,100,000 is still a bit low considering the value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value you place on it. I'm offering the product to you for $1,180,000. What do you think?",1180000.0,Alice,5,
