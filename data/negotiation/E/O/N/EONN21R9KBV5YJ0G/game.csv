"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. Considering my maximum budget of $800000, I would like to propose an offer of $950000 for the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but $950000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1100000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I cannot exceed $800000 for the product. I would like to propose an offer of $900000 as a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob, but I really need to make a profit. I'm willing to make one last offer to you. I can sell it to you for $1050000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to offer $925000 for the product. This amount closely aligns with my maximum budget while still offering you a reasonable profit.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $1050000, Bob. I think you're getting a great deal at that price, and it's the best I can do. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
