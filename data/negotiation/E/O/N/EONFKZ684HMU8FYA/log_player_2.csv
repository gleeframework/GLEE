"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $80 to me, so I am not going to accept Alice's offer of $120. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is a better offer than Alice's first one, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll reject this offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit out of my budget at $105. I'm really hoping to get this product, but $90 is the absolute maximum I can do right now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer you the product for $100. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is closer to my target price, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $100 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $95. This is my absolute final offer.  If it doesn't work for you, I'll need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $95 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you the product for $98. It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $98 is a good offer from Alice, I've already spent several rounds negotiating and I'm getting close to my limit. It's better to take the guaranteed $80 deal from John and move on."
