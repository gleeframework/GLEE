Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium, but I'm also prepared to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's well below my minimum acceptable value.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $14,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable value, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering Bob's initial offer. I hope this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is close to my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  it's better to accept this offer than to risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for $12,000."
