Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could sell to John for $100, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $95 is a good balance:
    * It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), giving you room to negotiate.
    * It's low enough that Bob might find it tempting compared to searching for alternatives. 

**Important Note:**  This assumes you don't know Bob's exact willingness to pay. If you knew he'd pay up to $90, you could adjust your price accordingly."
