Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay slightly less.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $149 is just below your guaranteed price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This gives you the best chance of getting the highest possible price.
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
