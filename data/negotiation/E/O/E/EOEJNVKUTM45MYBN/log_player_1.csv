"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate while also leaving a margin for profit. I'm also framing the offer in a positive light, emphasizing the value proposition for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get more. I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $90 is still a little low for me. I'm offering $95. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95, which is still a bit higher than Bob's offer but closer to my target. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that benefits both of us. I'm also emphasizing fairness and expressing confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $92. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $92 is getting closer to what I want, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'm also considering the fact that I have fewer rounds left and don't want to lose out on a potentially higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  However, $92 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $94.  This is a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit and also ensures you get a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 94}
```

I'm offering $94, which is only $2 more than Bob's last offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also trying to get the best possible deal.  I'm also reminding Bob of the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. After considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $93. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $93.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my target of $100, I'm running out of rounds. I'm also aware that Bob is getting closer to my minimum price of $120.  Accepting his offer ensures I get a decent price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
