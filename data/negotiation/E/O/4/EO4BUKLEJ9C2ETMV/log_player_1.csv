Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant return on investment you'll see."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. My proposed price for the product is $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is good, I'm confident I can still negotiate a better price. It's still early in the negotiation, and selling to John for $800,000 is my fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still lower than I'm aiming for.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice's position, but I would like to propose a price closer to my initial budget. How about $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is moving closer to my price, and $925,000 is a solid profit.  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns and risks losing the deal entirely."
