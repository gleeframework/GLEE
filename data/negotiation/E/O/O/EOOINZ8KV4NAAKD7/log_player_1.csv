Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering the product, Alice. I'm interested, but my budget is limited to $120. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob.  Even though $120 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $120 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $130 to make this deal work.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering my budget, would you be willing to lower the price to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to keep negotiating, Bob's offer is only $5 less than my minimum.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer and having to settle with John for $120."
