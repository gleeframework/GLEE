Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need at least $15,000 to make this worthwhile, so I'm starting above that.
* **Potential for more:**  I don't know Bob's value for the product, so I'm aiming high to see if I can get a better deal.
* **John as a safety net:**  If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, so I'm not taking a huge risk. 

This approach balances the desire for a higher profit with the security of a known fallback option."
