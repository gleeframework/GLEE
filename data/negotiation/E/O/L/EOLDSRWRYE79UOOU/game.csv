"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1150000.  This price still leaves some room for profit for me, while giving you a great deal for a product that's worth $1500000 to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I see in it.,1050000.0,Bob,4,
