Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum desired value for the product.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still some wiggle room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It shows you're serious about selling to him:** By making a concrete offer, you're demonstrating your willingness to negotiate with Bob, increasing the likelihood of a successful deal. 

Keep in mind that this is just the first offer. Be prepared to negotiate further based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above what John is willing to pay, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and what you believe the product is worth.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap.  You'll likely need to concede some ground, but you can still aim for a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This price still leaves some room for profit for me, while giving you a great deal for a product that's worth $1,500,000 to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

Here's why this counteroffer is strategic:

* **Compromise:** It shows you're willing to compromise by coming down from your initial offer.
* **Reasonable price:** $1,150,000 is still higher than Bob's offer and closer to your desired value.
* **Appeals to Bob's interest:** You remind him of the product's value to him, emphasizing the potential for a good deal.

By taking this approach, you're increasing your chances of closing the deal while still protecting your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to John's offer of $1,000,000.  At this point, continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing the deal entirely.  There's a high chance that Bob will continue to push for a lower price, and you might end up with a deal that's not worth the time and effort.

Selling to John guarantees a sale at your minimum acceptable price, which is better than risking further negotiations with Bob that could lead to a lower price or no deal at all."
