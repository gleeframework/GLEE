At this point, it's better to buy from John.  You've made several counteroffers, and Alice has shown a willingness to come down in price, but she's still not at your target price of $80.  You've also used up several rounds of negotiation, and the deal could continue for a long time.  It's better to cut your losses and buy from John, saving yourself time and money."
