"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, at $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters, but still reflects the value I place on the product. I'm confident I can get at least $8,000 from John if this negotiation falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$5,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but not that much. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm offering $8,500, which is still above my minimum price point of $8,000. I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, showing I'm willing to negotiate but also maintaining my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $6,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

I'm dropping my price to $7,500, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. This is still a good deal for me, but I'm getting closer to a potential agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $6,500 is tempting, I'm sticking to my strategy of negotiating higher. I have a few rounds left, and John is always a safe option if this negotiation doesn't work out. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm dropping my price again to $7,000, signaling my willingness to compromise. I'm approaching a point where I may need to consider John's offer, but I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob before that becomes necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm running out of rounds, but I believe I can still convince Bob to go higher. If the next round doesn't yield a better offer, I will consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 6800}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm dropping my price to $6,800, which is very close to Bob's last offer. It's a risky move, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in finalizing the deal. If he rejects this, I'll have no choice but to sell to John in the final round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached the final round, and Bob's offer of $6,300 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting nothing. It's better to secure the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
