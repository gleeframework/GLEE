Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to find a more budget-friendly option, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,225,000. I believe this is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

This is a good time to accept the offer.  Alice is signaling this is her final concession, and the price of $1,225,000 is a reasonable compromise.  Continuing to negotiate risks alienating Alice or missing out on a good deal."
