Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $1050000. This price is still well above your value for the product, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1075000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. We're getting close to the end of the negotiations, and while I could continue with Bob, it's becoming increasingly clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and a safe bet given the time constraints."
