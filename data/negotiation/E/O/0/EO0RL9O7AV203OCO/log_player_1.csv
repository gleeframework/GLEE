Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my guaranteed minimum:** This gives me the potential to earn more than my fallback price with John.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer, and I can then decide if his offer is acceptable.

If Bob rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000."
