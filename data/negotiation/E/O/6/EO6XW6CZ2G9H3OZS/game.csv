"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for me, but $950,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. Let me know what you think!",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $825,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about we settle at $750,000? I'm eager to make a deal and move forward.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think!",800000.0,Alice,5,
