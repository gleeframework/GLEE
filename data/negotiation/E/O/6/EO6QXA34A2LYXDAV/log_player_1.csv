"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer.  $700,000 is too low for me.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 just isn't feasible for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  It's a fair price for both of us and lets us move forward."", ""product_price"": 775000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand where you're coming from.  To be honest, $775,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we try $740,000? That would work much better for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $740,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $740,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $740,000 is still too far below my desired price. I'll try to get closer to my goal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise.  To be completely transparent, I have a hard limit at $750,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal right now.

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $750,000 is getting closer to my target, I still believe I can get a slightly higher price. I'm not ready to give up yet.  I'll counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
