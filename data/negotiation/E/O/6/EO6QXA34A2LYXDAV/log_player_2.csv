Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try $755,000. That's a small step closer to my desired price, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this.

``` 

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Price is right:**  $755,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and a reasonable compromise. 
* **Time is ticking:** We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and pushing Alice further could backfire.
* **John is the fallback:** Remember, we can always buy from John at $800,000 if this deal falls through, but it's better to secure the deal now at a lower price."
