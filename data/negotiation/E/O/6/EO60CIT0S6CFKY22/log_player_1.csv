"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we start the negotiations at a more reasonable price, say $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  I will reject it and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3

While I am starting to get close to Bob's offer, it is still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I will reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

I've decided to sell the product to John for $800,000.  While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get a better price from Bob, this is the best option at this point.  I'm still getting my minimum threshold and I don't want to risk losing the deal with John by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
