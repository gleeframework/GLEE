"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's valued at $800,000, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we start the negotiations at a more reasonable price, say $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $600,000 is significantly lower than the product's value, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $700,000. This gives us both a fair deal.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about $650,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $650,000 just isn't feasible for me.  How about we split the difference again and go with $675,000? It's a fair price that allows us to both walk away happy.",675000.0,Alice,5,
