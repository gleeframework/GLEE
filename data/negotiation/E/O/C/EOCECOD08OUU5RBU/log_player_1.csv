Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so he won't pay more than that.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. This means a deal is impossible unless one of you changes your valuation or a creative solution is found. 

**The Offer**

Since a standard negotiation won't work, you need to either:

1. **Convince Bob to increase his valuation:**  This is difficult without more information about the product and why Bob might value it more. 

2. **Find a compromise:** This is unlikely, but you could explore options like:
    * **Payment plan:** Could Bob pay more over time, making the initial price more palatable?
    * **Additional benefits:**  Can you offer something extra that increases the product's value to Bob?

**Given the lack of ZOPA, the most logical approach is to go straight to John.**

**Offer to Bob (Not recommended):**

While a deal is unlikely, you could try:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  I believe its value far exceeds the asking price of $1,400,000. Are you interested in discussing this further?"", ""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Price:**  Starting high leaves room for negotiation if Bob is unexpectedly interested.
* **Exclusive Opportunity:** Creates a sense of scarcity and potential value.

**Important:** This offer is unlikely to succeed. Bob has no logical reason to pay more than $1,200,000. You are much better off going directly to John."
