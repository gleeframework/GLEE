{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth $1,000,000 to you. This is a great price considering the value it can bring to your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to $850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the worth of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $900,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still not comfortable with $900,000.  It's closer, but I need to get closer to my minimum acceptable value.  I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000, but this is my final offer.  This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $910,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $910,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I've already made significant concessions.  We're running out of rounds, and I'm concerned we won't reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and avoids further negotiation."
