{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to lower my price to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, there is still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a little too high.  I'm willing to offer $10,750. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down to $10,900.  This is my final offer.  Let's make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is only $400 more than Bob's counteroffer of $10,500. It's a good deal for Bob considering his maximum budget of $12,000 and the fact that this is Alice's final offer. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a favorable price without risking a higher price from John."
