"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you, and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of reach. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in this product. However, I still believe it's worth more than $1,100,000.

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,125,000 is still a bit high. I'm ready to close the deal at $1,075,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's finalize this.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
