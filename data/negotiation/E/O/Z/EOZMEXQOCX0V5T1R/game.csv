"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $109. What do you think?",109.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $109 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable going.  Would you consider $107?  I'm really interested in the product, and this is the most I can afford right now.",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $107 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to sell it for less than $108. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $108. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",108.0,Alice,5,
