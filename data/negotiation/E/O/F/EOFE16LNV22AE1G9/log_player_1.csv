Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe you'll find it to be a great deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:**  You have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product at $140, you are:

* **Maximizing Profit:** You are aiming for a price close to Bob's maximum valuation to maximize your potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's a chance Bob might try to negotiate a lower price, but the $140 starting point gives you some leeway. 
* **Staying Above Your Minimum:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, you are still likely to get a price higher than John's $100 offer."
