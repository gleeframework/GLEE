# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above what the product is worth to you. You have a significant amount of room for negotiation and can likely get a better price.  There's no reason to accept her offer right away."

Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.
