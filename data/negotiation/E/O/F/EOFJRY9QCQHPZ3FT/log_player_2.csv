"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Let's negotiate to see if we can get a better price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to find a middle ground. It acknowledges Alice's offer wasn't outrageous while still aiming for a price closer to my ideal range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is getting closer, it's still above my ideal spending limit. I'll try one more time to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,750?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 10750
}
``` 

This counter-offer shows I'm willing to compromise but still holds firm to getting a good deal.  If Alice rejects this, I'll likely go with John's offer unless she makes a significant move."
