"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is a better price than $150, there's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject. You're willing to go up to $150, so it's worth seeing if you can get a better deal."
