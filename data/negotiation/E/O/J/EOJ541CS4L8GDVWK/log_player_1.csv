{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It sets the initial price at your minimum acceptable value, and leaves room for negotiation.  I'm optimistic that Bob might be willing to pay more than $80, especially since he is potentially interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $115. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $150.  I'm going to counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going below $120.  This is a good quality product, and I'm sure you'll find it worth the investment. Let's finalize this deal at $120 and avoid further back and forth."", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point about the product's quality, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, it's getting time-consuming and I'm confident I can get my desired price from John. It's better to secure a guaranteed sale with John at $150."
