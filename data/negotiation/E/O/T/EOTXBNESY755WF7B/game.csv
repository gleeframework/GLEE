"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of significant value to you. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be worth at least $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000.  This is a one-time offer, and if you decide to pass, I have another buyer lined up who is eager to purchase it. Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
