{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $115 is within my budget of $150 and is a reasonable compromise.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's likely she won't budge much more. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure the product while staying within my budget."
