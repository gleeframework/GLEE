"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $8500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000. That's still a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly. Let's make it happen!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I hear you, but I'm still not quite there yet at $8800.  Let's split the difference and close this deal at $8900.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move on to the next step.  What do you say?",8900.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your budget, but I'm still not quite at $8700.  How about we meet in the middle at $8800?  It's a good price for both of us, and we can finally wrap this up.  What do you say?",8800.0,Alice,7,
