Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because:

* It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, giving me room to negotiate.
* It's lower than Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000, making it likely he'll consider the offer.

By starting with a higher offer, I can potentially secure a more favorable deal. I'm also leaving room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a decent price, it's still lower than my desired outcome. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $950,000.  This is a compromise:

* It's higher than Bob's offer of $900,000, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* It's still lower than my initial offer of $1,000,000, demonstrating flexibility.
* It's closer to my desired price point, and still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still lower than what I'm hoping to get. I'm going to reject his offer and try one more time to negotiate a higher price. If this doesn't work, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is my final counteroffer. It's a compromise:

* It's higher than Bob's offer of $850,000, but still lower than my previous offer of $950,000.
* It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John to guarantee a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $825,000 is only slightly higher than John's offer of $800,000. Given the potential for further negotiation with Bob to be lengthy and uncertain, it's more beneficial to secure the guaranteed sale with John."
