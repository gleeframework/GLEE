"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still above your maximum. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a better price.  You can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  A counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still leaves some room for compromise. 
* **Negotiation tactic:** This shows Alice you're serious about buying, but you're also willing to walk away if the price isn't right. This puts pressure on her to negotiate. 
* **Your budget:** This offer is still within your budget, leaving you some wiggle room if Alice counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a little closer to your desired price, but $1,250,000 is still too high.  It's worth continuing to negotiate, especially since you have a guaranteed alternative with John.  By rejecting this offer, you can try to push Alice further down, or at least maintain your current position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incrementally closer:**  This counteroffer increases your previous bid by $50,000, showing you're willing to compromise while still pushing for a lower price. 
* **Testing the waters:**  This gives Alice another chance to negotiate. If she accepts, you get a good deal. If she rejects, you can then evaluate whether to try a final counteroffer or go with John.
* **Maintaining leverage:** This offer is still significantly below Alice's value and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to your maximum, but it's still too high.  At this point, you've negotiated for a few rounds, and it's unclear if you'll be able to get Alice to come down any further.  You have a guaranteed alternative with John at $1,000,000, which is a better deal than Alice's current offer. It's time to stop the negotiation and secure the product at a lower price from John."
