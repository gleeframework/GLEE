# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our flagship product which has the potential to significantly impact your business operations. Given its high value to you, we believe it's worth $1,500,000. Our first offer to you is $1,200,000. We're confident this is a fair deal that respects both the value of the product and your budget. Let's discuss how we can move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:  

* Alice's offer is $1,200,000. This is above your desired price range.
* You can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. 
* Buying from John is a last resort, so it's best to see if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice first."
