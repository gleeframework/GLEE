"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $20000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It's worth exploring if a lower price is possible through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a low counteroffer, half of Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it establishes Bob's budget and sets the stage for negotiation. It's important to remember that Bob has a fallback option with John, so he can afford to be more aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $10000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17500.  This is a fair price considering the product's unique value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $17,500 is still above Bob's budget of $12,000, but it shows she is willing to negotiate. Bob should try to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $17,500 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer by a significant amount, demonstrating his genuine interest in the product while staying within his budget. The message emphasizes that this is a serious offer, putting pressure on Alice to consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  $13000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $16000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, her offer of $16,000 is still above Bob's budget.  Bob has already shown he's willing to go higher than $13,000, but it's worth exploring if he can secure a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you coming down, but $16,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $14,500.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, demonstrating his commitment to the negotiation while remaining within his budget. By calling this his ""final offer,"" Bob is putting pressure on Alice to accept and avoid risking losing the deal.  It also creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Alice to make a decision."
