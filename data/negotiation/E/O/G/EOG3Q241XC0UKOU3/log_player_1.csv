Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to haggle you down. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" Alice subtly implies that the product is worth the higher asking price.
* **Alternative Option:**  By mentioning she'll list it publicly, she subtly puts a time pressure on Bob, encouraging him to act fast if he wants the product.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, there's a chance Bob might reject the offer outright. Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters or seems hesitant."
