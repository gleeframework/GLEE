"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this counteroffer?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,050,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,025,000? This is my final offer, and I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
