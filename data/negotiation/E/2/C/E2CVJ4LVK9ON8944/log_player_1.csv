Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, there's room to negotiate above my minimum price ($1,000,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still ensuring a significant profit for me.
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects this offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000. This knowledge gives me leverage in the negotiation. 

By setting the initial price high but reasonable, I increase the chances of securing a deal that benefits both parties."
