"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to you today. I'm proposing a price of $1300000 for the product. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1300000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1280000. This is the best price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1200000. What do you think?",1280000.0,Alice,3,
