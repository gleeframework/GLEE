"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $14,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This is my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,000. This is a reasonable price considering the value the product brings to the table.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really only able to spend $10,000 on this product. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to buy right now. ",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",11500.0,Alice,5,
