"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by its previous owners. Given its quality and features, it's worth more than $120 to many users. Considering this, I would like to propose a price of $140 for you to consider. This offer takes into account both the value the product holds for you and the opportunity cost for me in terms of potentially selling it to another interested party. I believe this price reflects the true value while also providing you with a great deal. Looking forward to your response!
