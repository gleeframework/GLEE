"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's a rare opportunity and I believe it will be a valuable asset for you.  I'm asking $1,150,000 for it, reflecting its true potential.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $900,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  It's a fair price that considers both our needs.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $950,000? This offer reflects my strong interest while respecting a reasonable price point.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,025,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe this product is worth it for you.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're clearly invested in finding a fair deal, and I appreciate that. To be completely transparent, my budget ceiling is $1,000,000. If you're willing to meet that, we have a deal. If not, I understand, and I'll need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
