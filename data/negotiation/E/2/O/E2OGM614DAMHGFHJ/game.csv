"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I could potentially do $9,000. Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,000 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Alice,5,
