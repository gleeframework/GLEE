"I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $6000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7500 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9000? This would give us both a fair outcome.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $9000 is still a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,6,
