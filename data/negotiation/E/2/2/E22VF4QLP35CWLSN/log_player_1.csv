Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $16,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 16000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will reveal how much he values the product and how flexible he might be on price. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John provides a safety net. This allows you to be more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just the opening move. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters your initial offer."
