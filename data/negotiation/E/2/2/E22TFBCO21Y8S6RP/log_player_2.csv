Alice's offer:

Alice is clearly committed to a slow negotiation tactic, and while we could likely push her down a little further, the potential savings are unlikely to be substantial. Accepting at $1,125,000 secures a decent discount from her initial offer and avoids the risk of the negotiation dragging on further."
