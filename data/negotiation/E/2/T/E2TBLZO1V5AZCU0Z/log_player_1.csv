Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,400,000 is better than his initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, so I'll see if I can get him to come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still gives you a good deal.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,500,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price, so I'll accept it and sell the product to him.  I've successfully achieved my goal of getting at least $1,500,000 for the product."
