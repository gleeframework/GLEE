"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still gives you a good deal.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,500,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from there.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
