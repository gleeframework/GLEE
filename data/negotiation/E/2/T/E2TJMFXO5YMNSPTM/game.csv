"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe you'll find it's worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value of the product,  $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,300,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering the value and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,250,000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value and your budget.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work, I'm going to purchase the product from John.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,250,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a dedicated support package, which will provide you with additional value beyond the product's price. I'm still offering the product to you for $1,250,000, and I believe it's a fair price considering the extras I'm including.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
