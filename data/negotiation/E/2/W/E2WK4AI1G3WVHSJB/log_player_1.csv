I'm not going to accept Bob's offer this early in the negotiation. He's still quite a bit lower than my ideal price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."

Bob's offer is getting closer to my target price, and I'm confident I can't get much more from him. It's time to lock in the deal and avoid risking losing him completely."
