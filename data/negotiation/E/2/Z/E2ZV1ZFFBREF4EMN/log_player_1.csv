Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value, hoping to maximize my potential profit.  I'll be ready to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

$1,000,000 is far too low for me. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still holding out for a value that's closer to my minimum. I think $1,750,000 is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm going to counteroffer again and try to get closer to my desired value."

I'm making one last attempt to find a compromise with Bob.  I'm coming down to $1,600,000, which is still a significant profit for me.  If he rejects this offer, I'll take John's offer and move on."
