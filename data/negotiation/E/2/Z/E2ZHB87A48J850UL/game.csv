"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need it to be more affordable. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 was a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $900,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
