Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob is willing to negotiate. It's significantly higher than his perceived value ($1,000,000) but offers him a substantial discount from your guaranteed selling price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message suggests you're open to discussing the price further, allowing Bob to potentially counter-offer and potentially reach a deal somewhere between $1,400,000 and $1,500,000."
