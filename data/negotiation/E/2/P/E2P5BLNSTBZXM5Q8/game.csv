"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves room for a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you can't go as low as I initially proposed. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  That's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still unable to go as low as $950,000.  How about we meet at $1,050,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's finalize this.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
