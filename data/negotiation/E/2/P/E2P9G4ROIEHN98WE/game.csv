"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $9,500? That's a fair price, considering the value of this product.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $9,000, but I really think $9,500 is too high. Can you meet me at $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
