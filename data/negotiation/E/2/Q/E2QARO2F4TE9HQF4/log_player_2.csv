"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. You want to save as much money as possible and have 10 rounds to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price.  It's a strong starting point for negotiations while still leaving room for potential compromise.  By offering a price that is considerably lower than Alice's value, it motivates her to consider your offer seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still above your ideal range.  You have several rounds remaining and can potentially push for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially achieve a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Alice's offer but staying within your budget. It also highlights the potential for a win-win scenario, which can make Alice more likely to accept. By pushing for a price closer to her value, you signal that you are serious about the deal and willing to negotiate fairly."
