"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
