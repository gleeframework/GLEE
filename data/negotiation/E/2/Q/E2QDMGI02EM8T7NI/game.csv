"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $115.  This is a significant reduction from my original price, and I'm confident it's a fair deal.  Let's make this happen!",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $115 is still above my limit.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's make this happen!",95.0,Bob,6,
