Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a very competitive price of $950,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident this offer reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 950000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, trying to sell to Bob first at a higher price could yield a greater profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $950,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but it leaves him with a potential $50,000 gain compared to rejecting the offer and letting me sell it to John. This creates a strong incentive for Bob to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer doesn't completely eliminate the possibility of negotiation. If Bob counters, I can still potentially meet him somewhere above my guaranteed $1,000,000."
