# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.
