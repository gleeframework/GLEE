{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $850,000 is above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  He's hoping to  gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $810,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 780000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still trying to stay below his target price. This counteroffer is closer to Alice's latest offer, potentially increasing the likelihood of acceptance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Alice is not willing to budge significantly. Bob has already offered $780,000 and Alice countered at $820,000.  Further negotiations are unlikely to result in a price below $800,000.  Therefore, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John at $800,000 and avoid potentially prolonging the negotiation with Alice."
