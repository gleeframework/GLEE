"I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $14,000 for the product.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me partway. However,  $14,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we settle at $17,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $17,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $15,500, as I mentioned earlier, but I can also do $15,800 if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",15800.0,Bob,4,
