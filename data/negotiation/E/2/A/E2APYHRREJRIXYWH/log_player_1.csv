"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point because it's a significant discount for Bob compared to his perceived value, but still leaves me with a profit above my minimum of $80.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. There are still 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair price that is still profitable for me. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in accepting this offer, as it's only $5 less than his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $87 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $90. We've only had four rounds, and I believe there is still room for negotiation. I'm going to stick with my strategy of making counteroffers to see if I can get Bob to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 89}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer slightly to $89. This is a small compromise to show Bob that I am willing to negotiate, but it's still a profitable price for me.  I'm hoping that this will be enough to convince Bob to accept the offer, as we're getting closer to the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to continue negotiating, we're getting close to the end of the rounds.  $88 is a good profit and is only $2 less than my last offer. I'll accept Bob's offer to ensure I don't lose out on the potential sale to John."
