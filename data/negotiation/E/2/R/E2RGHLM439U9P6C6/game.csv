"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is at least $1500000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you place on this product, $1800000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1000000 at this time.  Let me know if that's a price we can work with.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $1000000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid that's still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1400000. This is a compromise that I hope we can both agree on. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1200000. This feels like a fair price for both of us, considering your initial asking price and my budget.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1200000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not ready to let go of the product at that price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, trying to find a middle ground. I'll offer you $1300000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
