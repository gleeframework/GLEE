"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is at least $1500000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's not worth buying from Alice at this price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $1000000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid that's still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1400000. This is a compromise that I hope we can both agree on. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,400,000 is still above your budget.  Since John is offering the same product for $1,000,000, it's more advantageous to reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating with her or move forward with buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This feels like a fair price for both of us, considering your initial asking price and my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1200000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not ready to let go of the product at that price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, trying to find a middle ground. I'll offer you $1300000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, her final offer of $1,300,000 is still above your budget. You have a reliable alternative with John who is selling the same product for $1,000,000.  It's more financially beneficial to buy from John at this point."
