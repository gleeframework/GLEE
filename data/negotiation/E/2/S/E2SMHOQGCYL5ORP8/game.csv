"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay up to $8,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm prepared to offer $9,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",9500.0,Alice,5,
