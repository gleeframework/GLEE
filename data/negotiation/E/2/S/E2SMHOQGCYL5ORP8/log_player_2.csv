"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $12,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is well above his budget, and he has a cheaper option with John.  It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice before going with John."

{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay up to $8,500.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum of $8,000.  He can still get the product from John for a lower price. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice again, but if she doesn't budge, he'll go with John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm prepared to offer $9,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice's final offer of $9,500 is still above his budget.  He has a guaranteed way to buy the product for a lower price, so it's the best choice at this point."
