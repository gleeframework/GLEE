# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident that this product will bring you significant value exceeding that amount. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?
