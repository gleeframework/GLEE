"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $11,000. This still represents a significant discount compared to the value you see in the product, while also providing a reasonable profit for us. Please let me know if this revised proposal meets your expectations.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $10,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's make it happen.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to finding a mutually beneficial solution. Based on your offer, I propose a price of $10,900 for the product.
