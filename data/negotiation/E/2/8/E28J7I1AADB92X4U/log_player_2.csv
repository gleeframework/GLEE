"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $10000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good price, Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate. It's likely Bob can get a better price, especially since he has the option to buy from John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a good starting point.  I'm interested, but I'd need to see it at $8,000 to make it work for me."", ""product_price"": 8000}
