Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $80 gives you leverage. You don't *need* to go below that price."
