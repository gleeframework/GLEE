"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's in excellent condition and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is within Bob's budget, it's still a bit higher than Alice's valuation of the product.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested but I'm hoping to get it for a bit closer to my budget. How about $10,500? "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's valuation while still keeping some room for negotiation.  He's offering $10,500, which is $1,000 lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her valuation. This should be a reasonable counteroffer that could lead to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go as low as $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, offering $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering Alice's valuation and Bob's budget.  Accepting the offer means Bob gets the product for a price he's comfortable with, saving him $1,000 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting the offer or the negotiation dragging on for too long outweighs the potential savings."
