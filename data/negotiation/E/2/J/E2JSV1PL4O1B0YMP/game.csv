"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not willing to pay $20,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and features.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This offer represents a substantial compromise on my end.",17000.0,Alice,3,
