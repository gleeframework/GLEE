{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price that's closer to Bob's value of $120, while still ensuring I get a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I'm hoping to get more. I'll counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to do $88?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, and I'm not sure I can get much more.  It's better to take the $88 than risk losing the deal altogether."
