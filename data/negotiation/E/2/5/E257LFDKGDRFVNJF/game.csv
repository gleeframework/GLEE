,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $100? This would still be a good deal for you, considering the product's worth to you.",100.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $95?,95.0,Bob,4,

I'm still not convinced about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $92?,92.0,Bob,6,
