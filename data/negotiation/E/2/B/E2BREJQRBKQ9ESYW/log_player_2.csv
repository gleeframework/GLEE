"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for $9,500. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's lower than John's price, it's still above what the product is worth to Bob.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  
* **No immediate risk:** Rejecting Alice's offer doesn't obligate Bob to buy from her. He can still walk away and buy from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500. This product is worth $10,000 to me, so $8,500 is a fair compromise that benefits us both. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is cutting it a bit too close for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This product is truly worth it, and I want to make sure we both feel good about the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is a compromise from her previous offer and is closer to Bob's desired price. 
* **Value for Bob:** This price is still below Bob's maximum budget of $10,000 and provides a good value compared to buying from John.
* **Time and Effort:**  Accepting the offer avoids further negotiation rounds, potentially saving time and effort."
