Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $130, which I think is a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer of $100 from John. 

**Strategy:**

The goal is to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering the product at $130 gives Bob a $20 discount, making it a good deal for him. At the same time, you secure a $30 profit, which is a significant improvement over John's $100 offer."
