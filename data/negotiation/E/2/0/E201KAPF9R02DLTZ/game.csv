"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a great deal to both of us. I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000, which reflects its value and allows for room for negotiation. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I believe the product is worth more than that. Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This price reflects the value we both see in the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can find a better middle ground. How about $1,200,000? This price is still a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
