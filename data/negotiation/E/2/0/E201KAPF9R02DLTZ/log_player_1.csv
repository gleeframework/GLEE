Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I believe the product is worth more than that.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can find a better middle ground. How about $1,200,000? This price is still a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is a fair price, and it's better than selling to John for the same amount."
