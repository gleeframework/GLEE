"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000.  I think that's a fair offer considering its value.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $800,000 for the product. This is still a good price for you considering its value, and it ensures I can make a reasonable profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,3,
