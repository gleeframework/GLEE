Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,300,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. He should continue to negotiate and try to get the price closer to his target of $1,000,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've considered your offer, and I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. I believe this is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise while still reflecting the true value of the product.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's ideal target.  John's offer is the best deal available, and Bob shouldn't risk further negotiation with Alice, especially since she's stated her offer is final."
