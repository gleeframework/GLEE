{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's also of significant value to you. To kick things off, I'm offering it to you for $900,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save as much money as possible. I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we discuss a price closer to your budget? I propose $850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can achieve a better price.  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm prepared to come down a bit further, but I'm firm on a price of $875,000.  This reflects the significant value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. I'm still working within my budget constraints. I would like to suggest a price of $860,000 for the product. This offers a compromise between our positions and keeps the deal within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to squeeze out a bit more. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if we can reach a compromise that benefits us both."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but $860,000 just doesn't quite cover the value of this product for me. I'm willing to be flexible, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $865,000. This price ensures a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 865000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. After careful consideration, I'd like to suggest a price of $855,000 for the product. This offers a reasonable compromise and stays within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $855,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $855,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I would prefer a higher price, we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  Accepting Bob's offer at $855,000 is a reasonable outcome, as it's significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000 and it's a good compromise with Bob.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing the sale altogether."
