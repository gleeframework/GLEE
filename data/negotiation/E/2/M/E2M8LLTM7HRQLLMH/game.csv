"Thank you for considering my offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save as much money as possible. I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we discuss a price closer to your budget? I propose $850,000 for the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm prepared to come down a bit further, but I'm firm on a price of $875,000.  This reflects the significant value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but $860,000 just doesn't quite cover the value of this product for me. I'm willing to be flexible, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $865,000. This price ensures a fair deal for both of us.",865000.0,Alice,5,
