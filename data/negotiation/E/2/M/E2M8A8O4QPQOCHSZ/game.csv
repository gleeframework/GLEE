"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I've priced at $12,500, knowing its worth to you. This is a fair price that allows me to make a good profit while also giving you a significant benefit.  If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details.  Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $10,000.",12500.0,Alice,1,
