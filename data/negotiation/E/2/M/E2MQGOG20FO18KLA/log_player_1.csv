Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

Since I need to earn at least $150 for the product, and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay that amount, there's no reason to offer a lower price to Bob.  By offering $150, I maximize my potential earnings and still have a fallback option if Bob rejects the offer."
