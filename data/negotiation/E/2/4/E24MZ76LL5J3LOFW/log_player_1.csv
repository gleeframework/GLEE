Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $950,000.  I know its value to you, and I believe this price reflects its significance. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming high initially allows room for negotiation while staying below Bob's perceived value. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup guarantees at least $800,000, making a lower offer to Bob riskier.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys the product's value and suggests the price is firm but open to discussion."
