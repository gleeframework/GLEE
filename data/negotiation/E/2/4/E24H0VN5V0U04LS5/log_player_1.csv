Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.  
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value without explicitly revealing your bottom line. 
* **Room for negotiation:** A significantly higher price leaves space for potential negotiation while still aiming for a substantial profit beyond your minimum.
* **Alternative buyer safety net:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell to John at your desired minimum price."
