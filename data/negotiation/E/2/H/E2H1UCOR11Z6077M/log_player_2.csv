{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is $50,000 above Bob's maximum budget. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 780000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a bold counteroffer, aiming to secure a significant discount.  While $780,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, it's a substantial reduction from Alice's initial offer. This counteroffer signals Bob's seriousness about buying the product while also establishing a lower price point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $820,000 is still above Bob's ideal price. While it's a lower price than her initial offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can aim for a lower price and see if Alice is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 790000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increases his offer slightly from the previous round, showing that he's willing to compromise while still staying within his budget. This offer is closer to Alice's last offer, indicating that Bob is serious about closing the deal.  It also leaves some room for negotiation in case Alice wants to counter with a slightly lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $810,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still a $10,000 difference.  Bob can try to negotiate a lower price, as it's still within the acceptable range for him.  He can still buy the product from John if he doesn't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final attempt to get the price down to his ideal $800,000.  Since Alice has consistently lowered her price, Bob is showing his commitment to buying the product by matching her offer. If Alice rejects, Bob will likely buy the product from John to avoid further negotiation and ensure he gets the product within his budget."
