"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a little steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, Alice. How about we settle at $97? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $97 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I can offer you the product for $102. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. What do you think?",102.0,Alice,5,
