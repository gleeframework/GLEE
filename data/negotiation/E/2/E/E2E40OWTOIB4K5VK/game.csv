"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $900000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850000. This reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's keep the conversation going.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850000 is closer, I'm still a bit higher than my target. I'm happy to offer $800000. This is a fair price that considers the value you've described, and allows us to both walk away feeling satisfied. Let's see if we can seal the deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
