"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is quite a bit higher than what I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $6,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I could consider $18,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While $18,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $10,000?  That would be a great price for me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're definitely closer.  I can see you're serious about this product. To meet you halfway, I could let it go for $15,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant discount already. ",15000.0,Alice,5,
