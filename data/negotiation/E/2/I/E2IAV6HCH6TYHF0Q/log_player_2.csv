"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $10,000. Alice's offer of $9,500 is better than John's offer of $10,000, but you can still do better. By rejecting her offer, you force her to lower her price to be competitive."
