Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,000,000 is still above what I can afford right now.  I'm committed to making this deal happen, but I need to stay within my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $900,000?  This feels like a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand that you're committed to making this deal happen, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll counter with $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
