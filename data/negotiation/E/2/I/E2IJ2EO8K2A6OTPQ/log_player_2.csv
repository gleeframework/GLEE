{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,037,500. This is only $12,500 more than my last counteroffer. Given that there are only 5 rounds left, it's likely I won't be able to get a much better price. Accepting her offer saves me $87,500 compared to buying from John."
