"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. It's a truly unique opportunity to own something of immense value. I'm willing to part with it for $1800000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum, as I have another seller willing to sell it to me at that price. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to me. Let me know if you're interested.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my genuine interest in acquiring this product. Let me know if you're open to this.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your bid. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to me. Let me know if you're interested.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
