"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit too high for me. I would be willing to pay $900,000 for it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference from our previous offers and settle on $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
