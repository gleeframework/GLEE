"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is below her product valuation, you know you can get the product for a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  There's no point in negotiating with Alice when you have a better option readily available."
