,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10500. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11250? This would give us both a good deal.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $11250 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $10750.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my budget. Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10750 is still significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,
