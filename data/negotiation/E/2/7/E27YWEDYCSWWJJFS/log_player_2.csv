"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is less than Alice's value of $15,000, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11250? This would give us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While it's closer to his ideal price, Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  There are still several rounds left, and he might be able to get a better deal if he's patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $11,250 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $10,750.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10750 is still significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  While they've gotten closer to an agreement, Bob is running out of rounds and the risk of not reaching a deal is increasing. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000 to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
