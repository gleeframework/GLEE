Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below Bob's perceived value of $15,000 but still significantly higher than my minimum of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation while also maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my initial offer, but it is still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject this counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my initial price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000.  This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $15,000. It also gives me some wiggle room for further negotiation while still allowing me to achieve a better price than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's counteroffer is still a bit lower than I'd like, it's only $200 below my previous offer. It's also very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,500. There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, and I risk losing the deal entirely if I keep rejecting offers.  It's best to accept this offer and move on."
