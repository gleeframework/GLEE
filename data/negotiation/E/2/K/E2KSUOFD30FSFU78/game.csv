"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000? I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and am willing to be flexible. Let's settle this right now. How about $975,000?  This is my final offer.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $960,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",960000.0,Bob,6,
