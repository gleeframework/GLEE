"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000. I'm confident that you'll find it a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to accept or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

You can definitely do better than $1,200,000. Let's see if we can negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the value of the product to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1,175,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice is still asking for a price that's higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price again."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,100,000, Bob. However, I'm still not sure if that's the best price for me. Considering the value of the product to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. My revised offer is $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. If this is still not acceptable, I may need to consider other options.

While $1,150,000 is tempting, it's still a bit more than I want to pay. I'm going to go ahead and buy the product from John for $1,000,000. This is the best price I can get right now."
