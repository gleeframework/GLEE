"While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is a fair price that works for both of us, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to go up to $9,500. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go much lower than $12,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, so I'll meet you at $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
