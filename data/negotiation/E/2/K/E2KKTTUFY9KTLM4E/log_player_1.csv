Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm asking for $1,700,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  You know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at that price to John. This puts you in a strong negotiating position.
* **First Offer Anchor:**  By starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,700,000), you create an anchor point for the negotiation. Even if he doesn't accept this price, it sets the stage for a potentially more profitable deal than your fallback option. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing your absolute bottom line, leaving room for Bob to potentially accept the high price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes Bob is somewhat negotiable and potentially willing to pay a premium. If you have reason to believe Bob is extremely price-sensitive, you might adjust your approach. 
* **Risk Tolerance:**  There's always a chance Bob will reject your offer outright. However, the potential for a higher profit might outweigh this risk, given your fallback option."
