"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $15,000 for it.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that I'm prepared to buy it today. What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $16,500. It's still a great deal considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm prepared to buy it right now, but my maximum budget is $15,000. Let's see if we can close this deal.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $16,000. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
