"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. He's willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $16,500. It's still a great deal considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still higher than his maximum budget. He should try to negotiate further and see if he can get closer to his desired price before considering buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $16,000. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's final offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. It's clear that Alice isn't willing to go any lower, and further negotiation is unlikely to be successful.  John is offering the product at Bob's desired price, so it's the best option available."
