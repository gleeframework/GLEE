"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum price but leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is still a good price for me, but it's closer to Bob's offer, which might encourage him to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better price in the next round.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired $1,200,000."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000.  We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower, and I'm not confident we'll reach a deal that's worth my time.  John's offer is a guaranteed sale and a fair price, so I'm going to take it."
