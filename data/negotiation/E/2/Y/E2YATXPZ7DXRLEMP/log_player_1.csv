Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Message:**  I'm using a positive message to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Room for Compromise:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he has to accept my initial price. 

If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John for a guaranteed $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  While I could accept his offer and get something, there's a chance I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $120, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer. 

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to reach a mutually agreeable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95. This would still give me a fair profit, and it's a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Positive and Encouraging:** The message is positive and encourages Bob to consider my counteroffer. It emphasizes the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Room for Adjustment:** Leaving some room for negotiation (e.g., $95 instead of $100) allows for a possible compromise in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $120, making it risky to accept Bob's offer.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  There's still a chance I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

I'll counteroffer Bob again, trying to find a middle ground that's closer to my minimum while still appealing to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $90. This is a great price considering the value, and it's a good compromise for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my previous offer of $95 and Bob's latest offer of $85.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate and reach a middle ground.
* **Positive and Encouraging:**  The message remains positive and encouraging, emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Final Offer:**  I'm making this offer as a final compromise, signaling my desire to close the deal. If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely accept John's offer, as Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still hesitant to go below $90."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $87.50 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it's still not there.
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $120, which is significantly higher than Bob's current offer.
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob would require more time and effort, and there's no guarantee that we'll reach a mutually agreeable price.

Considering the factors above, it's more advantageous for me to sell the product to John for a guaranteed $120. This allows me to maximize my profit and avoid further negotiation."
