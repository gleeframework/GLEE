"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept an offer higher than that.  He should try to negotiate with Alice to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm looking for a price closer to $8,000. Would you be open to discussing $8,500? I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial offer, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  He should continue to negotiate with Alice to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping for something closer to my budget. Would you consider $8,750? This price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm offering the product to you for $9,200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice has stated that $9,200 is her final offer, and Bob has already made several counteroffers. At this point, it's clear that Alice is unlikely to go lower. Since John is offering the product for $8,000, it's in Bob's best interest to take that deal and avoid further negotiation."
