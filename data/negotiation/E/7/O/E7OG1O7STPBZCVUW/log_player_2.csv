"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's worth $100 to you, but I'm willing to let it go for $95. Don't miss out on this great opportunity! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a price closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $95 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer starts significantly lower than Alice's asking price. While it might seem aggressive, it anchors the negotiation lower and leaves room for us to meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product, fostering a positive negotiation environment. 
* **Strategic:** By offering $70, we aim to gauge Alice's willingness to move significantly from her initial price. This information will be valuable in subsequent rounds."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $77?"",
 ""product_price"": 77
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:** We acknowledge Alice's price reduction while proposing a compromise.
* **Targeting the Midpoint:**  Offering $77 positions us directly between Alice's current offer ($85) and our previous counteroffer ($70).
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer tests Alice's flexibility. If she accepts, we get a good deal. If she rejects it, we'll know we need to adjust our approach in the next round."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. Considering your offer, I am willing to sell the product for $82. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  $82 is a solid price for the product, well below our maximum budget and a significant saving compared to John's offer.
* **Final Offer:** Alice has signaled that this is her best price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Alice sticking to her price or even walking away from the deal. Accepting now secures a favorable outcome."
