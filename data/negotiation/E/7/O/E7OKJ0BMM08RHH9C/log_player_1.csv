"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than $10,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a significant drop from my initial offer and reflects my desire to reach an agreement. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer.  $13,000 is a good price, especially considering the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially ending up with the lower price from John."
