"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high quality and unique features, it's valued at $150 by me. Considering its worth to you might be around $100, I'm willing to negotiate a deal that benefits both of us. Would you be interested in discussing a price that falls within this range? Let's aim for a fair compromise that reflects the value you see in the product while ensuring a reasonable profit for me. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer ($125):** While Alice is willing to negotiate, her starting offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. 
* **John's Offer ($100):** This meets your budget perfectly. 

**Strategy:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that her price is too high. She might be motivated to lower it closer to your range, especially knowing you have another option. However, even if she doesn't budge, you're securing the best price with John."
