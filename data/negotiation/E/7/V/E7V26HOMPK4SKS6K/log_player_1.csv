"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product. Its value is undeniable, and I believe it will be transformative for you. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has value, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 to start the negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  We have time to negotiate and selling to John for $1,000,000 is a good fallback option if we can't get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $500,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a very competitive price for something this valuable."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but the gap is still pretty wide for me.  To move things along, I could do $650,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob is moving in the right direction, $650,000 is still too low. We are getting closer to John's offer, but we have room to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and so am I.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle on $975,000? That feels like a win-win to me."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000 to show I'm serious.  That's a big jump from my last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We are now getting close to John's offer, but it appears Bob is willing to go higher.  It's worth one more counter-offer to try to get closer to our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we are getting close!  Your willingness to move up is encouraging.  To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to accept $862,500. It's a strong offer, reflecting the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 862500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're in the home stretch now. I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  It's a really strong offer and I'm hoping we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're so close to John's offer now. It's worth pushing Bob one more time to see if we can close the gap.  We can always fall back to John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're absolutely right, we're almost there! I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle this right now at $830,000? That's my final offer."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is it - last chance!  I'm willing to offer $815,000.  It's the best I can do.  Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob is very unlikely to meet our desired price.  It's time to cut negotiations and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
