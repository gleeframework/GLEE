"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room to negotiate.  I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price. I believe I can get closer to my target of $1,700,000 with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still holding firm on a significant profit.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a good compromise and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call. I'm still hoping for more, but Bob is inching closer to my minimum price.  I'm not sure I can push him any higher without risking him walking away, and I'm already losing time with each round.  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale above my minimum, and I can always try to negotiate a better deal with John in the future."
