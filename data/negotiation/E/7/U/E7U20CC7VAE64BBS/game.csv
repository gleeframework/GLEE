"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a good compromise. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to settle on $95 just yet. I'm willing to go a bit lower than $110, but I need to make a bit more than $95. How about we try $105?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $100, which is my limit.  If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",100.0,Bob,6,
