Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good deal, he can likely do better. He has information about Alice's valuation, and there's room for negotiation."

# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save even more, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already saved $150,000 from his initial valuation, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price. It's a good compromise and a solid deal."
