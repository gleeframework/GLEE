"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm proposing a price of $1300000 for the product.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1300000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1100000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1200000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this incredible product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
