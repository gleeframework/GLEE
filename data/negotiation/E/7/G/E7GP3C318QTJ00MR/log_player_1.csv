Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $18,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification for price:** While the message acknowledges the value to Bob, it also subtly implies the price is justified, potentially influencing his perception.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The phrasing ""What do you think?"" leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, initiating a negotiation where you can potentially still get a price higher than $10,000.

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob might reject this offer outright. However, given your safety net (John), it's strategically better to aim high initially. If Bob rejects, you can always offer a lower price or move on to John."
