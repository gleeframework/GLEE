Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget for this product. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which reflects its value to me while also being a fair price for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being within my budget.

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing at a slower rate than my decreases. It's unlikely he'll reach a price close enough to my minimum in a reasonable timeframe. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is a sure thing and saves me further negotiation."
