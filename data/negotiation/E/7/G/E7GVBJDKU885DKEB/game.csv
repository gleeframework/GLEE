"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget for this product. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which reflects its value to me while also being a fair price for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $2,000,000 represents the high end of its value,  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects the true worth and potential of this product. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
