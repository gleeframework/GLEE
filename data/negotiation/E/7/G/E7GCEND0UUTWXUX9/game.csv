"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $800,000?  This would be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,3,
