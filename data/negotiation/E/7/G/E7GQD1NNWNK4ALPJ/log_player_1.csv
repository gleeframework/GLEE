"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $130, which is a great price considering its worth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a little below Bob's estimated value, hoping to find a middle ground quickly. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is my minimum, I'm not going to settle for that right away.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $115?  This gives you a good price, and allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $107? That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, I'm close to my minimum acceptable price, and there's a chance Bob might walk away if I keep rejecting.  It's better to secure the deal at $107 than risk losing him completely."
