"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $130, which is a great price considering its worth.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly above her value ($100). There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  Starting with a lower offer ($100) aims to anchor the negotiation closer to Alice's value. This might make her more willing to settle for a lower price overall. 
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Alice rejects this initial counteroffer, it provides space to negotiate upwards while staying well below John's $150 backup option.
* **Gauges Alice's Flexibility:** Alice's response to this counteroffer will give insights into how flexible she's willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $115?  This gives you a good price, and allows me to cover my costs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice lowering her price to $115 is a good sign, showing she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Room for Improvement:** However, $115 is still significantly above her value, and there are more rounds for negotiation. A counteroffer might bring the price closer to a more desirable level.
* **John as a Backup:**  Remember, you have the option of buying from John for $150 if the negotiation stalls or Alice remains unreasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $107? That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?"",
""product_price"": 107
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer proposes a price directly in the middle of the previous two offers ($100 and $115). This tactic often feels fair to both parties and can help move negotiations along.
* **Testing the Waters:**  By offering $107, we're testing Alice's willingness to go below the $110 mark. Her reaction will give us valuable information about her bottom line.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** We're still in a good position with plenty of rounds left. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation active and avoids stalling the process."
