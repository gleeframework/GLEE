Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher than Bob's value:** $12,000 is more than the product is worth to Bob ($8,000), giving him some incentive to buy.
* **Lower than my floor:** $12,000 is less than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000), meaning I still make a profit.
* **Negotiation room:**  This offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers. 

By offering a price in the middle ground, I'm maximizing the chance of a deal with Bob while still ensuring a satisfactory outcome if he declines."
