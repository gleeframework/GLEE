Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $500,000 

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation is ideal. However, being too greedy could make Bob reject the offer.  

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message emphasizes the product's value and Bob's privileged position.
* **High but Justifiable Price:**  $1,400,000 leaves Bob with a $100,000 gain, incentivizing him to buy while giving you a significant profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if it's just John) adds a time pressure element, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach. You could adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance."
