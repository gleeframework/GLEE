Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond the $10,000 you estimate. However, I do have other interested buyers, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage to start the negotiation higher with Bob.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value exceeding Bob's estimate, potentially justifying the higher price.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price higher than your minimum. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable potentially losing Bob as a buyer if he finds the initial offer too high."
