Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $120. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and this is a fair price considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down a bit, while still ensuring I make a significant profit.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum perceived value makes the deal seem more attractive and less like I'm trying to take advantage.
* **Backup Option:** I have John as a backup buyer who will pay $80, ensuring I don't lose money if Bob rejects the offer."
