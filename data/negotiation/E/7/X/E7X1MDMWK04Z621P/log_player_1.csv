Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation isn't helpful:**  I only get to interact with Bob once.  If he rejects my price, I can't revise it or try to haggle. I have to go straight to John. 
* **Aim high, but be realistic:** Since I have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John, I need to aim higher with Bob. Starting at $170 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer, but still gets me a good profit if he accepts outright."
