"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is unfortunately a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a good price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product and would like to buy it, but my budget is firm at $8,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,500, as it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'll offer it to you for $9,500. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to try to reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,5,
