Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it allows for some negotiation room. 

Here's the logic behind this offer:

* **Potential for Higher Profit:** I'm aiming to maximize my profit. Offering a higher price gives me a chance to earn more than my minimum acceptable amount.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Since I know John is willing to pay $1,200,000, I'm not taking a huge risk by offering a higher price to Bob. If he rejects, I have a guaranteed sale with John.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  Offering a price higher than my minimum value allows for negotiation. If Bob is seriously interested, he might be willing to counter-offer closer to my desired price. 

This strategy balances my desire for a higher profit with the need to secure a sale."
