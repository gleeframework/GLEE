"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is closer to my goal, I'm still not satisfied. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the previous round. This demonstrates flexibility while still staying within my desired price range. I believe this offer is still attractive enough for Bob, considering his initial offer of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  The risk is that Bob will get frustrated and walk away, but I'm hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I believe this is a fair compromise.  This offer is still above Bob's last offer of $1,100,000, but it's also closer to my goal of $1,500,000. I'm hoping that Bob sees this as a reasonable compromise and accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my desired $1,500,000,  I'm concerned that Bob might not budge further.  It's getting risky to keep negotiating, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.  John is a guaranteed sale at my target price, so it's the safest and most lucrative option at this point."
