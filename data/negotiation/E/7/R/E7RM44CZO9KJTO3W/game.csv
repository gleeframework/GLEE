"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I'm personally very attached to, but I'm ready to let it go for the right price. I'm confident it would be worth at least $1,500,000 to you, as it is to me.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,550,000.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have other interested parties waiting in the wings.",1550000.0,Alice,1,
