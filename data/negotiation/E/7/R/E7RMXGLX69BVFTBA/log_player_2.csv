You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $16,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $15,500. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $15,500 and it's not worth the risk of her refusing to negotiate further. Buying from John guarantees the best price."
