"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $1,400,000 to make this work.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  It's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,325,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's meet halfway between our last offers - $1,337,500.  This would be a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us to close the deal.",1337500.0,Alice,5,
