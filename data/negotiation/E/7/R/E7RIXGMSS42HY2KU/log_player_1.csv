I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. While $1,700,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $1,700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,800,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm starting to run out of time. I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, I might not be able to get a higher offer from Bob. It's better to secure the $1,500,000 from John now."
