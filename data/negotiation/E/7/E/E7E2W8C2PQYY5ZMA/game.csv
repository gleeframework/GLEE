"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $7,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $7,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  I think that's a fair compromise, and it allows me to get closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,800? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",7800.0,Bob,4,
