"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1200000 is my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference at $1350000? This allows me to make a reasonable profit, and hopefully, it's a figure you can work with.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a compromise at $1250000. This is the maximum I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
