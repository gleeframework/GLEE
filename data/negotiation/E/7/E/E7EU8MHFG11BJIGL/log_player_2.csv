{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

While $120 is less than the $150 John is asking, it's still a bit more than the product is worth to you ($150). You can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."

Round 2

{""product_price"": 105}

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $105, which is halfway between Alice's offer of $120 and my target price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and hopefully, Alice will be willing to accept it."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

**Explanation:**

Alice has increased her offer, so I will increase my counteroffer as well.  $110 is still below what I'm willing to pay, but it shows I'm willing to compromise.  This should hopefully encourage Alice to meet me halfway."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice continues to be stubborn, but I'm still confident we can reach a deal. I'm increasing my offer to $115, which is halfway between her offer of $130 and my previous offer of $110.  This shows that I'm willing to compromise and hopefully encourages Alice to do the same."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offers keep increasing, and we're running out of time. The offer of $135 is getting too close to John's price of $150, and I'm not confident I can negotiate Alice down further.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
