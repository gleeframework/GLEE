Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm willing to sell the product for $9,800. It's the lowest I can go without losing money. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and at $9,800 the price is acceptable compared to John's $10,000 offer. It's better to secure a small saving now than risk losing out in further negotiation."
