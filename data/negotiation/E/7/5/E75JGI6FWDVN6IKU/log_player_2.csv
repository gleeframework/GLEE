"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. $120 is still a bit high for you, as you're willing to pay up to $150. It's best to start negotiating and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to get a significant price reduction. You're aiming for a price that's closer to Alice's value of $80, but you're still leaving some room for negotiation. This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $110, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still a bit too high, but it's getting closer to your budget.  You're still hoping to negotiate a lower price, so it's worth rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $110 is still a bit outside my range.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to find a middle ground that's closer to your desired price but still shows that you're willing to compromise. By offering $105, you're splitting the difference between your last offer and Alice's current offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $108. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is getting very close to your desired price range. While you could continue to negotiate, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and the chance of buying from John at a higher price increases.  At this point, accepting her offer is the most sensible option to secure the product at a price you're comfortable with, given the limited rounds."
