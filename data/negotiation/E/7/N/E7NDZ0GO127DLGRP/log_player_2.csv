"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price gives you a good deal while ensuring I get a fair return. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","Here's how to reason about this:

* **Your maximum price:** $15,000
* **Alice's offer:** $12,000
* **John's price:** $15,000

Alice's offer is less than both your maximum price and what John is offering. You save money by accepting.
