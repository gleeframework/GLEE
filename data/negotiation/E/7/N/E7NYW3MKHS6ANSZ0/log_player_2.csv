"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is close to his maximum, it's still above his target price.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potential for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit above my budget.  How about $115?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $125? It's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's maximum, it's still $5 more than what he's willing to pay.  Bob has time and should continue to negotiate for a better price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and potentially leads to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $125 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
