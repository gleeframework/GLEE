"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $750000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  It's a great starting point, but unfortunately, I can't go above $700000 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider that?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to reduce the price to $725000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $725000 is closer, I'm still a bit outside my budget.  Could we settle on $710000? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to close this deal.",710000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $715000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, so I hope we can come to an agreement at this point. What do you think?",715000.0,Alice,5,
