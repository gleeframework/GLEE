"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $20000. It's a steal! What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20000 is way out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $10000.  What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17000.  That's a significant reduction from my initial offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $17000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really keen on this product, and I'm willing to go up to $12000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14000 for the product.  This is the best I can do.  Let me know if you're interested.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $14000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm prepared to pay $13000 for the product.  It's a good price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $13500.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a little more than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $13000.  It's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,8,
