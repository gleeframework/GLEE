"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:**  I'm framing the high price with language highlighting the product's ""unique value"" and ""potential."" This emphasizes its worth and justifies the initial ask.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I want to maximize my profit, I also want to avoid dragging out negotiations to the point where I miss out on John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is moving in the right direction, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to signal that his initial offer isn't in the ballpark.  I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While I recognize your perspective on the value, my initial assessment of the product's worth and potential remains firm. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to consider $2,100,000."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've reduced my price significantly from the initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, the new price is still above my minimum acceptable price and closer to my starting point, reflecting the product's value to me.
* **Firm but Fair:** I'm using language that acknowledges Bob's position but reiterates the product's value justification for the higher price. This keeps the negotiation moving without conceding too much ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,600,000. I think that's a fair price for the product's value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to push him a bit further, but I'm also aware that I'm only $100,000 away from John's guaranteed offer. I need to carefully consider my next move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,950,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price by a significant amount ($150,000) to show Bob I'm serious about closing the deal. This concession is substantial but still keeps the price well above my minimum and John's offer.
* **Justification:**  I'm framing the price reduction as a strategic decision based on finding a mutually beneficial outcome, not desperation. 
* **Time Pressure:** With fewer rounds remaining, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to make a decision while keeping my options open with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm really hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  While I could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price, the remaining rounds are limited. Accepting now secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away. 
* **John as a Backstop:** Accepting Bob's offer eliminates the need to rely on John's offer as a backup, ensuring a successful sale. 

While I could push for more, accepting a strong offer now outweighs the potential risks of continuing the negotiation."
