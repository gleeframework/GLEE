"I'm getting close to my limit, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $860000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm starting to get a little frustrated with the back-and-forth. If we can't meet at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $1200000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.",860000.0,Bob,10,
