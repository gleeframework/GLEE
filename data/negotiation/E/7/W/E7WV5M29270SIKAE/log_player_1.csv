"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a high starting price, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It's also higher than John's offer, giving Bob a clear incentive to negotiate. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how willing he is to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and even lower than what I could get from John. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,200,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's a good compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate.  It's also more than what John is offering, so it still incentivizes Bob to close a deal with me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what John is offering. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a smaller decrease from my previous offer, showing that I'm becoming less flexible.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob, and this offer should encourage him to make a more reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still slightly below what I could get from John. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push Bob to a higher price. I have a few more rounds to negotiate, so I'm not going to settle for just slightly above John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is a significant decrease from my last offer, showing that I'm getting closer to accepting a deal. It's still more than John's offer, and I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to finally accept.  With only a few rounds left, I need to start narrowing the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob,  I'm starting to run out of time.  With only two rounds left, it seems unlikely Bob will come up to my price.  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is more than what Bob has offered so far."
