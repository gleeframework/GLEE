"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, I am looking for a more reasonable price. Would you consider selling it for $500000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a more reasonable price, Bob, but I'm afraid $500000 is still a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits the product can bring to your business.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $800000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're working with a tight budget, Bob, but $800000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1000000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value and benefits.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
