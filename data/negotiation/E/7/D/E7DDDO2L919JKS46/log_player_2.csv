# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Explanation:**

Since Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget, there's no room for negotiation. Buying from John at the same price provides certainty and avoids the risk of a prolonged negotiation that might result in a higher final price or a potential stalemate."
