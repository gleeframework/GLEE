Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation.  It's important to be ambitious, especially since I know the product's worth at least $800,000 to me.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using positive language to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the product's value to make Bob more likely to accept a higher price.
* **Flexibility:** This offer sets the stage for a negotiation, and I'm prepared to adjust my price based on Bob's counteroffers. However, if Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can always walk away and sell to John for $800,000."
