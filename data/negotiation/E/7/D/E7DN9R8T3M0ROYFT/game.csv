"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. That's the highest I'm willing to pay. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to accept $1,350,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the significant value it holds for you.  Let's close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,280,000 is simply not a fair price for this product.  I'm willing to go down to $1,320,000.  This is a significant reduction from my last offer, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1320000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,320,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,290,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1290000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,290,000 isn't quite where I need to be. However, I'm willing to make one final concession to reach a deal. I'm prepared to accept $1,300,000 for the product. This price recognizes both your need for a good deal and the value this product holds for you. Let's close this now and avoid further delays.",1300000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid I've reached my limit, Alice. I can only go up to $1,290,000, and I've already offered that price in a previous round. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't meet on price. I'll have to consider purchasing the product from John for $1,500,000 if we can't come to an agreement.",1290000.0,Bob,10,
