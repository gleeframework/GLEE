Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **""Value"" Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's value justifies the high asking price.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning listing it ""publicly"" implies that if Bob waits, he might miss out, subtly encouraging a quicker decision. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  If Bob rejects it, Alice can always negotiate down, knowing she has John as a backup buyer."
