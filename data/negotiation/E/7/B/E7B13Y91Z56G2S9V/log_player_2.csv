"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the market value is $1,500,000 to you. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John at $1,500,000. There's room to negotiate with Alice to try and get a price closer to her value of $1,200,000."
