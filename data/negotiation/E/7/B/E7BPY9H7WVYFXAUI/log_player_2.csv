You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $10,500. This is a significant reduction from Alice's offer of $11,500, but still above Alice's minimum value of $10,000. This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation while still being a good deal for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $11,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $12,000 and significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. Accepting this offer saves Bob money and secures the product.  While there's always the possibility of a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the product to another buyer or facing further negotiation is not worth the potential savings."
