I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This price is higher than my minimum value of $10,000, but leaves some room for negotiation, as the product is worth $12,000 to Bob. This initial offer gives me a good starting point to potentially maximize my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer and still a decent profit for me, while also leaving room for a potential final agreement with Bob."
