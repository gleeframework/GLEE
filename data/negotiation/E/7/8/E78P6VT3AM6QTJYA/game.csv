"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've put a lot of effort into, and I know it could be very beneficial for your company. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from what it's truly worth.  This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, I'll be moving forward with another buyer. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
