"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not yet willing to settle.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price and still close the deal with Bob.  There are still 8 rounds to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still maintaining a significant margin. This shows Bob I'm serious about negotiating with him, while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out hope for a better price.  It's risky, but with 6 rounds left, I think I can push for a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm making a significant counteroffer, dropping the price considerably. This is a gamble, as it's closer to Bob's valuation, but I'm hoping this shows him my willingness to compromise and encourages him to meet me halfway. With only 5 rounds left, the pressure is on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is too high. His offers are getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not confident we can reach a price that is closer to my desired value.  It's time to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
