"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider this price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $9,500 for the product.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at that price?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,500, which would be $9,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
