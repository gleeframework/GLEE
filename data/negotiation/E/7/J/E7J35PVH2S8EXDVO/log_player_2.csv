"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you'll get it at a price significantly lower than its true value to you, and I'll get a price higher than what I'd get elsewhere. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is lower than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. You know you have John as a backup option at $12,000.  By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you might prompt her to propose a lower price, getting you a better deal."
