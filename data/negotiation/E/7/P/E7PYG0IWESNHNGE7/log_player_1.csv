"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is an aggressive opening offer, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. I'm hoping to get a good price for my product, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't offer a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $750,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum value. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $900,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, but it still ensures I get a good price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $850,000 is a good price, and I'm happy to close the deal.  It's above my minimum value and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
