"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $20,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to sell it to you at a discount.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $8,000.  If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to go with John's offer.",8000.0,Bob,4,
