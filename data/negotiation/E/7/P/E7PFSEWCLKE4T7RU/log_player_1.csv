Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit.  We'll see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still push for a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but my product is truly unique and worth every penny. I'm willing to come down slightly to $8,500. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate your product, but I would like to stick to my maximum price of $8,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has stuck to his $8,000 offer. While I could try to counteroffer again, I'm worried that we'll be stuck in a stalemate. John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm going to sell the product to him and avoid any further negotiation."
