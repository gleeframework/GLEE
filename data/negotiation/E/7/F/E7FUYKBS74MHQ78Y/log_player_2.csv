"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a lower price than $900,000, and there's no reason to accept the offer on the first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as low a price as possible. Since he knows Alice's bottom line is $1,000,000, he's offering $800,000 as a starting point. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still within Bob's budget and leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer.  Accepting this offer means Bob saves $50,000 compared to his last offer and $350,000 compared to buying from John. It's a good deal, and while there's always the possibility of getting a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal entirely is increasing with each round."
