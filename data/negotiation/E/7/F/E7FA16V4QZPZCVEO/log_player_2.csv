"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's unique and I believe it has great potential for you. I'm offering it to you for $10000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since your maximum budget is $10,000 and Alice's initial offer is $10,000, there's no immediate benefit to accepting.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by proposing a lower price.  It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about buying but also wanting a good deal. The message is friendly but firm, aiming to establish a foundation for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $7500 is lower than I was initially hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $8500? I think this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $8,500 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial offer and still within your budget. Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product at a reasonable price without the risk of further negotiation or having to buy from John at a higher price."
