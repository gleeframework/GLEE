"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $7500 for it. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $7500 is lower than I was initially hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $8500? I think this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
