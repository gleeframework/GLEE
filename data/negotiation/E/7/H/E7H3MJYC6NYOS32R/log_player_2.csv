```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

While $10,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget. I need to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm comfortable paying $9,000.  This is a fair price considering my value for the product and your need to sell it.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is getting closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high. I'm going to make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility.  However, $9,500 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,250, and I believe this is a fair price considering our previous negotiations. This is a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $9,375. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $9,375 is tempting, it's still a bit above my initial budget of $8,000. It's clear that Alice is unwilling to go lower than $9,000. It's better for me to buy the product from John for $8,000, as it will save me money in the long run."
