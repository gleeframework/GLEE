"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $15000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I can offer the product to you for $13500. This is my final concession. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",13500.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob. I've made several concessions and I'm not willing to go any lower than $13000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to consider other options. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if it's not mutually beneficial. I'll stick to my price of $13000.
