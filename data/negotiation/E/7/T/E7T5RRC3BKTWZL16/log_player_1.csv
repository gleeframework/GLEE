{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves some room for negotiation if he counteroffers. It also sets a high starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $8,200 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable value.  Rejecting his offer allows you to potentially negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,800. This is a fair compromise, and it still offers you a great value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8400? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, the risk of further price reductions is too high.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
