"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll see.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, as that's the maximum I can afford right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget limitations, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I'm confident it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is my final offer, as I'm not comfortable going higher. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
