"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, as that's the maximum I can afford right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget limitations, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I'm confident it reflects a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is my final offer, as I'm not comfortable going higher. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, his ""final offer"" of $900,000 is still significantly below my minimum.  It's unlikely we'll bridge that gap in the remaining rounds. It's more profitable to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
