"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $7,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a great start, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $6,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 6500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept the price of 6500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for 6800. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price of $7,000 to $6,800. This is a good compromise and brings the price closer to Bob's desired range.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $1,200 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation is possible, the potential savings are smaller and the risk of Alice walking away increases."
