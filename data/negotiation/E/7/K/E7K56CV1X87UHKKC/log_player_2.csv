"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I believe this product has a lot of value to offer, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. With that said, I'm going to start with an offer of $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price of $1,200,000.  There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible with the price.  I'm very interested in this product, but unfortunately, my budget is capped at $1,200,000.  If you're willing to come down to that price, we have a deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm going to counteroffer at $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, Bob is still $50,000 above his target price.  He should continue to negotiate in hopes of getting closer to his budget. There's still room for compromise, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but unfortunately,  $1,250,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,225,000, which is a fair price considering we're both meeting in the middle. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $1,225,000. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'm going to counteroffer at $1,235,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,235,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,235,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,235,000 is only $35,000 above Bob's target price of $1,200,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further,  it's likely that Alice won't come down much more. Accepting this offer is a good compromise, allowing Bob to secure the product without exceeding his budget significantly.  There's a strong chance that continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate or even Alice walking away from the deal, potentially forcing Bob to buy from John at his full price."
