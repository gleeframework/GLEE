"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I believe this product has a lot of value to offer, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. With that said, I'm going to start with an offer of $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible with the price.  I'm very interested in this product, but unfortunately, my budget is capped at $1,200,000.  If you're willing to come down to that price, we have a deal.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm going to counteroffer at $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but unfortunately,  $1,250,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,225,000, which is a fair price considering we're both meeting in the middle. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $1,225,000. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I'm going to counteroffer at $1,235,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1235000.0,Alice,5,
