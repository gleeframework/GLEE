"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your potential profit. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment.

Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1150000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1050000. It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. However, I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1125000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
