"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think $9,000 is a bit high, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be totally honest, my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down a little more?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your transparency. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is my final offer, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're close.  I'm willing to budge a little to avoid wasting more time. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I still think the product's value is worth a bit more than that. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $11,250. This is my last offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  You said $11,500 was your final offer.  I'm willing to pay $10,900, but that's absolutely it.  Take it or leave it.",10900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to drive a hard bargain, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $10,900. I've already made concessions, and I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to be realistic about the price. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. This is my last counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,9,
