It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Price is Right:** $11,000 is a reasonable price, well below your $15,000 maximum and a decent savings.
* **Alice is Firm:**  She's indicated this is her final offer multiple times. Pushing further might make her walk away.
* **Time is Running Out:** You only have one round left after this. If you fail to reach a deal with Alice, you'll have to buy from John at the higher price. 

While you could try for a slightly lower price in the final round, it's risky. Accepting now guarantees you get the product at a price you're comfortable with."
