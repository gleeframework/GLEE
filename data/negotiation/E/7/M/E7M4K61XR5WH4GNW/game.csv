"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $750,000 is a good starting point, I need to stay closer to my asking price.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's fair to me as well. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, I need to be closer to $800,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? It's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Alice,5,
