"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see and allows for some room for negotiation.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is quite a distance from my initial asking price and significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  To move forward, I could consider $1,900,000. This reflects a willingness to compromise while still recognizing the inherent value.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  To make progress, I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product while remaining within my financial constraints.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
