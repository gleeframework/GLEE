Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see and allows for some room for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is quite a distance from my initial asking price and significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  To move forward, I could consider $1,900,000. This reflects a willingness to compromise while still recognizing the inherent value."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  To make progress, I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product while remaining within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob has now met my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to negotiate for more, there's no guarantee he'll go higher. It's best to accept the sure thing and avoid the risk of losing both Bob and John as potential buyers."
