"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential return on investment for my business.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This would still be a significant gain for you, and a fair price considering the potential benefits this product can bring to your business.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you at $875,000, but no higher than that. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I can get out of this product.",875000.0,Bob,4,
