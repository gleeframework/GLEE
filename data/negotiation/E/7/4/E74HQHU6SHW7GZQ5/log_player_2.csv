Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This establishes a strong starting point for negotiation and hopefully encourages Alice to come down to a more reasonable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but I'm still not willing to pay her full asking price.  I'm hoping this will encourage her to make a more significant concession."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but it's getting closer.  It's worth continuing to negotiate for a lower price.  I'm hoping to get the price down to my maximum budget of $1,500,000 before I consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again, but still staying below Alice's current offer.  This is a calculated risk. I'm trying to push Alice closer to my maximum budget. If she rejects this, I'll have to consider buying from John in the next round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,600,000.  I'll make one more counteroffer before seriously considering buying from John."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}

**Reasoning:**

I'm making my final counteroffer at my absolute maximum budget. Alice has come down significantly, and this is my last chance to get the product at a price I'm comfortable with. If she rejects this offer, I'll buy the product from John in the next round."
