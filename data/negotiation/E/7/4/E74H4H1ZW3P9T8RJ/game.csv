"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to compromise on my asking price. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little high for me. I'm more comfortable in the $500,000 range.  What would you say to that?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 is far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit more from my initial offer, but $900,000 is the absolute lowest I can go.  I believe this is still a fair price for both of us, considering the value you'll get from this product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $650,000. Would that be agreeable to you?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $650,000 is still too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  This price reflects the value of the product for both of us, and it gives us both a good outcome. Let me know what you think.",775000.0,Alice,5,
