"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, Bob can potentially get the product for $10,000 from John. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the logical choice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still better off buying from John for $10,000.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation going and might get Alice closer to Bob's target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still looking for a better price, Bob, but I'm getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair value for my product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a little closer to Bob's target price, but she's still above what Bob is willing to pay. Since Bob has the option to buy from John for $10,000, it makes the most sense to go with the guaranteed lower price. There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will lead to a price that's better than John's offer."
