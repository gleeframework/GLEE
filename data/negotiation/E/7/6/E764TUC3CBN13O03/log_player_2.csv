"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Considering its worth to us and its potential value to you, I propose a price of $120 for it. I hope this aligns with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $100.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $100 for the product, which I believe is fair given its value to me.  Let me know if you're open to that price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your input. Considering the value you place on the product and our costs, I'd like to counter your offer with a price of $110. This is a reasonable compromise that reflects both the value you see in the product and our business interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still above my maximum budget of $100. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of not reaching an agreement within the 10 rounds is too high.  It's safer to go with John's offer of $100, which guarantees I get the product within my budget."
