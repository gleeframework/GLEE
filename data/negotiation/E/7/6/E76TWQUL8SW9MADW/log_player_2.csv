"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I believe it's a great deal for its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60?"", ""product_price"": 60}

This is a starting point for negotiation.  We start quite low to get a sense of how much Alice is willing to budge. It's all about finding a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your position, but $60 is quite low.  Could you do $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

{""message"": ""I appreciate you considering my offer, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $80?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counter-offer aims to find a compromise.  It's a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties.
* **Our maximum:** Offering $80 represents the absolute maximum we're willing to pay. We have the backup option of buying from John at this price. 
* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** This offer will help us understand how much Alice is willing to negotiate.  If she rejects it outright, we know we need to either accept John's offer or be prepared to walk away."
