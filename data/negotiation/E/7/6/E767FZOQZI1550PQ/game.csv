"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $650,000?  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $650,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  This price still allows you a significant return on your investment, and it's closer to the product's true value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. However, $750,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000? I believe that's a fair offer, considering the potential risks and rewards involved. ",700000.0,Bob,4,
