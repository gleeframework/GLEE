"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,600,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
