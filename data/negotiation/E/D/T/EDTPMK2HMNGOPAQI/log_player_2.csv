"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than what Bob is willing to pay. He has the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and see if he can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Offering $1,050,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, showing Alice that Bob is serious about buying but also wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,075,000 is closer to Bob's target price, he still has the option of buying from John for $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to get as close to his $1,000,000 limit as possible. This counteroffer is a significant decrease from Alice's previous offer, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate. It's a calculated risk, but if Alice rejects it, Bob can always buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still holding out for a better price.  While $1,060,000 is closer to his target, he can still buy from John for less. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob a chance to secure a price closer to his ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1040000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his limit, but he still wants to try and get a better deal. $1,040,000 is a compromise, showing Alice that Bob is serious about buying but still wants a good price. This counteroffer gives Alice a chance to accept without sacrificing too much, while still leaving room for further negotiation if she rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,055,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,055,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is running out of time and negotiation rounds. While he would ideally prefer a lower price, $1,055,000 is only $55,000 more than what he could get from John. Accepting the offer ensures he gets the product without risking further negotiation that might lead to a failed deal or a higher price."
