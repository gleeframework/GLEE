"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this product, but I have to make a profit, so I'm asking $140 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $140 is significantly higher than your $80 limit and John's offer. Buying from John is the most financially sensible option."
