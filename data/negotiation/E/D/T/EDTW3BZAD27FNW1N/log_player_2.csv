"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $150 to me. Given its high quality and unique features, I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection. Considering its worth to both of us, I propose a price of $120 for you to experience all its benefits. I trust this offer will meet your expectations and provide you with excellent value for your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer ($120):** While this is a discount from Alice's perceived value, it's still more than your maximum budget of $100 and more expensive than buying from John.
* **John's Offer ($100):** This meets your budget and is the best price available.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can proceed to buy from John and get the best deal."
