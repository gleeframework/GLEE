"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for your product.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the value I see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1500000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This price is still fair for both of us, and it allows for a successful transaction. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1750000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1600000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial constraints.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
