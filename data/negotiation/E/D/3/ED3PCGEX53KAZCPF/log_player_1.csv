Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, but not too far off.  This gives me room to negotiate, while still demonstrating the value I place on the product. I'm hoping Bob will counter, allowing us to find a price we're both happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm hoping to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $95. This is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still securing a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this counteroffer is appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $80 was probably too low. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $90 is still a good price, and it seems like Bob is firm on that number.  It's a win-win situation, as I'm getting a decent price, and Bob is getting the product he wants."
