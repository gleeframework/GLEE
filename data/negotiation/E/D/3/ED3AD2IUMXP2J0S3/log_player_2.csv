"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can still get a better deal than $14,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's product is worth $10,000 to her, so she's already making a decent profit at $14,000.  This counteroffer gives her a good margin, but still saves me $2,000 compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,000, which is a good price for me. While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will come down any more, and I risk losing the deal entirely.  Buying from John would cost me more, so accepting Alice's offer is the best option here."
