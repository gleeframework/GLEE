"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this work. This product is worth a lot, and I believe it will be a great asset for you.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That's a fair offer considering the current market and the value it holds for me.",800000.0,Bob,4,
