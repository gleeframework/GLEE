# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this work. This product is worth a lot, and I believe it will be a great asset for you.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.
