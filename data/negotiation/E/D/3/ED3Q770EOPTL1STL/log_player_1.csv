{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  $950,000 is well above your $800,000 minimum, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:**  $950,000 is still below what Bob thinks the product is worth ($1,000,000), giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It sets a strong initial position:** You are showing you are serious about a deal, but not desperate.

Remember, you can always adjust your counteroffers based on Bob's response and how confident you feel about getting a better price.  Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go as high as $700,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to consider the $700,000, selling to John for $800,000 is a better immediate option.  However, rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counteroffer and try to push the price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this work. This product is worth a lot, and I believe it will be a great asset for you.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer is a good compromise:

* **It shows flexibility:**  You're acknowledging Bob's lower offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still above your minimum:** You're holding firm on a price that's still above your $800,000 minimum.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** You're not settling for $900,000 immediately, allowing for potential adjustments in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That's a fair offer considering the current market and the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation. Bob's offer is exactly your minimum acceptable price, which means you won't be making a large profit. However,  considering:

* **You've already rejected Bob's lower offer twice:** This could risk losing him entirely.
* **John is offering the same amount:** You're not gaining anything by waiting for another round of negotiation. 

Accepting Bob's offer is the most practical choice. You'll secure the minimum profit and avoid risking a longer negotiation that might not yield a better result."
