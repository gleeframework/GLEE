"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value and features, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny!"", 
""product_price"": 22000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a strong anchor price significantly above my minimum ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Confident Demeanor:** My message emphasizes the product's value to justify the high price and project confidence in the offer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. It sets the stage for a potential compromise while keeping me in a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While he's expressed interest, I have ample room to negotiate before considering selling to John.  I'll provide a counteroffer to guide the price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $12,000 undervalues the product's true worth and capabilities.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $19,000. I believe this reflects the value you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** I've made a significant concession ($3,000) to show flexibility but combined it with a clear message that $12,000 is too low.  This reinforces the product's value.
* **Moving Closer:**  My counteroffer aims to shift the negotiation into a range where a mutually beneficial agreement is more likely.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By proactively making another offer, I guide the negotiation's direction and maintain control of the pace."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $19,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $14,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is now above my absolute minimum of $15,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, continuing carries the risk that Bob walks away. Accepting now secures a good profit.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids further delays and the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
