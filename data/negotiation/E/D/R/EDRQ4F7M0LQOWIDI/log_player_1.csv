Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows her product's value to her ($15,000) and Bob's maximum valuation ($10,000). She starts with a high offer ($19,000) to test Bob's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial offer allows space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still staying above Alice's minimum acceptable price. 
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, giving her leverage in the negotiation. She's not desperate to sell to Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's profit by:

1. **Potentially securing a high sale price from Bob.**
2. **Setting a strong starting point for negotiation.**
3. **Ensuring she doesn't sell for less than her guaranteed price from John.**"
