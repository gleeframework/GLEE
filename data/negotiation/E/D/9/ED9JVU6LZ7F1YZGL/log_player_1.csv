Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. I believe this is the best compromise considering the value and my budget.

While we're still above John's offer, Bob is clearly sticking to a tight budget and is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting at $1,080,000 secures a profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
