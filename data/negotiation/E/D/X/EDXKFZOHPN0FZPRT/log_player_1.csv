This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our discussion."", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $900,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
