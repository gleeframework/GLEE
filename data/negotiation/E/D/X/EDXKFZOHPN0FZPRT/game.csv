"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000 for the product. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our discussion.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $900,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the negotiations so far.",875000.0,Alice,3,
