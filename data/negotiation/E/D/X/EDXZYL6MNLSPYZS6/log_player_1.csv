"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  This gives us both a good deal - it's significantly lower than what I'd pay elsewhere, and it's still well above your minimum.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
