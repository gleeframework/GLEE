"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I want to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,080,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to where I need to be. What do you think?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to what I want, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I have a few rounds left and I believe I can get a better offer.  I'm not willing to sell to John yet, as I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob."
