Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is a compromise from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000.

While I could try to push for a lower price, getting Alice down to $980,000 is a good deal. It's a significant savings compared to John's offer and it avoids the risk of further negotiation."
