Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $9,000 for the product. I'm confident that you'll find it a fair price, but I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
