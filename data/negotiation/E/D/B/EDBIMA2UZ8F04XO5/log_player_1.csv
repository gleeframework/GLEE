``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate, but still leaves room for me to potentially make a profit. If Bob rejects the offer, I can always go back to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $6,000 is significantly below my minimum value for the product. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground, but if he doesn't budge, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $8,500. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $8,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll counteroffer again, but if Bob remains inflexible, I'll sell to John to guarantee my minimum value."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $7,000 is still too low for me. Let's compromise at $8,000. It's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
