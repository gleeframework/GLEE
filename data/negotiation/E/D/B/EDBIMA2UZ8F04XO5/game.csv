"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $8,500. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $8,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $7,000 is still too low for me. Let's compromise at $8,000. It's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
