"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. As we've discussed, the product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair and reasonable price considering its value to you. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $900,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  $1,100,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While I value the product,  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $975,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer.  Let's aim for a final agreement that benefits both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,
