"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $95, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room for negotiation to get closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $95 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $70? I think that's a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Offering $70 is a strong starting point. It's closer to Alice's value ($80) and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message aims to be respectful while clearly stating the price is too high. Suggesting $70 as a ""fair price"" encourages Alice to consider a lower offer.
* **Strategic:** By starting low, we might learn how flexible Alice is willing to be. Her response will help determine our next move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $70 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little to $85. This still gives you a great deal, and it's a price I can accept.  Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice coming down to $85 is a good sign, showing she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Room for Improvement:** However, $85 is still a significant markup from her $80 value. We haven't reached a point where accepting is the best option.
* **Negotiating Power:** We're closer to her bottom line, but we still have the option to buy from John for $100. This gives us leverage to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand $70 was a bit low, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $78?  That's a solid offer, and I'm ready to buy if you're happy with it."", 
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  After Alice's counter, we're in a range of $70-$85. $78 is a compromise, showing willingness to move up while still seeking a good deal.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Adding ""I'm ready to buy"" implies this is a serious offer and we're eager to close the deal. It might encourage Alice to accept rather than risk further negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  While closer to her value, $78 still gives us a small buffer below John's $100 price. This maintains some leverage in case Alice counters again."
