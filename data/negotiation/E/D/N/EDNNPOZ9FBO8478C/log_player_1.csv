Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a starting point. I'm aiming high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me. If Bob rejects, I'll gauge his interest and adjust my counteroffer accordingly. I'm also keeping John in mind, as a safety net if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than $1,500,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
``` 
I'm lowering the price slightly, but still leaving room for negotiation. This counteroffer shows I'm flexible but still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is higher than John's and is close to my initial target price. It's a good deal, and I'm confident I won't get a significantly better offer."
