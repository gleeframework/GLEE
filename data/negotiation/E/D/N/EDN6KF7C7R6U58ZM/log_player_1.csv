"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting high, at $14,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to maximize my earnings while still keeping the possibility of a deal open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counteroffer in the next round. There's still a chance to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $13,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, but it shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal.  It's also still above Bob's perceived value and leaves some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is getting closer to my desired profit, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counteroffer again.  The risk of losing this deal is higher now, but I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $12,500.  This is my final counteroffer to Bob.  I'm close to my minimum price, but I believe I can still secure a deal with Bob.  If he rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price, and with only four rounds left, the risk of not getting a better offer is too high. I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $12,000. This ensures I meet my minimum profit goal and avoids any further potential loss."
