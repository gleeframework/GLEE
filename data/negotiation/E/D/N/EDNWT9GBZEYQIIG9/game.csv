"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $8,500. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,4,
