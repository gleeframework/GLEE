Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a valuable asset and I believe this price reflects its worth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than that. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, securing the deal now is important. I have 9 rounds left and there's no guarantee of a better offer in the future.  Selling to Bob now guarantees me my minimum desired value."
