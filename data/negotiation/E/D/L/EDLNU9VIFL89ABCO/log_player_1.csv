Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $120 as possible, as that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested, while still securing you a near-maximum profit.
* **Appeal to Value:** Highlighting the product's value aims to justify the price and make it more appealing to Bob."
