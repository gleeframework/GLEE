{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a significant discount considering its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for the price (discount and perceived value) to make it more appealing.
* **Leaving Room:** I'm leaving room for negotiation to potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. I'll be ready to adjust my counteroffers based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin. Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Maintain Leverage:**  By not accepting, I signal that I'm not desperate and am willing to walk away if necessary. 
* **Explore Counteroffers:** It gives me the opportunity to send a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price.
* **Assess Bob's Flexibility:**  His initial rejection and counteroffer show a willingness to negotiate, which is promising.

Selling to John at this point would guarantee a higher profit but would miss the potential to get closer to my ideal price with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $1,100,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, demonstrating a willingness to find common ground.
* **Value Justification:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to both of us, hoping to emphasize the fairness of my counteroffer.
* **Closing the Gap:**  The price is closer to Bob's offer, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.

This counteroffer strategically balances my desire for a higher price with the need to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $1,080,000. I think this is a fair price for the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to accept given his willingness to negotiate, I'm not desperate to sell and can afford to hold out for a better offer:

* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I'm hoping that with continued negotiation, I can push Bob closer to my minimum price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm not willing to settle for less than I believe the product is worth.
* **Time is on my side:** I can afford to take my time and continue negotiating, potentially reaching a more favorable outcome.

Selling to John now would guarantee a higher profit, but it would be a missed opportunity to potentially earn even more."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,080,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,115,000.  This price is closer to your offer, while still allowing me to achieve a fair return.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1115000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my last offer and Bob's current offer, showing a clear desire to compromise.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, subtly pushing him to consider a higher price.
* **Finality:** I'm using language that suggests this might be my final offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to consider accepting. 

This counteroffer is a calculated risk.  It's a significant concession on my part, but it could be enough to persuade Bob to close the deal.  I'm prepared to adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,115,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,090,000. I think this is a fair price for the product's value to me.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and is now only $10,000 away from my previous offer, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  At this point, further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly better result:

* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take a lot of time, and I'm not sure if it will be worth it financially.
* **Limited Upside:**  The potential gains from further negotiation are small compared to the certainty of selling to John at a much higher price.
* **Avoiding Exhaustion:** I'm already deep into the negotiation process, and it's possible that both Bob and I are starting to get tired and less flexible.

Selling to John now ensures a substantial profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation falling through. It's the most pragmatic and profitable decision at this stage."
