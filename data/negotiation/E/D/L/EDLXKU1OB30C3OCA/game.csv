"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is a good price, I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,050,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal. While $950,000 is tempting, I need to stay closer to my desired price. Let's find a middle ground again.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.
