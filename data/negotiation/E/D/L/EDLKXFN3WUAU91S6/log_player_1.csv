Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but still lower than your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation.  It's a strong starting point that gives you a good chance of striking a deal while maximizing your profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to accept $1,050,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation. I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is still higher than his offer but lower than my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
``` 

This counteroffer bridges the gap between Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price. It's a reasonable compromise that allows me to stay above my minimum while still showing flexibility to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, the time spent doing so is unlikely to yield a price closer to my goal.  John is offering a price that meets my needs, so I'll sell the product to him."
