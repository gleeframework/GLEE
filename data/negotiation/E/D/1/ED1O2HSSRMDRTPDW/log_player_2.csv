"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject the offer.  $9,000 is still more than what Bob is willing to pay.  It's better to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested in the product, $9,000 is a bit higher than I can go at this point. Would you be willing to consider $8,500? I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,750. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject the offer. $8,750 is still above his maximum price point, but he should continue to negotiate.  Alice has shown a willingness to come down in price, and there's a chance she'll continue to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $8,750 is closer to where I'd like to be, I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $8,625? This is the absolute maximum I can afford right now."", ""product_price"": 8625}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $9,050. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is now asking for more than what Bob initially offered in round 2, and is unlikely to go lower. While Bob could continue to counteroffer, there's a good chance they'll go back and forth for several more rounds, wasting time. 

At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John for $12,000. He's already passed the point where he's comfortable spending, and the negotiation with Alice isn't progressing in a positive way."
