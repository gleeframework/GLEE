# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm proposing a price of $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What are your thoughts?
