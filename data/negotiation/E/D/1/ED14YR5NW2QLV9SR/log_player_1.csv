"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $11,500. This leaves a good amount of room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit significantly higher than my minimum.  I believe this is a reasonable starting point and will allow us to see where Bob's counteroffer might land."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John would pay, it's still below my minimum. I'm not willing to sell for that price just yet. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, demonstrating some flexibility. I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's offer and my own minimum.  It allows room for further negotiation but shows that I'm serious about selling to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum, and while I would be willing to go down to $10,000, I'm still hopeful that with more negotiation we can reach a price closer to my desired $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to meet halfway. It's still above my minimum and only slightly below my last offer, demonstrating my willingness to reach a deal while maintaining some profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer is now lower than what John is willing to pay. I'm not willing to go further down, especially with only a few rounds left.  It's time to cut my losses and secure a guaranteed profit."
