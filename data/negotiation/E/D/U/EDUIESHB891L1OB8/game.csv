,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I see the value in the product, $15,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this happen. How about $14,000?  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
