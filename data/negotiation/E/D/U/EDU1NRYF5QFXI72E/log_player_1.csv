Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider selling it to me for $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $15,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a great deal on this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Let's aim for a compromise. How about $13,200 for the product? This keeps your profit margin reasonable while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable with a sale at that price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not quite there yet.  $13,200 is a good offer, but I'd really prefer to sell it for $13,400. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a reasonable profit while you still get a great deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13400}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your patience. I think we're getting closer. How about we settle on $13,300 for the product? It's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,300

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price of $15,000, $13,300 is a reasonable compromise and a good return on the product.  I'm also concerned that if I reject this offer, Bob might walk away from the deal completely, and I might not be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds."
