"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000.**  
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **It's worth exploring if you can get closer to your desired price.**  You can always choose to buy from John if the negotiation with Alice doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my needs.  While I see the value in this product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, showing your serious intent to negotiate.  
* **Justified Offer:** It's not unreasonable to start at $9,000, considering your maximum budget of $10,000 and the fact that you have another option with John.
* **Leaves Room for Compromise:**  This counteroffer provides room for a middle ground during negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $10,000.**  
* **It's worth trying to negotiate further.**  You're very close to your desired price, and a small counteroffer might sway Alice. 
* **You can always go with John if the negotiation fails.**  However, getting a slightly better price from Alice is worth exploring."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. I'm still a bit over my budget at $10,500. How about we split the difference and I pay $10,250?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer close to Alice's offer:** By suggesting $10,250, you show Alice you're serious about purchasing the product and willing to meet her halfway.
* **Emphasize compromise:** By mentioning ""splitting the difference,"" you frame the counteroffer as a fair solution for both parties.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  The message remains polite and respectful, aiming to keep the negotiation open."
