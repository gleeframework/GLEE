Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your initial offer, but $8,000 is significantly below the true value of this product and what I can accept.  To be fair, how about we meet in the middle at $14,000?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. However, $14,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,500?  That feels like a fair offer to me."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find common ground, but we're still quite far apart.  I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. $13,000 is my absolute lowest price.  I'm confident this product is worth the investment, but I also need to be fair to myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product holds value for you, and I respect that you need to be fair to yourself.  How about we try $11,000?  That's a significant jump from my last offer, and I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer. I'm motivated to close this deal, but $13,000 is the best I can do. To show I'm serious about finding a solution, I'm willing to throw in [add a small but tangible bonus related to the product], which I think you'll find valuable.  Does that work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems firmly set at $13,000 even with a small bonus. It's unlikely she'll go down significantly in the remaining rounds. Accepting her offer would mean overpaying by $3,000 compared to John's price. It's more financially sensible to cut losses and buy from John for a guaranteed $10,000."
