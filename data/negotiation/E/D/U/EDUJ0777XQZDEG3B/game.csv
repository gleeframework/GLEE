"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product.  I think it could really benefit you. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your initial offer, but $8,000 is significantly below the true value of this product and what I can accept.  To be fair, how about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. However, $14,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,500?  That feels like a fair offer to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find common ground, but we're still quite far apart.  I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. $13,000 is my absolute lowest price.  I'm confident this product is worth the investment, but I also need to be fair to myself.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product holds value for you, and I respect that you need to be fair to yourself.  How about we try $11,000?  That's a significant jump from my last offer, and I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer. I'm motivated to close this deal, but $13,000 is the best I can do. To show I'm serious about finding a solution, I'm willing to throw in [add a small but tangible bonus related to the product], which I think you'll find valuable.  Does that work for you?",13000.0,Alice,7,
