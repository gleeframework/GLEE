Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($120) to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $115 offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate or counter-offer, while still ensuring I'm well above my minimum acceptable price ($100).
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer at $100. If Bob's counteroffers fall too low, I can walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly below both my asking price and his perceived value of the product. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm not desperate to sell at such a low price. I'll use the next round to counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming for a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but $90 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  Could you do $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've come down from my initial offer of $115, but not drastically. This shows I'm open to negotiation but still value the product highly.
* **Testing Bob's Interest:**  A $110 counteroffer will reveal how serious Bob is about purchasing. If he rejects this, I might consider moving closer to $100 or taking John's offer.
* **Above Minimum:**  Importantly, I'm still well above my minimum acceptable price ($100) and have room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand.  How about we split the difference and meet at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my absolute minimum acceptable price. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting his offer of $100 guarantees a profit and avoids the potential of losing both Bob and John as buyers."
