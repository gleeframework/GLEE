"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1 million to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.  This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price point that's well below its true market value.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",950000.0,Alice,1,
