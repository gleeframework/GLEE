"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $950000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $900000 for this incredible product.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $875000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you, but I'm still not comfortable with $875000.  Let's split the difference.  How about $887500?  That's a fair compromise and a great deal for both of us.  It's a fantastic product, and I'm sure you'll agree it's worth every penny.",887500.0,Alice,5,
