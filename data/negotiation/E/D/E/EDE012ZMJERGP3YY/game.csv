"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $950,000 is a bit steep for me at this stage. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it, considering the value it holds for me and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $750,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the value of the product to you, while also being more competitive than my initial offer. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to offer right now.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product while also allowing for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you. Let me know what you think.",825000.0,Alice,5,
