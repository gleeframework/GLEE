"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle or consider a slight discount?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I could be flexible but need to get closer to my asking price. How about we settle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider $14,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
