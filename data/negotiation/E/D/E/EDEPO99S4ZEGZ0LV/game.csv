"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $17,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Could you do $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. If you're serious, I can go down to $14,000. This is my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
