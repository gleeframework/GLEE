"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm offering it for $130.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($150) than my minimum ($100). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This first offer helps me understand how eager Bob is to buy. His response will indicate if I need to adjust my strategy in the next rounds.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John gives me leverage. I won't settle for anything too low from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $110 is better than John's $100, but it's still quite far from my initial ask and leaves a significant chunk of potential profit on the table.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe I can secure a better deal by countering in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate by moving closer to his offer. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $120 is a classic negotiation tactic, suggesting fairness and potentially making Bob more receptive.
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm still aiming for a price that's comfortably above my minimum, ensuring a decent profit if Bob accepts."
