# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's worth a premium price considering its value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

While $14,000 isn't a terrible price, you know you can get the product for $15,000 from John. There's a chance Alice might lower her price in a subsequent offer, allowing you to save even more money."
