"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a limited time. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to let it go for $12000.",12000.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"I'm very interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a unique product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,10000.0
"I understand that $9000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'd like to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is a great deal considering the value it offers, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",10500.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice. However, $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value you're offering, and I'm willing to make a decision if you can meet me at this price.",9500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,10000.0
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a decision. I'm willing to meet you at $9500, but I'd like to add a bit of a premium for the value it brings. I can do $9800, and that's as low as I can go.",9800.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $9800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $9800, which would be $9650. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and finalize the deal.",9650.0,Bob,6,,
