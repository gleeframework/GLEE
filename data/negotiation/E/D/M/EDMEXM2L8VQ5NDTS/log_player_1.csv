"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I can always adjust my offer downwards in the following rounds.  It's important to remember I have the option to sell to John for $10,000 at any point, so I don't want to undervalue the product too early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm willing to take the risk and continue negotiating with Bob. I believe there's still room to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $12,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm serious about negotiating but also that I'm willing to compromise. If he rejects, I'll have to consider my options more seriously in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I've already lowered my price significantly, and I'm hoping to get a bit more.  I'm still confident that I can get a better deal with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $11,000. This is another compromise, and I'm getting closer to Bob's offers. However, I'm still holding out for a bit more. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John for $10,000, as we are running out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting close to the end, and I need to be realistic.  While $9,500 is tempting,  I'm not sure Bob is willing to go any higher.  I've made significant concessions already.  To avoid risking a lower offer from Bob or running out of rounds, I'm going to sell to John for $10,000. This guarantees me my minimum value and a quick sale."
