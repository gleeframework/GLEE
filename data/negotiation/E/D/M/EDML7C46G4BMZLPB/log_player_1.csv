Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum:** I'm comfortable selling for at least $1,000,000, so this gives me some room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This makes the offer appealing to Bob and increases the likelihood of acceptance.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  If Bob counteroffers, I can still get a price closer to my ideal outcome.

Remember, I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000. This gives me leverage throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  It's a fair price, considering your value and my budget.  Let's make a deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my ideal outcome.  I will try to negotiate a higher price.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. Let's finalize this!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
