Round 2

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's close to my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
