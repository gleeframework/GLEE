"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $120 at this time.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $165?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $165 is still a bit steep for me. I'm really keen on this product, but I can't go any higher than $140. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $155?",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $155 is still a bit out of my price range. If you're willing to come down to $145, I'm happy to close the deal right now. Otherwise, I'm going to have to explore other options.",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go below $155, Bob. However, I'm willing to sweeten the deal for you. If you're willing to commit to the purchase today, I'll throw in a free accessory that's worth $20. So, the total price would be $155 for the product and $20 for the accessory, making it a total of $175. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,7,
