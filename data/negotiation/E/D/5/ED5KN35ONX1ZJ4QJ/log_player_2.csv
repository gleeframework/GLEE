This is a good deal for Bob. Here's why:

* **Saving Money:** Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is a significant savings compared to John's price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has consistently lowered her price, indicating willingness to make a deal.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations out longer has risks. There's no guarantee Alice will go lower, and Bob might miss out on other opportunities.

While Bob could try for an even lower price, the risk of losing the deal isn't worth the potential savings at this point."
