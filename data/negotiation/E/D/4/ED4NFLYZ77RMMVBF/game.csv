"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $110?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to find the best price, but $105 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $108.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be well worth the investment.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not sure if $108 is the best deal for me. How about $107?,107.0,Bob,6,
