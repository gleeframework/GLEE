"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I was thinking of $120. Let me know if that's something you'd be open to.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $120 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I understand that $150 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $130. Would you be willing to consider this price?",130.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $130 is still a bit low for me, but I'm open to coming down a bit more.  I'm willing to sell for $140.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",140.0,Alice,5,
