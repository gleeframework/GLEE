Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  However, $2,000,000 is still far above what I'm comfortable paying.  To be frank, anything over $1,100,000 and I'm better off exploring other options. I'm willing to go to $1,100,000 if you're serious about selling. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
