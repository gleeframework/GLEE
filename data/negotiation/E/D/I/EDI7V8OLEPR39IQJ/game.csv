"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth the investment. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still looking for something closer to my initial offer. How about $1,100,000? This would give you a great deal on a product you value at $800,000 and would leave me a fair return on my investment. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product if we can agree on this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
