Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still looking for something closer to my initial offer. How about $1,100,000? This would give you a great deal on a product you value at $800,000 and would leave me a fair return on my investment. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

I think this is a fair compromise considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product if we can agree on this price.
