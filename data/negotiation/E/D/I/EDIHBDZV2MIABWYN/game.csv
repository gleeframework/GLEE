"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. I'm also keeping in mind that I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay $1000000, so I'm not in a rush to sell. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $1075000, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher than that. I'm still considering selling to John, and I want to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible.

"Bob, I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $1075000. Your latest offer of $1050000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're running out of time, and I'm still considering selling to John. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll propose $1062500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1062500.0,Alice,9,
