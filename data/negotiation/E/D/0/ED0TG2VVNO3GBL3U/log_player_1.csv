"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $7,500 for the product. I'm confident that we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I want to get the best price, it's too early to sell to John. I'm hoping to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated for the value of the product. I'm offering you the product for $8,500. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,250. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,250 is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a good deal considering we're already in round 4.  There's a chance Bob might reject future counteroffers or that I might have to sell to John at the lower price.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale at a decent price."
