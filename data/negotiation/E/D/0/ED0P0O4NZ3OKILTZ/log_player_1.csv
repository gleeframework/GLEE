"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's below my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to start the negotiation by offering a higher price, indicating he's interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my valuation and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's below my minimum price, and I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my value. I want to see if I can push Bob further towards my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  The product has a significant value, and I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1,350,000.  This offer would still allow you to secure the product at a price well below my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This reflects the value I see in the product, while still staying within my budget. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I believe I can push for a higher price and potentially reach a point where selling to Bob is more advantageous than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still below my desired price.  Given the product's value, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,375,000. This offer bridges the gap between our current positions and allows for further discussion. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
