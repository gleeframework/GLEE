"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my valuation and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  The product has a significant value, and I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1,350,000.  This offer would still allow you to secure the product at a price well below my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, he still has room to negotiate.  He has already demonstrated his willingness to pay up to $1,250,000, so there is potential for further compromise. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further, especially since there are still several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This reflects the value I see in the product, while still staying within my budget. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still below my desired price.  Given the product's value, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,375,000. This offer bridges the gap between our current positions and allows for further discussion. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above Bob's maximum budget, even after a few rounds of negotiation. While there's still potential to negotiate further, the risk of going over Bob's budget is high. It's time to take the sure thing and buy from John. 

* **Security:**  Buying from John guarantees Bob will get the product for his maximum price, eliminating any risk of overpaying.
* **Time:**  With only 5 rounds left, further negotiation might not yield a better outcome, and could lead to a stalemate.

While Bob might be able to squeeze a slightly lower price from Alice, the certainty of John's offer outweighs the potential gains of continuing with Alice."
