,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my valuation and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  The product has a significant value, and I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1,350,000.  This offer would still allow you to secure the product at a price well below my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This reflects the value I see in the product, while still staying within my budget. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still below my desired price.  Given the product's value, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,375,000. This offer bridges the gap between our current positions and allows for further discussion. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
