"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $82. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice. How about $75? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to make the deal right now.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I've already compromised a lot by offering $82 earlier. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $79. It's a fair price, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",79.0,Alice,5,
