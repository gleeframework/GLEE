Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that reflects its value. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $1,300,000?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Starting significantly above Bob's perceived value leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's benefits without revealing your bottom line, encouraging Bob to engage.
* **Alternative buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate, and Bob might sense that.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale. If Bob negotiates, you have room to decrease the price while still remaining above your minimum. If he rejects the offer, you can proceed with John, ensuring you receive your desired amount."
