Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you and my minimum asking price.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** It ensures you're still making a profit while leaving room for potential counteroffers.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This helps avoid misunderstandings and keeps the negotiation moving forward.

This is just the initial offer.  Be prepared to negotiate and be flexible, but remember your minimum price.  You can always go to John if Bob becomes unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I've done some research and I believe that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum asking price of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to accept his offer and avoid further negotiation, it's important to remember that:

* **My minimum is $1,500,000:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean a significant loss for me.
* **John is a guaranteed buyer:** I can always sell to John for $1,500,000.

Therefore, rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point.  I can try to meet somewhere in the middle or continue negotiating until a mutually acceptable price is reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price still allows me to make a profit and hopefully meets you halfway. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining a Profit:**  It's still above my minimum, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is polite and encouraging further discussion.

This counteroffer strikes a balance between firmness and flexibility, increasing the chances of reaching an agreement.  I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob continues to be unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from $1,200,000, so my counteroffer is $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm hesitant to accept because:

* **John's offer is better:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit.
* **Further negotiation is possible:** There's still room for Bob to increase his offer.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a final counteroffer. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I'm not losing out on a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 still falls short of my minimum.  I'm ready to make a final concession. I'll accept $1,375,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and provides a fair deal for both of us.  It's my final offer.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll be moving on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Concessions:** This is my last offer, demonstrating firmness while still being flexible.
* **Meeting Halfway (Almost):** I'm meeting Bob almost halfway from my previous offer, showing good faith. 
* **Deadline Implied:**  The message emphasizes that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob.

By presenting a final offer, I'm hoping to push Bob to accept. However, I'm also prepared to sell to John if Bob rejects. This strategy balances the need for a good price with the potential to secure a deal with a reliable buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,375,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, which is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Even though he claims it's his maximum, I'm not convinced he won't go higher if I reject his offer. However, I've already made several concessions and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation. 

Given that John is a guaranteed buyer at my desired price of $1,500,000, it's in my best interest to sell to him.  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a better outcome and may cost me valuable time."
