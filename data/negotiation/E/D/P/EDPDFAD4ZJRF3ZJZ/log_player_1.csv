I'm going to sell the product to John. I've gone through several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and it seems like we're at an impasse. It's unlikely I'll be able to get a better price from him. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, selling to John for $80 is a safe and secure option."
