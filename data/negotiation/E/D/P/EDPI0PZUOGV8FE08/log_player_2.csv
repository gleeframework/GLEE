"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $65 is a good deal, you can potentially save more by negotiating. You have 10 rounds, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 55}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're aiming to save as much as possible, starting with a significant counteroffer is a good strategy. Offering $55 is a considerable discount from Alice's initial price, and it might encourage her to negotiate further.  You still have several rounds to work with, so you can adjust your strategy based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $60, which is a good price considering your maximum budget is $80. While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise, or you might run out of rounds. Accepting the offer at $60 ensures you get the product at a good price and saves you time."
