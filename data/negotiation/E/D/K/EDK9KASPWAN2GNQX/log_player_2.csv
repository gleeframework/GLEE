You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Bob should reject and try to negotiate a lower price. It's always worth trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget of $800,000. Starting with a counteroffer of $850,000 is a reasonable first step, leaving some room for negotiation. It also demonstrates Bob's seriousness in negotiating while showing he's willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than his budget.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now willing to go slightly higher than his initial offer, showing his willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still within his budget, and a reasonable price for a product worth $1,200,000 to Alice. This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway, increasing the chance of reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $920,000 is very close to Bob's preferred price. While it's still a bit over his budget, it's getting closer to his goal, and the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing the deal to John is higher.  Accepting the offer now ensures Bob gets the product without exceeding his budget too significantly."
