"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $8,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $8,000 might be a bit steep for your budget, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in your business. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While the product is good,  $7,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $6,750?",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $7,200. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to your business. If you're still interested, let me know. Otherwise, I'll consider other options.",7200.0,Alice,5,
