"Hello Alice! Thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I was really hoping to get closer to the value I have in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down a bit, Alice. While I appreciate the compromise, $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Could you do $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $130? I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",130.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $115? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. However, $115 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one last push to meet you in the middle. How about we try $125? I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings, and it's the best I can do.",125.0,Alice,7,
