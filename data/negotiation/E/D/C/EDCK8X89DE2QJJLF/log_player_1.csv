Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, but still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but also ensures I get a good price if Bob accepts right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $130 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd like to sell it to him, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $110.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground between my minimum price and Bob's offer. By reducing my price to $110, I'm showing flexibility, but still maintaining a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a great deal. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob, especially since John is willing to pay my minimum price.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum profit without further negotiation."
