Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but that's my limit. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to $11,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $10,500?  That's a good compromise, and I think it's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing for more.  I'll take the $10,000 and move on."
