"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $180. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is much higher than both your maximum price and what John offers. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. However, $180 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This strategy aims to bring the price closer to your desired range. However, it's important to be prepared to negotiate upwards if Alice completely rejects this initial counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $120? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is coming down on her price, $120 is still more than you want to pay when you have the option of buying from John for $100. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

This counteroffer does a few things:

* **It meets your absolute maximum price:**  You are clear that this is the most you're willing to spend.
* **It offers a compromise:** By suggesting the middle ground between her previous offer and your last counteroffer, you show a willingness to negotiate.
* **It sets a firm boundary:** By stating it's your ""final offer"" you signal that you're prepared to walk away if Alice doesn't accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $130. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice. She's unwilling to meet your maximum price, and you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $100. This ensures you get the product without overpaying."
