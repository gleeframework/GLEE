"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $500000 for the product, considering its potential value to me.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500000 is a bit low for my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1250000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1250000 is still outside my comfortable range. However, I'm confident this product holds significant value for me.  I'm prepared to offer $800000. This reflects a reasonable compromise, and I believe we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm starting to think you're getting close to the sweet spot. I'm willing to meet you at $1100000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. This is my final concession, so I hope we can wrap up the deal here.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair deal, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $1100000 is still a bit beyond my limit. To finalize this deal, I'm prepared to offer a final price of $950000. This reflects a significant investment on my part and allows us to both walk away satisfied.  Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my minimum acceptable price.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. While I'm very interested in this product, $1050000 is still a bit beyond my budget.
