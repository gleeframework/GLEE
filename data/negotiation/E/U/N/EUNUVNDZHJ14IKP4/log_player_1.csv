Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for this offer. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations slightly above your desired price, leaving room for potential concessions.
* **Targeting Bob's Value:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves a potential $300,000 profit for Bob (if he were to use it himself or find another buyer). This makes the deal attractive compared to his alternative.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a strong backup plan with John, ensuring you won't be forced to go below your minimum price.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation process."
