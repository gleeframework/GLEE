"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Could you consider a price like that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $16000? This is a fair price considering the value you'll be getting from this product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $14000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on that.  Let's settle on $14500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your point, but $14500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13500. Can we meet at that price?",13500.0,Bob,6,
