"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it's worth well over a million to you.  To make this a swift and mutually beneficial deal, I propose a starting price of $1,150,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong opening:** Starting with a confident message emphasizing the product's value sets a positive tone.
* **Ambitious but justifiable price:** $1,150,000 is a strong starting point, aiming for a near-even split of the perceived value between you ($1,000,000) and Bob ($1,200,000).
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This initial offer acknowledges there's room for negotiation while still aiming high.
* **Seeking Bob's input:** Ending with ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on this product, I believe we can find a price that better aligns with both our interests. Considering the market and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above your minimum, it's still a significant distance from your target and his perceived value.  It makes sense to negotiate further, especially since you have ample rounds left.  You are confident you can bridge the gap and secure a better deal than John's guaranteed offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. However,  $1,050,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  Let's find a middle ground: How about we agree on $1,120,000? This reflects the significant value it brings while acknowledging your initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and validate:** Recognizing Bob's counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving smoothly.
* **Reiterate value:**  Subtly remind Bob of the product's worth to justify a higher price.
* **Strategic concession:**  Moving down to $1,120,000 shows willingness to compromise but remains firm on securing a favorable deal.
* **Seeking common ground:** Framing the counteroffer as ""finding a middle ground"" encourages collaboration."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I understand the value you see in this product, but given my current financial situation, I must respectfully decline. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,080,000. I hope this revised figure will be more in line with what you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. You're still early in the negotiation process, and his latest offer is getting closer to your minimum acceptable price. It's worth pushing a bit further to see if you can secure a better deal than John's $1,000,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair price considering the unique value this product offers.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time for a firmer approach:** By Round 5, it's strategic to increase the pressure slightly. 
* **""Final offer"" tactic:** Introducing the ""final offer"" element can prompt Bob to take your offer more seriously.
* **Justified price:** Emphasizing fairness and the product's unique value reinforces the offer's strength. 
* **Still above the alternative:** $1,100,000 remains a significantly better outcome than selling to John. 
* **Gauge Bob's seriousness:** This tactic helps determine if Bob is truly willing to meet closer to your target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your offer, but after careful consideration, I believe we can reach a more equitable solution. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,070,000. I hope this revised figure will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Diminishing returns:** While you could likely negotiate a bit more, the gains are becoming smaller with each round. Bob is unlikely to suddenly jump to a much higher figure.
* **Risk vs. reward:** Continuing to push aggressively risks alienating Bob and losing the deal altogether. Accepting now secures a $70,000 profit over John's offer. 
* **Time value of money:**  Closing the deal sooner allows you to deploy the capital into other ventures or investments. 

While ideally, you'd get closer to your initial target, accepting $1,070,000 represents a solid profit and a successful negotiation outcome."
