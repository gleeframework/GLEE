"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is close to his limit, there's still room to negotiate. It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer.  He's aiming for a price point that's still attractive to Alice, considering she values the product at $12,000, but also offers a substantial discount for himself.  This first counteroffer is designed to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially set the stage for further compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still a bit higher than Bob's ideal.  Since there are still rounds left, it makes sense to continue negotiating to see if he can secure a price closer to his target of $10,000.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further, or Bob might be able to make a more compelling counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob continues to push for a lower price.  He's raised his counteroffer slightly from the previous round, but still remaining below his maximum limit. This gradual approach shows Alice that he's serious about getting a good deal while staying within his budget.  This round aims to see if Alice is willing to accept a price closer to Bob's ideal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,600 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant reduction from her initial price.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and the potential for a prolonged process outweighs the potential gain of an additional $600.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price he's comfortable with and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
