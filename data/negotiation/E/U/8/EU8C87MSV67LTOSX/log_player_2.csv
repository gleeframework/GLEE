Alice's offer:

How about we settle on $1,000,000? I believe this reflects the value it offers while acknowledging your budget.

Alice's offer is still too high, but closer to my budget. I will counteroffer again."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $925,000 is still too low for me.  How about we make it $975,000?  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a significant compromise on my part.

Alice's final offer is still higher than my preferred price point. While I could continue to negotiate, I'm concerned that we might not reach an agreement.  It's better to be safe than sorry, so I'll go with the guaranteed price from John."
