"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds. What do you say?

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You are looking to save as much money as possible, and $1,000,000 is well above your maximum price.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $950,000 is still above my target price. It's better to continue negotiating and see if we can get closer to my budget.  I'm willing to pay up to $800,000, and I believe there's room for compromise."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit too steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair compromise given our positions.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price if we continue to work together."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Alice is getting closer to my target price, but $925,000 is still above my budget. I want to see if we can close the deal closer to my $800,000 limit.  There are still a few rounds left, and I believe there's room for a more favorable offer."
