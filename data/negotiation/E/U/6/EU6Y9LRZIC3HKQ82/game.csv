"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. Let's compromise: I'm willing to lower the price to $9,000.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8,800?",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,800 just isn't going to work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,200? This would be a great price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",9200.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I'm still not quite there. Would you be willing to go down to $8,500 again?",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles here.  $8,500 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we split the difference one last time and settle on $9,000? I'm not willing to go lower than that, so this is my final offer.",9000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go lower than $9,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and my previous offer of $8,500. How about we settle on $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm going to be upfront - this is my final offer.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900, but I won't go any lower. This is a fair price for both of us.  If you're serious about buying the product, I urge you to take this offer.",8900.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,900 and $8,500. How about we settle on $8,700?",8700.0,Bob,10,
