"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I want to try and get a better price from Bob before selling to John.  $8,500 is still significantly less than what the product is worth to him, so I believe I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. Let's compromise: I'm willing to lower the price to $9,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $8,800 is still below my minimum threshold of $8,000, and I think I can get closer to my desired price. I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,800 just isn't going to work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,200? This would be a great price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 9200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still not there yet.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to try and get a better price before resorting to selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles here.  $8,500 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we split the difference one last time and settle on $9,000? I'm not willing to go lower than that, so this is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're not willing to go lower than $9,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and my previous offer of $8,500. How about we settle on $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $8,750 is getting close to my minimum threshold, I'm still not there yet. I'm not willing to sell to John yet, because I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob. I'm going to make a final counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm going to be upfront - this is my final offer.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900, but I won't go any lower. This is a fair price for both of us.  If you're serious about buying the product, I urge you to take this offer."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,900 and $8,500. How about we settle on $8,700? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700.

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is the last round, and Bob's offer of $8,700 is still below my minimum threshold of $8,000. While I would prefer to get a higher price, I'm not willing to risk losing the deal completely.  It's better to secure the sale with John at $8,000 than to continue negotiating with Bob and risk ending up with nothing."
