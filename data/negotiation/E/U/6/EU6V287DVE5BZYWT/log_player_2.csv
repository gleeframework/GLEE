Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but let's meet in the middle at $950000. This represents a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a solid starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
