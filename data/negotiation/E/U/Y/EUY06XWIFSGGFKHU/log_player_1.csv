"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm offering it to you for $110."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$110:** This price is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, but it's still within a reasonable range for a first offer.  
* **Message:** The message is friendly and introduces the product, aiming to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start with a price slightly higher than Bob's value, hoping he'll be willing to negotiate. I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $100 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $90. I understand if this is not possible, but I thought I'd give it a try. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While $90 is a better price than my initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I've already established a starting point, and I'm prepared to make further concessions if necessary. Selling to John for $100 is a good backup option, but I believe I can get closer to my target price by continuing the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $100. I'll need to consider how much flexibility I'm willing to offer while still remaining profitable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm proposing $95, which is halfway between my initial offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $90. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and shows I'm taking his offer seriously. 
* **Emphasizing fairness:** My message highlights that $95 is a fair price for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of equity and potentially making him more receptive to my offer. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and encourages Bob to move closer to my desired price point.  I'm still open to further negotiation, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob remains too far below my target price."
