"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. This is a great deal, as it's well below what it's worth to me. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I am looking to keep my spending under $80 if possible. Would you consider lowering the price to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $105?  That's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the reduction. Considering my budget, I would like to propose $100 as the price for the product. I hope this meets in the middle for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. $100 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Would you consider $110?  This is a significant discount from my original asking price and would make this a truly great deal for you.",110.0,Alice,5,
