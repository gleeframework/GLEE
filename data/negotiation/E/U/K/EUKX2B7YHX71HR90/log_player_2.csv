"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

Alice has lowered her price to $90, which is within your budget and a better deal than buying from John. Accepting her offer is the best choice."
