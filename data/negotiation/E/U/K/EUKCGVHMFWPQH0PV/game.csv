"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the item, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. I suggest $500000 for the product.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $500000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to consider a more reasonable offer. I'd like to propose a compromise: $1200000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. However, based on my assessment, I am not willing to pay more than $700000 for the product. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $700000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1100000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise. Based on my assessment, I am willing to pay up to $950000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $950000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'd like to propose a final counteroffer of $1250000. This is my best and final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
