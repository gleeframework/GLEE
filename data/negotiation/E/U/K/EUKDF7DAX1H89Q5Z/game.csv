"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it below its market value. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,050,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,250,000?  This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a good compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. How about $1,212,500?  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",1212500.0,Alice,5,
