"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Starting with a significantly higher price than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation and potential for a higher profit. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  The initial offer will help me understand Bob's eagerness and flexibility. 
* **Alternative Option:**  The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer provides a safety net and leverage in the negotiation. 
 
This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging the potential risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request. After careful evaluation, I believe we can reach a fair agreement. I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is a substantial amount, it's still significantly lower than my initial ask.  Rejecting this offer allows me to:

* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  Showing I'm not easily swayed by a lower offer keeps the negotiation power balanced.
* **Explore Higher Potential:** There's still room to negotiate a price closer to my target. 
* **Leverage John's Offer:**  The guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John gives me a safety net, making me less likely to settle for a significantly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer and understand your perspective. However, $1,500,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ let's settle at $1,650,000. This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers shows a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  The $1,650,000 price point keeps the deal significantly above both my minimum and John's offer, aiming for a higher profit margin. 
* **Clear Communication:**  The message emphasizes the product's value while directly addressing Bob's offer to maintain a positive negotiation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. I've given this some thought and am willing to consider $1,600,000 as a compromise. I hope this proposal aligns better with your valuation of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a strong deal, and here's why I choose to accept:

* **Significant Profit:**  This price is $600,000 above my minimum and represents a substantial profit.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob's consistent movement towards my price point demonstrates a genuine interest in closing the deal.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation rounds risk creating an impasse and potentially losing Bob as a buyer. It's unlikely he'll go much higher, and I risk leaving money on the table by pushing too hard. 

Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of continuing a negotiation that might not yield significantly better results."
