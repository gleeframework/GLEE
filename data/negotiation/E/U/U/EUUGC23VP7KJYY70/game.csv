"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm open to negotiating the price, but I have to start somewhere. Let's begin with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can see the value this product brings to your business, and I'm willing to compromise. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still above my comfort zone. Given the value I see in this product and my budget, I'm prepared to go up to $1,000,000. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000. I believe this product is worth more to me than that, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
