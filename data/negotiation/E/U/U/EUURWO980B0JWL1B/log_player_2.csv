"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial value of $10,000, it's still above Bob's maximum of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his maximum of $8,000 as possible. Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still potentially attractive to her considering her value of $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still above Bob's maximum of $8,000. While it's closer than before, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. It's worth risking another round of negotiation to potentially get closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to his maximum price.  Offering $8,750 is a slight increase from the previous offer, showing willingness to compromise but still keeping the price below his limit. This can potentially be a more enticing offer for Alice, who has already lowered her price once."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,800 is just $800 above Bob's maximum price of $8,000. This is a significant concession from Alice and likely close to her minimum price. Continuing the negotiation might yield a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away and Bob having to pay John $8,000 outweighs the potential small savings.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice to ensure Bob gets the product at a good price."
