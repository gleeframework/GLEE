Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below what I believe is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price reflects the value we both recognize in the product, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on. Let's work together to finalize this transaction.
