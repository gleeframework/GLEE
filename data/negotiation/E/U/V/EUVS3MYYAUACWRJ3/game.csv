"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a rare opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1,500,000 is way outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. This is a fair offer considering my maximum budget and the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,500,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges your budget constraints.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as it's the maximum I can spend. If it's not acceptable, I'll have to look elsewhere.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
