"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's much closer to her value than to mine. I'm willing to negotiate to see if I can get a better price, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as my backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a low offer ($60) to signal that Alice's initial price is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This lowball offer leaves plenty of room for negotiation. I expect Alice to counter, and I'm prepared to increase my offer gradually.
* **Polite and Interested:** I'm keeping the tone polite and expressing continued interest in the product to encourage Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress, But Not Enough:** Alice coming down to $90 is a good sign, but it's still above my ideal price and my maximum budget. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation, and I think Alice might be willing to go lower, especially as we are getting closer to my limit. 
* **John's Offer:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option, especially if Alice doesn't move closer to my price range in the next round or two."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. $90 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. How about $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I'm increasing my offer to $75, showing Alice I'm willing to move closer to her price.
* **Targeting My Range:** This offer is still within a comfortable range below my $80 maximum, leaving a little room for a final compromise.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help gauge how much lower Alice is willing to go. If she rejects it outright, I know I might need to consider John's offer more seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $85. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** At $85, Alice's offer is just slightly above my ideal price, but it's still within my $80 budget.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might save me a few dollars, but there's a risk that Alice won't go any lower or that we'll reach an impasse. It's not worth risking the deal for a small potential saving.
* **Time Factor:** We've already gone through several rounds, and I'd rather secure the deal now than drag it out further."
