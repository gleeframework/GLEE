"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to offer you the product for $800,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Given the value of the product to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to pay $700,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway.
