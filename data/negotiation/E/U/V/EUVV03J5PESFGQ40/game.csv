"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $1000000 right now.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1300000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $1300000 is still a bit too high. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1150000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous counteroffer. How about we try $1225000?",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1225000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is my absolute limit.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
