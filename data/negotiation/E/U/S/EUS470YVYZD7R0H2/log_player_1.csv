"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1450000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still below Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I want to try to get closer to my desired price of $1,450,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,400,000, but still well above Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm hoping to get a better price by continuing to negotiate with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but only to $1,350,000. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to Bob. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to him and lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Even though it's not my ideal price, it's getting close and I'm worried that if I reject his offer, he might walk away completely.  I'm going to accept his offer to secure a sale."
