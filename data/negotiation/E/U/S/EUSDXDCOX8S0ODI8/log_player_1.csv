Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,500 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Confident but not Greedy:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value without seeming overly aggressive. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob before considering the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
