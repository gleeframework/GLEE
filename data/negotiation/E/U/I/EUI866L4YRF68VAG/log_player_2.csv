Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $18,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to accept.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $13,500 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering $16,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stuck around a price that's too high. She went up to $16,000, which indicates she's not budging much. It's unlikely she'll go down to a price I'm willing to pay within the remaining rounds.  It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John for $10,000 and avoid the risk of overpaying."
