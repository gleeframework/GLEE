"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000. I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's better to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price. You can still buy from John if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,375,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,375,000 is within your budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000.  It's also closer to your desired price point.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will reject further counteroffers, leaving you with no choice but to buy from John.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
