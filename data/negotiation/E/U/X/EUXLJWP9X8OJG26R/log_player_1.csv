Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have leverage to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** $15,000 is a significant increase from your minimum, but not so high as to be immediately off-putting. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message subtly highlights the product's ""unique value,"" subtly justifying the higher price. 
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning a public listing creates a sense of urgency for Bob to decide.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's response and your negotiation skills, you might adjust your price. However, always keep your $10,000 safety net with John in mind."
