"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable offer given the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $1,200,000 is far too high for his budget. It's important to establish a negotiation starting point that is within his range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product,  which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, while also considering your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price point.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's aim for a win-win scenario."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $950,000 is closer to his budget, he can still potentially get a better deal. He's already stated his firm offer and can continue to negotiate. There's still time to potentially get a lower price from Alice before he decides to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to reach your target price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $900,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's final offer is $1,100,000, which is still above Bob's budget.  John offers a price of $800,000 which is within Bob's budget and the best possible price for him.  While there's still a chance to negotiate further with Alice, it's getting late in the game, and the risk of Alice refusing a counteroffer and losing a deal with John is too high."
