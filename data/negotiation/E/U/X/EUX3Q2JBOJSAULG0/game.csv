"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable offer given the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product,  which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This price still reflects the product's value to me, while also considering your budget constraints.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's aim for a win-win scenario.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value it holds for you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to reach your target price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can close the deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but $900,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value it holds for you.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
