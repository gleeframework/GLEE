"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
