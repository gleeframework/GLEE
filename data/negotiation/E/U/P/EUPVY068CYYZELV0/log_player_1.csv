Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm aiming high to maximize my potential profit. 

I'll be watching Bob's response closely and adjusting my strategy accordingly.  I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum value of $1,200,000.  

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired value with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,500,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still a good profit margin for me.  

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm prepared to walk away if he continues to lowball me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still above my minimum value. While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  I'm going to accept his offer to secure the sale."
