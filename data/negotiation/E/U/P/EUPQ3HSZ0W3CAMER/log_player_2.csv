"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You are willing to pay no more than $120. Alice's offer is too high.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
``` 

You are starting with a lower price than your maximum, to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $100 is a significant discount from her initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is closer to your maximum, but still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth rejecting and seeing if she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

You're getting closer to your maximum price, so you're raising your counteroffer slightly.  This should show Alice that you're serious about buying, but still leaves room for her to make a concession."
