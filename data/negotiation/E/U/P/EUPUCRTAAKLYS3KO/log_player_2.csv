"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for less from Alice or from John.  It makes sense to try and negotiate a better price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  I'm confident this is a price that will benefit both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $9,000 is still within his budget and it's a better price than what John is offering."
