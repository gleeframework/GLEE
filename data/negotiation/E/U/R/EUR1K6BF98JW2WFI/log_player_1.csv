**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently undervaluing the product and only increasing his offers incrementally. It's highly unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering ($1,500,000). Accepting his current offer of $1,600,000 might seem tempting, but the remaining rounds are unlikely to bridge the gap to a much more desirable price. Cutting losses and taking John's guaranteed offer is the most profitable decision at this point."
