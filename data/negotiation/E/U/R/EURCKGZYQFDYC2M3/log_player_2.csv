"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the true value of what's on the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $1,750,000 is still above Bob's budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,750,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is a step in the right direction, we're still a bit apart. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,600,000. I believe this strikes a balance, recognizing the product's value while finding a solution that could work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still above Bob's budget.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  This ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation that may not lead to a successful outcome."
