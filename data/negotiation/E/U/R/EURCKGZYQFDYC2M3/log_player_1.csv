"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations above your desired outcome. This provides room for concessions and makes you appear more flexible later.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,000,000, I'm setting a high anchor point. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it may influence his perception of the product's value and his counteroffers.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm aware that Bob values the product at $1,000,000, and I have a guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 from John. My opening offer leaves space for negotiation while keeping me well above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message focuses on the product's value and potential benefits, emphasizing why it's worth a significant investment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly his valuation of the product, which is lower than both my target price and my safety net (selling to John). It makes sense to counter-offer and negotiate further, aiming to close the gap between our valuations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the true value of what's on the table. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Not Drastic Reduction:** I've reduced my price by $250,000, showing willingness to negotiate but not desperation.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes that my concession is significant and reiterates the product's value.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer keeps me closer to my target price while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,750,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Guarantee:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is better than his previous offer, but it's still below John's guaranteed $1,500,000.
* **Potential for More:** There's likely room for Bob to increase his offer further, especially since we're only in Round 4 of 10.  
* **Negotiating Position:** By rejecting this offer, I signal that I believe the product is worth more, encouraging Bob to potentially meet closer to my price range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is a step in the right direction, we're still a bit apart. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,600,000. I believe this strikes a balance, recognizing the product's value while finding a solution that could work for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm reducing my offer by $150,000, which is a substantial amount but less than Bob's increase. This signals flexibility while still aiming high.
* **Closing the Gap:**  This counteroffer narrows the difference between our positions and encourages Bob to make a similar move towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintaining Strength:** I'm staying above my guaranteed offer from John, showing I'm not desperate to close the deal at any cost. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message reiterates finding a mutually beneficial solution and highlights the value proposition again."
