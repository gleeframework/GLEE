"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the true value of what's on the table. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,750,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is a step in the right direction, we're still a bit apart. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,600,000. I believe this strikes a balance, recognizing the product's value while finding a solution that could work for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
