"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really value.  I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive opening:**  I'm framing the message in a friendly and optimistic way to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Value proposition:** I'm highlighting the potential value to Bob without giving away too much information."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** Bob's offer is still above my minimum selling price of $80.  
* **Negotiation space:** There's still room for a counteroffer to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Potential for higher price:**  I believe I can get a better price than $100 if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $110. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from the previous round.
* **Still above minimum:** $110 is still significantly higher than my minimum of $80.
* **Moderate counteroffer:** I'm not dropping too much, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary. 
* **Encouraging response:** I'm asking for Bob's feedback to keep the conversation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. Considering my budget, I can offer $105 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for improvement:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, there's still room for negotiation to potentially reach $110 or even higher.
* **Value of the product to Bob:** I know the product is worth $150 to Bob, so I believe I can secure a price closer to that.
* **Risk of selling too low:**  Selling at $105 would be a missed opportunity, given the potential for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $105 is still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $107.  It's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 107}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my offer again.
* **Closing the gap:**  This offer is closer to Bob's last offer, making it more likely he'll accept. 
* **Fair price:** I'm presenting $107 as a fair compromise that benefits both of us.
* **Encouraging acceptance:**  I'm emphasizing the price as a ""fair price"" to nudge Bob towards agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to offer $106 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Bob's offer of $106 is very close to my last counteroffer of $107.
* **Time constraint:** With only four rounds remaining, it's crucial to secure a deal before time runs out.
* **Risk of lower offer:** If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will counteroffer with a lower price in the next round.
* **Safeguarding against John:** Accepting this offer ensures a better outcome than selling to John for $80."
