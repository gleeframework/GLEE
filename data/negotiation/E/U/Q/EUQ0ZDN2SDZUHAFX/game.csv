"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable opportunity to acquire a one-of-a-kind product. I'm thinking of a price of $25000 for this exceptional item. Would you like to make an offer or accept this price?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is much higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it.  This is my maximum offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counteroffer with a price of $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's find some common ground. I'm willing to go up to $10000. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $14000, which is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14000 is still out of my range.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10000. This is my absolute maximum, and I hope we can finalize a deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $16000 for the product. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'll meet you at $12500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $12500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11000, but that's my absolute final offer.  If we can't agree on this, I'll need to explore other options.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting too far apart. I'll make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll go down to $13000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,9,
