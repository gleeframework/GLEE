Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,300,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this offer reflects its worth. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting with a price closer to his valuation ($1,300,000) allows room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and emphasizing that the offer reflects the product's worth adds a sense of urgency and value.
* **Backup plan:**  We have a secure offer from John at $800,000, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob rejects the offer.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while being mindful of his potential counter-offers."
