Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum value gives him a good deal while still earning you a significant profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects a great opportunity for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The message is polite, professional, and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob.
* **Price:** $1,150,000 leaves Bob with $50,000 of perceived value, making it likely he'll accept. You earn a profit of $150,000 above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This assumes you don't know Bob's exact maximum willingness to pay.  If you had more information, you could potentially negotiate for an even higher price."
