Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable insight into his level of interest and price sensitivity. If he readily accepts, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects it, you can always negotiate down, knowing your fallback option is John at $10,000. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value, aiming to justify the higher price in Bob's mind."
