"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product and encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to secure a price close to my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) while leaving room for negotiation. 
* This initial offer allows me to assess Bob's interest and potentially gauge his willingness to pay. 
* I'm aware that John is willing to pay my minimum, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but only if it's within my budget. How about we settle at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price, especially since John is willing to pay my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and move to the next round, where I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is significantly below what I need to sell this product.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get. Let's meet in the middle, how about that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've moved down to $10,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price that is closer to my desired outcome.
* **Message:** I'm still being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product. I'm also appealing to Bob's sense of fairness by suggesting a middle ground.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a compromise that allows me to secure a higher price than Bob's initial offer, but still potentially close the deal without needing to rely on John's offer.
* This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
