Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth more to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're already getting $2,000 more than your minimum selling price to John.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob knows the product is worth $12,000 to him, so there's still potential for a higher price. 
* **It shows you're confident:**  By not starting at the highest possible price, you signal you're willing to negotiate but not desperate. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum price to sell to John, it's still below your desired profit margin. You have a good chance of getting a better deal with Bob, so rejecting his offer and continuing negotiations is the better strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is a good choice:

* **It's a compromise:** You're meeting Bob halfway, showing you're willing to negotiate.
* **It's still profitable:** $9,250 is significantly higher than your minimum selling price to John.
* **It maintains pressure:** You're not giving in completely, making it clear you still want a better price than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000 even? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than your minimum selling price to John, and it's likely that further negotiation will result in a price that's closer to your original asking price. It's better to accept this offer and secure a sale rather than risk further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or a rejection from Bob."
