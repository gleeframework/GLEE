Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, you have leverage. It's best to start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A high initial offer allows room for potential negotiation if Bob counter-offers.
* **Maximizing Potential Profit:**  While there's a chance Bob might reject a high offer, the potential profit from him accepting justifies the risk. 

This strategy aims to achieve the highest possible sale price while considering the guaranteed fallback option of selling to John."
