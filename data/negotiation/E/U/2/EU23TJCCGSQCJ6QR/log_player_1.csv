{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering Bob the product for $100. This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **It's below my minimum acceptable price:** I'm still making a profit, even if Bob accepts my initial offer.
* **It's a reasonable offer:**  It's not too high, so Bob may be willing to consider it. 

I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to sell the product now, $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $95 to make this deal work. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $95. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. It's also closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure I can go that high, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $87.50. That's the lowest I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $87.50 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my goal of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try to find a compromise. How about $92.50? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

I'm offering $92.50. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate. It's also closer to my desired price, while still being below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can offer $90, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting late, and Bob is firm at $90.  While that's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  To avoid further negotiations and ensure I get at least my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to sell to John for $120."
