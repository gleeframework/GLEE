"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800000 to you.  I'm sure you can see the value in this.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than what John is offering, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can purchase the product from John for $800,000, saving him $150,000."
