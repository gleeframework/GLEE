"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset for you. It's worth at least $800,000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, given the product's worth, and it allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another potential buyer lined up.",850000.0,Alice,1,
