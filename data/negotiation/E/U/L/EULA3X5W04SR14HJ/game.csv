"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $10500 for it. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to me and your potential gain from the sale.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. Considering your willingness to pay $10500, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $11500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000, which is a good deal for both of us. I believe this price reflects the value of the product to me and allows you to make a profit. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11000 is a bit lower than my initial target, but I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal. Considering your willingness to pay $11000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $11800. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise that reflects the product's value to you.",11800.0,Alice,5,
