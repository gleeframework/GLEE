"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is significant.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. I'm confident this would be a fair deal for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $925,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings.",900000.0,Bob,4,
