"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a valuable asset that can benefit your business significantly. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** Starting with a high price allows for room to negotiate downwards and ultimately achieve a good deal.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's value and potential benefits for Bob can make the offer seem more attractive.
* **Open Communication:** The message encourages Bob to engage in a conversation, potentially revealing his own valuation and interest in the product. 

**Note:**  This is just the initial offer. I will be adapting my strategy based on Bob's responses and the remaining negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking for a more reasonable price. Could we discuss something closer to $800000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While $800,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, it's still very early in the negotiation. There's potential to get a higher price.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation.  This demonstrates my willingness to stand firm and potentially push for a better price.
* **Exploring Options:**  The remaining rounds allow me to gauge Bob's true valuation and potentially find a compromise closer to my initial desired price.

**Next Steps:**  In the next round, I will propose a counteroffer slightly below my initial offer but still above Bob's offer, leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $800,000 is certainly the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe the true value of this product lies closer to my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This price reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from owning this product, and it's still a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise, while still being significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Value Reinforcement:**  The message continues to highlight the product's value and benefits to Bob, reinforcing the rationale behind the proposed price.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  The counteroffer is presented as a ""fair deal"" for both parties, aiming to build trust and encourage Bob to reconsider his position.

**Next Steps:**  I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. If Bob rejects again, I'll likely lower my price slightly in the next round, but will remain firm in my desire to achieve a price closer to my initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the current market conditions and the potential benefits, I believe $850000 would be a fair price for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price ($800,000), but there's still room for improvement.  Selling to John now would be the same price as Bob's offer, and I'm still confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **Negotiation Momentum:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not willing to settle immediately. It maintains my leverage and encourages Bob to come up with a better price.
* **Time Constraint:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to strike a balance between securing a deal and maximizing profit. 

**Next Steps:** In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer closer to Bob's offer, perhaps $875,000. This will signal my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price higher than his current offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. Let's bridge the gap and agree on $875,000. This offer is a reasonable compromise, considering the value of this product and the potential benefits it offers. It's a price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, while still maintaining a price higher than his current offer.
* **Focus on Compromise:**  The message emphasizes the ""reasonable compromise"" aspect of the offer, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Mutual Satisfaction:** The offer is presented as a price that allows both parties to ""walk away satisfied,"" further encouraging Bob to accept the deal. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll closely analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer.  If he rejects, I'll need to consider my remaining rounds and decide if it's better to lower my offer further or accept his offer and finalize the deal.  I'll also consider John's offer as a backup option."
