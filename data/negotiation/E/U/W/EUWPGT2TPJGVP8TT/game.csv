"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $14,500. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",14500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're getting closer to my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm now offering the product to you for $14,250. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",14250.0,Alice,5,
