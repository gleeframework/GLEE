"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Is there any wiggle room?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but  I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,250,000? This would give us both a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $1,200,000? That's the highest I can go.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
