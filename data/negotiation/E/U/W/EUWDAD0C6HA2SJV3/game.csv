"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and still well above my minimum price. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to be responsible with my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to be responsible with your budget, and I appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $950,000?  This still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $925,000. I'm trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm also willing to meet you halfway.",925000.0,Bob,4,
