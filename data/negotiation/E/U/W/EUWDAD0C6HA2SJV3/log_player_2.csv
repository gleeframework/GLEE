"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and still well above my minimum price. Let me know what you think!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to be responsible with your budget, and I appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $950,000?  This still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.
