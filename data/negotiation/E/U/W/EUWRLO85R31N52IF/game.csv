"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope you can make it work.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  If that's not acceptable, I'm going to have to consider buying from John.",9500.0,Bob,4,
