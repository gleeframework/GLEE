"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it.  However, $17,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $14,000 is tempting, I'm hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000. I'm still a bit hesitant at that price.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,500?  I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
