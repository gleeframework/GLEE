"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I've done my research and I believe the product is worth less to me than $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is below its true value. How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is a good price for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower to $1,150,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
