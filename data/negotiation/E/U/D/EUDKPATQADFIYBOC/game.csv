"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll find it's a great compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to meet in the middle. I'll offer the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering its value to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
