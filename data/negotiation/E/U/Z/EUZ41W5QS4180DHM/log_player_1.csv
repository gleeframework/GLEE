This is a good point to accept. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $87.50 is a significant profit margin over your minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away, leaving you with the $80 offer from John. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids further back-and-forth, allowing you to move on to other potential sales.
