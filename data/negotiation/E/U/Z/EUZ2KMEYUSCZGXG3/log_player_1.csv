"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum threshold of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my target.  Selling to John at this point would guarantee me the best outcome, but I want to see if I can secure a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $100 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to go up to $95, but that's my limit. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price point, $95 is still below my minimum of $120. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping he'll budge a little more. Selling to John would be the safer option, but I believe there's still room for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $97.50? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $92.50? That's as high as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $92.50 is still significantly lower than my minimum threshold of $120. We've been going back and forth for a few rounds, and it seems like Bob is not willing to budge much further.  At this point, it's clear that I'm unlikely to get closer to my desired price with Bob.  Selling to John for $120 guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiations with Bob."
