"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $11500? That's the highest I can go.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11500. I'll try to find a sweet spot in the middle. How about $14000? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts to find a sweet spot, but $14000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $12500. That's the lowest I can go.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $12500, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $13250? It's a slight increase, but I think it's a reasonable compromise.",13250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $12000. That's my absolute limit.",12000.0,Bob,8,
