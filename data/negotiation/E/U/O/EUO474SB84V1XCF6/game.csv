"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it has the potential to be very valuable for your business. My initial price is $1,750,000, but I'm open to discussing a fair deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which I believe is a fair compromise given the product's value. Let's see if we can close the deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,350,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on my last offer. How about $1,550,000? This is a significant discount from my initial asking price and a fair compromise given the product's value. I'm confident this price will work for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,550,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a price that works for me.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
