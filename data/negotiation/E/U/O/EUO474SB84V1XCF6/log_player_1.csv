{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it has the potential to be very valuable for your business. My initial price is $1,750,000, but I'm open to discussing a fair deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
  
While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better deal before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which I believe is a fair compromise given the product's value. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While it's tempting to take Bob's offer and secure a sale, I'm still closer to my goal of $1,500,000 with John. I'll counteroffer again and try to close the deal with Bob before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,350,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on my last offer. How about $1,550,000? This is a significant discount from my initial asking price and a fair compromise given the product's value. I'm confident this price will work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,550,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a price that works for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. With only four rounds remaining, I don't have enough time to negotiate further and risk losing John's offer. I'll take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
