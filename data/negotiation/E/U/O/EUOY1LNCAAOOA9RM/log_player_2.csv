"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-quality product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm looking for $150 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $150, and John is offering the product at that price, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice.  You can get the product for the same price from John, eliminating the risk of a drawn-out negotiation."
