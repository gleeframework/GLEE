"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price that's higher than my minimum of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm happy to sell the product to John for $150, I'm not willing to accept Bob's initial offer of $150.  I still have 9 rounds left and there's a possibility I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $175. This is still above my minimum but represents a compromise from my initial offer.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable price and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is getting closer to my desired price. It's above my minimum and I've already rejected a couple of his offers.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for $150."
