Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. How about we try $130? It's still a bit above your original offer, but I think it's a fair price for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to my budget, it seems unlikely she'll go much lower than $130.  At this point, buying from John for $120 is the most financially sound decision."
