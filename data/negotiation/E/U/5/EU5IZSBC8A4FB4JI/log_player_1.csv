Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant profit for me, but still lower than Bob's perceived value. This should encourage him to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to accept such a low offer right away.  I believe I can get a higher price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $10,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but I won't accept a price too far below my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer for $9,500.  This is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than selling to John, and while it's lower than what I initially hoped for, the negotiation process has shown that Bob is unlikely to go higher."
