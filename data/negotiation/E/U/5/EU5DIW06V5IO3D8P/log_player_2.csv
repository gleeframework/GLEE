"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her own valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price, we aim to understand her willingness to negotiate and leave room for bargaining.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counter-offer is still above Alice's valuation of the product ($1,200,000), giving her an incentive to consider it seriously.
* **Alternative in Mind:** We have John's offer of $1,500,000 as a backup plan, so we can afford to be a bit more aggressive in our negotiations with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $1,250,000? That's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Alice lowered her price, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Room for Improvement:**  The new offer is still closer to Alice's valuation than ours. We can likely negotiate further down. 
* **John as Leverage:** We have the option to buy from John for $1,500,000, giving us some leverage to push for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,175,000? I believe that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counter-offer shows Alice that we are willing to negotiate and move closer to her price.  
* **Strategic Increment:** By increasing our offer in a reasonable increment ($75,000), we signal seriousness without giving up too much ground.
* **Time Constraint:** We are conscious that each round brings us closer to potentially having to accept John's offer of $1,500,000. We need to balance negotiation with the risk of missing out on a deal."
