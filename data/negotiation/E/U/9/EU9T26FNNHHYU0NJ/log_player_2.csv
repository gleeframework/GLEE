"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you value highly, for $14,000. I believe this offer represents a significant value for you, given its worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price. Since you're willing to pay John $15,000, there's room to negotiate with Alice. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price."
