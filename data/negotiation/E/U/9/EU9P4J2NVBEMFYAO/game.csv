"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its worth, but I'm also open to negotiation.  Let's discuss a price that works for both of us.  If we can't reach an agreement, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay my asking price.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
