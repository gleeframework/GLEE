"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a slightly better price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if I can get a bit closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still leaves you a significant profit margin, and it's the best I can offer at this time.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While $975,000 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still hesitant.  I'm very close to John's offer of $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum.  I'm going to risk one more counteroffer to see if I can squeeze out a bit more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not quite there with your latest offer. Let's split the difference and settle for $1,012,500. This is a fair compromise, and it ensures we both walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,012,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $997,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $997,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $997,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $997,500 is very close to my minimum, but I've already made several counteroffers and it's clear we're not going to reach an agreement that I'm entirely happy with.  Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially losing out on a sale altogether, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. This ensures I meet my minimum price and avoid any further risk."
