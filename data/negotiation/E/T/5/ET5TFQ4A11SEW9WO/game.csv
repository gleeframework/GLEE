"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is a high-quality item that I believe would greatly benefit you, given its value to you is estimated at $8,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you acknowledging my estimated value, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to buy it for $8,500, which is still a good price for you considering your value. Let's see if we can close the gap.",8500.0,Bob,2,

To further accommodate you, I am now willing to consider $8,800 as the price for the product.
