"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be extremely valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good deal, you can likely get a better price.  Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a lower price.  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,000, which is within my budget and a good price.  It's better than what John is offering, and likely a better price than I could get through further negotiation."
