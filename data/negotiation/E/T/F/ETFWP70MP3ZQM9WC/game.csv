"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. How about we set the product price at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. Let's split the difference - how about $925,000? This ensures a fair deal for both parties, and we can close this quickly.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. However, I would like to propose a price closer to my initial budget. How about setting the product price at $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $875,000 simply won't work for me.  I'm willing to go one last time to $900,000. This reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll be forced to move on to another buyer.  This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,5,
