"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand that $1400000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer. However, I still need to consider my own valuation of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1800000. This price takes into account the value I've placed on the product and still offers you a great deal. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
