,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe it's a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but I'm willing to consider it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $1200000 is a good starting point, I'm still aiming for a bit higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This reflects the true value of this unique product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1275000?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go down to $1300000,  which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. I believe this price fairly reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're committed to getting a good price. While $1250000 is tempting, I'm only comfortable going down to $1280000.  This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges the unique value of the product.",1280000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1280000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $1240000?",1240000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close!  I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I want to make this work. I'm willing to go down to $1260000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a price that fairly reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a profitable deal for both of us.",1260000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to pay $1260000. I'm willing to meet you at $1220000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to walk away and consider buying from John for $1500000.",1220000.0,Bob,10,
