"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $13,000.  This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value of $12,000 as possible, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I won't accept it. I'll try to counteroffer to move closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm offering $11,500. This is still above Bob's perceived value, but closer to my minimum. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and avoid going through too many rounds."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm also aware that I can sell to John for $12,000. I need to find a way to get Bob closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $11,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, but I'm still above my minimum value. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough.  I'll reject it and try to push for a better price in the next round. I'm running out of time, but I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going down to $10,500. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to go much lower.  It's a risky move, but I'm hoping this will be enough to get Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision. While Bob's offer of $10,000 is close to my minimum, I'm running out of time. If I reject his offer, there's a risk I won't be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds. To ensure I meet my minimum, I'll choose to sell to John for $12,000."
