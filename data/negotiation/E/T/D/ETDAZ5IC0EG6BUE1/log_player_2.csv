# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135.

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $100. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the most financially advantageous option."
