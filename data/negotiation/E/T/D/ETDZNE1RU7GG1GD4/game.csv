"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $750,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and it's within your budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $775,000? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit. However, $775,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I hope you'll agree.",800000.0,Alice,5,
