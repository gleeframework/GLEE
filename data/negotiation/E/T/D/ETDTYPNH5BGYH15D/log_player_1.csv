"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm confident it holds immense value for you. To kick things off, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  While I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000,  I start significantly higher than even my own valuation. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a price much closer to my ideal outcome. 
* **Gauging Bob's Response:** This initial offer is designed to understand Bob's negotiation style.  Will he be easily discouraged by a high price, or will he come back with a counter-offer that reveals more about his budget and how badly he wants the product?
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm always aware that I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,200,000. This knowledge gives me a strong position to walk away if Bob's counter-offers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my valuation ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000). Accepting this would be a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still a large gap between our positions, but Bob's willingness to make an offer suggests he's interested in negotiating. Rejecting this offer signals that I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **John as Leverage:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale with John gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob, pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I appreciate your offer, however, $800,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. I'm confident this product can bring significant value to your business, and I'm willing to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ would you consider $1,400,000?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:**  I've decreased my price by $200,000 from my initial offer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate while still staying well above Bob's initial offer and my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:** By reiterating the product's potential value to Bob's business, I'm subtly reminding him of the benefits he stands to gain, encouraging him to see beyond just the price.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  The phrasing ""meet in the middle"" promotes a sense of collaboration and fairness, hopefully encouraging Bob to move closer to my price range in his next counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit. While I agree this product would be valuable, $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget. How about we try $900,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** While Bob increased his offer, the increment is relatively small.  At this pace, it will take many rounds to reach an acceptable agreement.
* **Below Valuation:** $900,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Applying Pressure:** By rejecting this offer, I signal to Bob that I'm serious about my valuation and that he needs to make more significant moves if he wants the product.  

I need to steer the negotiation more aggressively towards my target price range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a more significant move from your side. To be frank, I have other interested buyers. I can let this go for $1,300,000, but this is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm making a smaller concession this round ($100,000) to convey that I'm reaching my limit. 
* **Introducing Urgency:** By mentioning other buyers, I'm introducing a sense of competition and the possibility that Bob might lose out if he doesn't act decisively.
* **Final Offer Tactic:** While I haven't actually exhausted all my negotiating room,  presenting this as a ""final offer"" might encourage Bob to make a more serious counter-offer or accept the deal. 

**Important Considerations:** 

* **Bob's Response:**  I need to be prepared for Bob's reaction. If he doesn't significantly increase his offer in the next round, I'll seriously consider walking away and selling to John.
* **Time Remaining:** I have five rounds left.  I want to avoid dragging out the negotiation to the point where Bob knows I'm desperate to sell before my alternative option disappears."
