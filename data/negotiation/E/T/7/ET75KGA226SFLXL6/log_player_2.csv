"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's below your maximum budget, it's still a significant markup from Alice's own value of $800,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely secure a better price by counteroffering. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  His price is your maximum, so you only want to go that route if negotiations with Alice fail."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the product's value to you, which is $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's a slight reduction from her previous offer, it's still far above her own valuation of $800,000 and closer to your maximum price.
* **There's room for more negotiation.** You've already demonstrated your willingness to compromise, and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate. You can likely find a price that works for both of you.
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.** You don't want to pay his full price unless you absolutely have to."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to give up on getting closer to the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which is a slight adjustment from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and your willingness to pay. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within a reasonable range.** It's a slight compromise from her previous offer, but it's closer to your desired price of $900,000.
* **Further negotiation might be fruitless.** You've already counter-offered multiple times and Alice has shown some resistance. Pushing for a lower price might risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Buying from John is still too expensive.**  Paying $1,500,000 is a significant overpayment, and Alice's offer provides a decent discount.

Accepting the offer at $925,000 is the best option at this stage, balancing a fair price with the risk of losing the deal or having to pay John's higher price."
