"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  Offering $1,200,000 still leaves a significant profit for me, and gives Bob a good starting point for negotiation. 
* **Keeping John in mind:** While I want to maximize my profit, I'm also aware of my fallback option of selling to John for $800,000. This helps me avoid getting too greedy and risking losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $1,100,000 is below my desired minimum of $1,200,000 and significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob.
* **Room for compromise:** There's still room to negotiate. I can likely get a better offer from Bob, especially since I know he values the product higher.
* **Time is on my side:** I have 8 rounds left, and I don't want to rush into a deal that doesn't meet my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer of $1,150,000 is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate while also protecting my own interests. 
* **Staying above my minimum:** This offer still surpasses my minimum desired profit of $800,000, and is closer to my initial offer of $1,200,000.
* **Maintaining pressure:** By not immediately accepting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating my commitment to getting a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $1,075,000 is still below my minimum desired profit and significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob. 
* **Time is on my side:** I still have 6 rounds remaining. This gives me time to continue negotiating for a better price.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob is clearly willing to pay more than $1,075,000. I can likely secure a price closer to my desired $1,150,000 or even higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm narrowing the gap between my last offer and Bob's, indicating flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Maintaining a substantial profit:** $1,125,000 still represents a healthy profit for me while still being significantly less than Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000.
* **Balancing risk and reward:** While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not giving away too much too soon. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price than $1,075,000."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, $1,050,000 is still below my desired profit margin. I'm confident I can get a better price.
* **Limited time:** With only four rounds left, the pressure is increasing. However, I'm willing to risk a few rounds to secure a more favorable deal.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob's consistent counteroffers indicate that he's willing to pay a higher price. I'm hoping to push him closer to my target of $1,125,000 or even higher. 
* **Considering John:** Although I can sell to John for $800,000, I'm not desperate. This gives me leverage in negotiations.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering $1,100,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $1,125,000 and Bob's last offer of $1,050,000.
* **Maintaining a significant profit:**  $1,100,000 still represents a strong profit for me, while still leaving space for Bob to negotiate if he's willing to pay a little more.
* **Time pressure:**  With only three rounds remaining, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to make a decision.  This offer may be close enough for him to accept, or it could push him to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **Considering John:** I'm still aware of my fallback option of selling to John for $800,000, but I believe I can get a better deal with Bob.

I'm confident that this offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and reaching an agreement with Bob within the remaining rounds."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** This offer is a significant compromise from my previous offer of $1,100,000, showing Bob I'm willing to be flexible in this final round.
* **Meeting in the middle:** It's also a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer, creating a potential meeting point for both parties.
* **Time pressure:** With only one round remaining, I need to make a decision that is likely to be accepted. 
* **Risk and reward:** This offer still gives me a profit of $275,000, which is a significant amount. However, it's close to my minimum desired profit, and if Bob rejects, I'll need to consider my options carefully in the final round.

I'm hoping this offer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but if not, I'll be prepared to assess the situation and make the best decision in the final round."

(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is up:** This is the final round, and I've reached my limit. I'm not willing to negotiate further, as I'm running out of time.
* **Unfavorable offer:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still below my desired profit and significantly less than what the product is worth to him. 
* **Protecting my interests:**  While I would prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, I need to secure a sale and make a profit.  Selling to John for $800,000 is a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum profit requirements.

**In this final round, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $800,000. This is the most sensible decision given the circumstances.**"
