Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1800000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given my maximum spending limit. Let's see if we can find common ground.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
