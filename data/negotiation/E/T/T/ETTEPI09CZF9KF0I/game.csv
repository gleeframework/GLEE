"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value of the product for me. ",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need a price that reflects the value this product brings.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,025,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair offer considering we are both trying to find a mutually beneficial solution.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  However, the value of this product is truly above that mark.  I can go as low as $980,000, but that's my final offer.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. However, I still can't go that high. I'm offering $960,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",960000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be firm on this. $975,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. This offer reflects the true value of the product while still acknowledging our negotiation.",975000.0,Alice,7,
