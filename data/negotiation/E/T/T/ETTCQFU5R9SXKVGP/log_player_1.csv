"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.** This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **It tests the waters.**  It allows me to gauge Bob's interest level and whether he's willing to pay a premium. 

If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is far too low. It's below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  I need to try and get a better price. 

I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round where I can make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering $12,000, my minimum acceptable value.  This is a firm offer, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me at this price.  If he doesn't, I'm still comfortable selling to John for this amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not ideal. I'd prefer to get closer to $12,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $11,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still emphasizes the value of the product.  It's a compromise that could be appealing to Bob, especially if he's genuinely interested in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still a bit below my target. I'm not desperate to sell yet, and I'd like to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm making a final concession, offering $10,500. This is a good compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. I hope this will be enough to convince Bob to make a deal. If he rejects this offer, I'm more inclined to sell to John for $12,000 to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a stalemate. Bob's offer of $10,000 is still below my ideal price. I've already made several concessions, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better result. 

It's time to cut my losses and secure the deal with John for $12,000. While it's not my desired outcome, it's still above my minimum acceptable value and ensures I don't waste any more time with Bob."
