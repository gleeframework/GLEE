Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $175. This is a price that is higher than his perceived value, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. I'm aiming for a win-win scenario where I earn more than my minimum goal of $150 and Bob gets the product at a price that is still worthwhile for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is way too low. I won't accept it. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $130. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still more than Bob's offer and closer to my minimum goal. This shows willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not giving the product away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum goal. While I'd prefer more, accepting his offer for $100 is better than selling to John for $150 and still better than taking a loss with his previous offer. This is a good compromise that ensures I still make a profit."
