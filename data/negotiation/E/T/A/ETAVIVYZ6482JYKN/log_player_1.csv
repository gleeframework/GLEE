Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but it allows for some negotiation space.
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and highlighting the value proposition for Bob. I'm also inviting him to engage in the negotiation process. 

**Strategy:**

* **Initial offer:** Starting high gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price.
* **John as a fallback:** Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 provides a safety net and allows me to be more aggressive in negotiations with Bob.
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to counter Bob's offer if necessary, but I'll always keep John's offer in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to achieve.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that's so far below my desired outcome.  

**Reasoning:**

* **John's offer:**  Remember, John is willing to pay $1,000,000. This gives me leverage to hold out for a better price from Bob.
* **Negotiation:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can demonstrate that I'm serious about getting a better deal.  
* **Potential for Compromise:**  Bob's offer shows he's willing to negotiate, and I believe I can find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $850,000 is still below my desired price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, and I'm proposing a price of $875,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing $875,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer but still above Bob's counteroffer.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer while reiterating my desire for a higher price. I'm emphasizing the fairness of my new offer and encouraging further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not conceding too much.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm still above Bob's desired price, reminding him that I have other options (John's offer).
* **Building towards an agreement:**  This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and hopefully lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. However, based on my budget, I am unable to meet you at $875,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $860,000. I hope this suggestion will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $860,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value. While I would prefer to get closer to $900,000, I don't want to risk losing the deal and potentially getting stuck with the product.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:**  $860,000 is only $40,000 away from my minimum acceptable value of $820,000.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a better outcome.
* **John's offer:**  While John's offer of $1,000,000 is tempting, it's important to consider the potential for future business with Bob.  Securing this deal might lead to future opportunities.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice. It's a good deal that meets my minimum requirement and allows for a potential long-term relationship with Bob."
