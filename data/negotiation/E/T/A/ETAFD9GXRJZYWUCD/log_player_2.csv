"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above her value for the product ($800,000) but still significantly below my maximum value ($1,500,000). This means there's room for negotiation. I can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our needs."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $825,000, which is still a good deal for me. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll reject my counteroffer and I'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting Alice's offer saves me a significant amount of money compared to John's price."
