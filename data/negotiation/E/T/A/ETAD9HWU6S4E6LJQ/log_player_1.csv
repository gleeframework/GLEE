Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This gives me a bit of room to negotiate if Bob counters, but it's still above my minimum.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, so I'll accept it. It's better than selling to John for the same price, and I don't want to risk a longer negotiation that might lead to no sale at all."
