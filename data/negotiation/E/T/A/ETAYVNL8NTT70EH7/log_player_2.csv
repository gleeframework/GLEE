"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive deal on this amazing product. I'm willing to let you have it for $12,000. It's a steal at this price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent offer, you know you have a backup option with John at $15,000.  There's room for negotiation with Alice. By rejecting her first offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal, potentially getting closer to your $15,000 maximum budget."
