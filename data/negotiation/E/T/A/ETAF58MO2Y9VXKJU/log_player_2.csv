"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, it's still above his ideal price point of $12,000.  There are still 9 rounds left, so it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  Would you consider $13,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it would be a great price for me."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $13,500. It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my original price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $12,000. While $13,500 is a better deal than the initial offer, he can likely negotiate further. With 7 rounds left, there's still room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $13,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit too high. How about $13,250?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm not willing to go below $13,750. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,750. While this is still slightly higher than Bob's ideal price of $12,000, it is significantly better than the initial offer and getting closer to a fair compromise. It's also important to consider that there are only 5 rounds left and the risk of Alice getting more stubborn or Bob having to buy from John for $15,000. Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible decision at this stage."
