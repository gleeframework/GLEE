Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, and I want to be fair.  $9,000 is my final offer. It's a very competitive price for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down, she's unlikely to reach your target price of $8,000 or less. You've successfully negotiated her down significantly, but it's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
