Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still significantly lower than my minimum ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while still making it a good deal for me.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By starting with a price that's not my absolute minimum, I allow for Bob to counteroffer and potentially arrive at a mutually agreeable price.
* **Being Friendly and Confident:**  A positive tone can encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation and potentially consider a higher price. 
* **The ""John"" Factor:** Having another buyer willing to pay my minimum price is a strong bargaining chip. It allows me to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This price reflects my assessment of the product's worth and my desire to save as much money as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **The Value of John's Offer:**  John is willing to pay my full minimum, which means I have a strong fallback option.
* **Opportunity to Negotiate Further:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range. This gives me the chance to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $1,050,000 but still lower than my minimum. This will allow for further negotiation while keeping my bargaining position strong."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, I'm still committed to getting a fair price for this product. I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it still represents a great value for you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and encourages Bob to do the same.
* **Highlighting the Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and that I'm offering a significant price reduction from my initial offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  This counteroffer is still above Bob's current offer but below my minimum, allowing for further negotiation if needed.
* **Keeping the Door Open:**  I'm keeping the communication positive and open to negotiation, while still showing that I have a solid fallback option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see that you're still firm on your price, Alice. I respect that. My counteroffer is $1,100,000. I believe this price is fair given the current market conditions and the value I perceive in your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is now exactly the same as my initial offer.  This represents a good compromise and a fair meeting point for both of us. 
* **Closing the Deal:** Accepting the offer allows me to secure a sale at a price that is above Bob's initial perception of the product's value and significantly closer to my minimum. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** While John's offer is higher, there's always a risk that the deal with John could fall through. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a reasonable price.

**Conclusion:**

Given the current negotiation, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical decision. It allows me to achieve a profitable sale while minimizing risk and closing the deal."
