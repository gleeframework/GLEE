"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $140. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product. Alice is offering it for $140, which is a better price than John's. However, you can still do better. Rejecting Alice's offer will force her to potentially lower her price to get a sale. If she doesn't, you can still buy from John for $150, which is your maximum."
