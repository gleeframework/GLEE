Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

This offer aims to maximize profit while still considering the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. 

* **$1,500,000** is a significant markup from John's offer of $1,000,000. This reflects the value of the product to you and creates room for negotiation. 
* **The offer is not outrageously high:** If Bob values the product significantly higher than $1,500,000, he's likely to accept.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher profit:** This offer gives you the potential to earn $500,000 more than John's offer. 
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  While there's a risk Bob might reject the offer, the potential reward outweighs the risk. You are guaranteed to make at least $1,000,000 from John if Bob rejects the offer. 

**Note:** This is just an initial offer. You may need to adjust it based on Bob's reaction and any information you gather about his perceived value of the product."
