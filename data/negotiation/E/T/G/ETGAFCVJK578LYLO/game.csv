"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000.",12000.0,Alice,1,,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10000?"
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit higher at $10500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9500. Can you see your way to that?",9500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I understand you're still looking to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I think $9500 is still a bit too low for me. I can do $10000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really love the product."
"I'm getting close to my limit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm starting to think about other options. If we can't come to an agreement, I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay $8000 for the product. I'd rather sell it to you, but I need to think about my next move.",10000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $10000, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. Considering you mentioned you have another interested buyer, I'm willing to meet you at $9250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement",9250.0,Bob,6,,
