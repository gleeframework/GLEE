Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $700,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a very competitive price considering the potential return on investment."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Even though Bob's offer matches John's, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob clearly sees value in the product, aiming for a $200,000 gain himself. There's room to negotiate further and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  While $800,000 is a tempting offer, I believe its value warrants a slightly higher price.  Would you consider $860,000? This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still reflecting the true worth of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 860000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $860,000 is a little too close to my limit for me to be comfortable. How about $825,000? That's a firm offer from my side. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

}
```

Bob has now presented a ""firm offer"" and is getting very close to your backup price with John. Accepting this offer secures a profit above your minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in future rounds."
