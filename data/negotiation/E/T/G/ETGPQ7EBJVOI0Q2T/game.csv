"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $700,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a very competitive price considering the potential return on investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  While $800,000 is a tempting offer, I believe its value warrants a slightly higher price.  Would you consider $860,000? This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still reflecting the true worth of what I'm offering.",860000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $860,000 is a little too close to my limit for me to be comfortable. How about $825,000? That's a firm offer from my side.",825000.0,Bob,6,
