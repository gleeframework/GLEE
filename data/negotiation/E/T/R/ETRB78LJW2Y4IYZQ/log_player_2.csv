"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth the price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $12,000. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer allows him to try and negotiate a lower price again."
