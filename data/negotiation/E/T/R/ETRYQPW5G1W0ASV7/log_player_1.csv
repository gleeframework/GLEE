Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $130 is too low, and I'm confident I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 
I'm going to counter with $175. It's a fair compromise between my original asking price and Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum and avoids the risk of losing the sale to John or continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially getting a lower price."
