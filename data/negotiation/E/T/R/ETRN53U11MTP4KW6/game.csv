"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $2,000,000 is quite steep for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 falls significantly short of what I consider fair value.  To move things along, I'd be willing to come down to $1,750,000. This represents a significant concession on my end while acknowledging the product's worth.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This is a fair offer considering my budget limitations.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
