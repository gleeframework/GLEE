"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by myself. Considering its quality and the benefits it provides, I believe it's worth more than $80 to you. Would you like to make an offer closer to my asking price, say $120? I'm open to negotiation but would appreciate if we could reach a fair agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
