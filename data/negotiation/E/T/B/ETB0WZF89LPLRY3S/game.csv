"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $13500. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far off from what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to compromise and offer $12200. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",12200.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're willing to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $12200. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I think that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",13000.0,Alice,5,
