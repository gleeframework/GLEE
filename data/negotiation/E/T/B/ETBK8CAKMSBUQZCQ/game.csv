"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do  $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
