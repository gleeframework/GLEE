Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential $300,000 surplus to negotiate.
* **One-Shot Deal:** Bob only gets one chance to accept. This gives you some leverage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to capture as much of that $300,000 surplus as possible, but not price so high that Bob walks away.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""confident it will exceed your expectations"" increase the perceived value.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,450,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain, which is still a significant incentive to accept.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $1,450,000. You might want to consider starting a bit lower (e.g., $1,400,000) to increase your chances of closing the deal quickly. However, this strategy aims to maximize your potential profit."
