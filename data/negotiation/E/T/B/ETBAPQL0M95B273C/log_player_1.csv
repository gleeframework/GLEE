{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you.  I'm asking for $9,500 for it, which is a fair price considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum price but leaves room for negotiation. This allows for potential counteroffers without immediately resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price,  it's worth trying to negotiate a higher price.  A counteroffer gives you a chance to see if Bob is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,500? It's a fair price that still gives you a good value for the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I understand the value of the product, but I am still working within a specific budget. Could we perhaps agree on a price of $8,200? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my financial limits while still providing a reasonable return for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer of $8,200 is only $200 less than John's offer and still meets my minimum requirement. It's likely we won't get a better offer from Bob, so accepting his offer is the best choice."
