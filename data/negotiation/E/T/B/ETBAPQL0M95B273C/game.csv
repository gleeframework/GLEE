"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you.  I'm asking for $9,500 for it, which is a fair price considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,500? It's a fair price that still gives you a good value for the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I understand the value of the product, but I am still working within a specific budget. Could we perhaps agree on a price of $8,200? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my financial limits while still providing a reasonable return for you.",8200.0,Bob,4,
