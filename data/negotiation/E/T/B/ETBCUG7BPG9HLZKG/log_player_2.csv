"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason:Alice's offer is too high. I can try to negotiate a lower price that's closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

Reason: I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($600,000) to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This leaves room for me to increase my offer while staying well below John's $800,000 price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I also have to consider my minimum price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason: While Alice came down in price, $900,000 is still above my maximum budget and what John is offering.  I'll try to negotiate a bit further, but I'm getting close to the point where John's offer makes more sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm trying to stay within a tighter budget though. Could you do $750,000?"",
""product_price"": 750000
}
``` 

Reason: I'm increasing my offer, but staying below John's price. This gives Alice a chance to still get a better price than John is offering while also moving closer to a price I'm comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Reason: Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $850,000 exceeds my budget and what John is offering. It's now the most sensible choice to buy from John at $800,000."
