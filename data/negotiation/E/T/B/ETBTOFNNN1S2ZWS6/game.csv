"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  How about we start the negotiations at a round $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $600,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still a ways off from that number. To make this work for me, I'd need to be closer to $700,000. What do you say to $720,000?",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $720,000 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. Let's try $850,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can move forward with the transaction. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting closer.  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm ready to make a deal today. How about we split the difference and settle at $785,000?",785000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $785,000 is still a bit low for me, I'm  willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering $835,000, and I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. We have limited rounds left, and I'm confident this will be a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",835000.0,Alice,7,
