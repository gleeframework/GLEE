Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a price I believe is reasonable considering the product's value to me, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. If he rejects, I can then assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, so I am indifferent between selling to him or John. However, there is no benefit to continuing the negotiation with Bob as I've already reached my minimum price. Selling to John is a faster and simpler option."
