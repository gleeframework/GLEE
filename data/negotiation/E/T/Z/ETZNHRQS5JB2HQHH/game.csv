"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. My initial offer is $1,700,000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but it's more in line with my budget. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  It doesn't reflect the product's true value or the potential return it can bring.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure a fair deal for myself.  How about $1,600,000? This price allows for some negotiation space while still allowing me to make a profit.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,400,000 and $1,600,000. How about $1,520,000? I believe this price is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value and your needs.",1520000.0,Bob,4,
