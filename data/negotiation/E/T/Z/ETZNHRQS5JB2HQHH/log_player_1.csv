Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but it's more in line with my budget. Would you be willing to consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my asking price. I'll counter with a price that's more reasonable while still ensuring a profitable sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  It doesn't reflect the product's true value or the potential return it can bring.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure a fair deal for myself.  How about $1,600,000? This price allows for some negotiation space while still allowing me to make a profit.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,400,000 and $1,600,000. How about $1,520,000? I believe this price is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value and your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,520,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,520,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's slightly lower than my initial asking price, it's still above my minimum acceptable threshold of $1,500,000.  It's also a good compromise that shows Bob's willingness to negotiate."
