"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $700000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $725000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still a bit above $725000, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $730000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think?",730000.0,Alice,5,
