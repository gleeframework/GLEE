"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is way over his budget of $800,000. He has room to negotiate a better price and should try to get closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? "", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $800000. I'm willing to compromise, though. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it brings to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should still reject the offer. While $1,100,000 is closer to his target, he still has room to negotiate and should try to get a better price. He has a backup option of buying from John for $800,000, giving him leverage to continue pushing for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I need to stay within my budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $1,050,000 is getting closer to his budget, it's still above his target. He should continue negotiating to try and get a better price. He's already shown Alice he's serious about buying and has a backup option with John, giving him leverage."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm determined to make this deal work, but I need to stay within my budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,025,000 is closer to his target, he can still try to negotiate a better price. He has only a few rounds left but still has the backup option of buying from John for $800,000.  This gives him leverage to push for a more favorable deal."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,025,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $975,000 for the product. I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product for both of us and will allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $975000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice's offer is still too high, and this is the last round.  It's better to buy from John for $800,000 than to risk not getting the product at all.  This strategy also shows Alice that he's not afraid to walk away if she won't come down on the price, which could be helpful in future negotiations."
