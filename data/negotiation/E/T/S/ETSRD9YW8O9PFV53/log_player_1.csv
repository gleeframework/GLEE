Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you've shown interest in.  I'm asking $10,000 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm not going straight to my minimum value ($12,000) to give Bob the opportunity to negotiate.
* **Staying Above John's Offer:**  $10,000 is still more than what John would pay, allowing me to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and am willing to pay $9,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** I want to maximize my profit.
* **Bob's Offer:** $9,000 is still below my minimum desired value of $12,000. 
* **Counteroffer Potential:** I believe there is still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price. 
* **John's Offer:** While John is a guaranteed sale at $12,000, I'm not yet willing to give up on a potentially higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a good offer, I'm looking for a bit closer to my original asking price.  How about $9,500? Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not completely meeting it. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation flowing. 
* **Staying Above John:** $9,500 is still higher than John's offer, making this a more favorable deal for me if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I would like to stick to my initial budget. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  $8,500 is now below my minimum value of $12,000. Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a higher price.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John's offer is a guaranteed $12,000, which meets my minimum requirement.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take more time, potentially delaying a sale and missing out on the guaranteed value from John.

It's important to consider the opportunity cost of continuing negotiations when a guaranteed sale is available."
