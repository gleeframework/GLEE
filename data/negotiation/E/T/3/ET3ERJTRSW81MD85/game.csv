"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $100. I hope this aligns better with my budget.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 simply doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference and settle on $110? It's still a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $105. This would allow us to reach an agreement within my financial limits.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $112.50. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $110. This would allow us to stay closer to the midpoint while still respecting my budget.",110.0,Bob,6,
