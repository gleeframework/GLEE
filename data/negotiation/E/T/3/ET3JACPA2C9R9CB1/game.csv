"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price, however,  $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I can accept.  To find a middle ground, how about we consider $16,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $16,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. To be frank, $10,000 simply doesn't reflect that. Could you consider something in the range of $14,000? I'm confident this would be a fair deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
