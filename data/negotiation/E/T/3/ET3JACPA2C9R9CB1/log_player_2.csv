Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price, however,  $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I can accept.  To find a middle ground, how about we consider $16,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. To be frank, $10,000 simply doesn't reflect that. Could you consider something in the range of $14,000? I'm confident this would be a fair deal for both of us.
