Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a strategic move to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects this offer, it gives me valuable information about his perceived value of the product and allows me to adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I also value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I would like to get more, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially losing out on a guaranteed sale. John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I will sell the product to him."
