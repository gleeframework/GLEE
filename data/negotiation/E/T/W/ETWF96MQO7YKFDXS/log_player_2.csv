"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to make a deal for the right price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below her own valuation, it's still higher than your maximum price and what John is offering. By rejecting this offer, you can move closer to your goal of paying $8,000."
