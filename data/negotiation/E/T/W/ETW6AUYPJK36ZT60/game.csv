"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. I've carefully considered its potential for you, and I'm confident it's worth $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to negotiate a price that's mutually beneficial. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000, which allows for a significant return on investment for you while still being a profitable deal for me. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
