{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum but still higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if needed, while also maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but it's closer than his initial valuation.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $85 is a bit lower than I'd like to go, I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering the value of the product and staying within my budget, I would like to propose a price of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer of $90 is within my acceptable range and closer to my minimum than my previous counteroffer.  It's a good compromise, and I'm happy to accept it."
