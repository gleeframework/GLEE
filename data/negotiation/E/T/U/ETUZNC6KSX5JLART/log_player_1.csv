Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and represents a significant return on investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit above your $1,200,000 minimum. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant return on investment"" to justify the high price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly higher to allow more room to bargain. 
* **Market Factors:** Are there other products similar to yours that Bob could consider? Market competition could influence your pricing strategy."
