Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  $10,500 is too low for me."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would still be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $10,750 is a good price for me, and it's better than selling to John for $10,000.  I'm happy to close the deal."
