Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($15,000). This gives Bob some room to negotiate but still ensures I'm making a profit.
* **Strategic messaging:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob and highlighting the potential for a good deal. 
* **Flexibility:**  If Bob rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his counteroffer, keeping in mind that I have a fallback option of selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $12,000 for it. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between these prices? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value.**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000, even though I'm motivated to sell. 
* **Selling to John is a secure option.**  John's offer guarantees my minimum desired profit. 
* **Negotiation potential:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a higher price.  I'll try to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still confident in the value of this product and its potential benefit to you.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer a slightly lower price of $13,000. This would be a fair compromise and a good investment for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from my initial offer. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm still emphasizing the product's value and potential benefits to Bob. 
* **Middle ground:**  $13,000 is a reasonable middle ground between my minimum acceptable value and Bob's offer. 
* **Openness to negotiation:**  I'm using language that suggests I'm open to further discussion if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. Based on my assessment, I believe I can reach an agreement at $12,500. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value.** I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000.
* **Selling to John guarantees my minimum desired profit.**  He is willing to pay my target price. 
* **Time is a factor:**  While further negotiation is possible, it's unlikely Bob will increase his offer significantly. Selling to John is the quickest and most secure way to achieve my goal."
