,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $140 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $125 for it.  What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, how about $135? Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit more than I can afford. How about $130? I'm really interested in the product and think this price would be fair for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep talking, but I'm really not comfortable going below $132. This is a fantastic product, and I'm sure you'll agree it's worth the price. Let's try to find a middle ground.",132.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $132 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $131, which would allow me to purchase the product without going over budget. This is my final offer. What do you say?",131.0,Bob,6,
