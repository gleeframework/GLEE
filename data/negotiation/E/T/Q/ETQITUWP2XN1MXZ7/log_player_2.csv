"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $140 is still above his maximum budget of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $140 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $125 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, but it's still within a reasonable range considering his budget and Alice's potential profit margin.  This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while also setting a clear price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, how about $135? Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum price point of $120.  He's still hoping to negotiate a lower price and is willing to risk another round of negotiation.  If he can't get the price down further, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit more than I can afford. How about $130? I'm really interested in the product and think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a small concession from his previous offer, but he's still trying to stay within his maximum budget. He's highlighting his interest in the product to encourage Alice to agree to a price closer to his target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep talking, but I'm really not comfortable going below $132. This is a fantastic product, and I'm sure you'll agree it's worth the price. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $132 is getting closer to Bob's budget, he's still determined to try and negotiate a lower price.  He's only two rounds away from being able to buy from John at a lower price, so he's willing to risk one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $132 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $131, which would allow me to purchase the product without going over budget. This is my final offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 131}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push to get the price down.  He's showing that he's serious about buying the product, but he's also making it clear that he won't go any higher.  This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept the offer or risk losing the sale entirely.  Since Bob can buy the product from John for $120, he's willing to walk away if Alice doesn't agree to this price."
