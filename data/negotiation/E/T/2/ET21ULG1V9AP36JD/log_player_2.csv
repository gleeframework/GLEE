(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth buying from Alice for $9,000 when you can get the same product from John for $8,000. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a 12.5% discount. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal, while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is closer to my target, but I'm still not willing to pay more than $8,000. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7800}

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise but still want a good price.  This offer is closer to her previous offer, signaling a willingness to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is now within my budget and closer to what I want to pay. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for $8,000 is too high. It's a good compromise to accept this offer."
