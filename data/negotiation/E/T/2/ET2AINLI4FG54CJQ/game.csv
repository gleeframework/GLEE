"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value while also staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's true worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring this valuable item. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're serious about acquiring the product, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this point.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a very fair price given the value of the product and my financial constraints. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
