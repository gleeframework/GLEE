"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is well above my maximum budget of $800,000. It's important to negotiate and see if we can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.

Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's true worth.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high for me. While she's showing some willingness to negotiate, it's still above my budget.  I will continue to counteroffer and try to get closer to my target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring this valuable item. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're serious about acquiring the product, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'm getting closer to my limit. If we can't reach an agreement in the next few rounds, I might have to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a very fair price given the value of the product and my financial constraints. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to work with me, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still too high for me. We've been negotiating for a while, and it's clear that we are not going to be able to agree on a price that works for both of us.  At this point, I'm better off buying the product from John at $800,000.  This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation that might not lead to a positive outcome."
