"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I can't accept such a low price. Considering the product's true value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my target. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm now offering it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
