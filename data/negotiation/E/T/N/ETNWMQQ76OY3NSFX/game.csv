"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a good price. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $980,000. That's a fair price that would allow both of us to make a profit.  What do you think?",980000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $980,000 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the product's true value. I can offer you the product for $1,020,000. This is a fair price that should meet both of our needs. What do you think?",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I appreciate your continued willingness to compromise. I'm going to meet you halfway on this one and offer $1,000,000. That's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the product's true value. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a fair price that should meet both of our needs. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
