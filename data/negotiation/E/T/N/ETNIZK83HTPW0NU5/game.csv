"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own a truly exceptional item. I'm thinking of a price of $900000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $900000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. This price reflects the product's unique features and the value it can bring to the right buyer. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's unique features, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $775000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $825000. This price still reflects the product's value and uniqueness, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $825000 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $795000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price?",795000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about the product, Bob, and I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to meet you at $810000, which is right in the middle of our previous offers. What do you think?",810000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $810000. I'm willing to go up to $805000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price?",805000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see you're close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $815000, which is just $5000 more than my previous offer. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",815000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I've already gone as high as I'm willing to go. I'm going to have to pass on this deal and look elsewhere. I'm willing to walk away from the table if we can't come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,10,
