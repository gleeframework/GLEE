"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is far too low for me, and I'm still confident that I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $10,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves me with a profit margin. I believe this price is fair and might be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $9,500 is still below my minimum, it's getting closer. I'm worried that if I keep rejecting offers, he'll walk away, and I'll be forced to sell to John at my minimum price. This offer at least provides a small profit, and saves me from the risk of losing the deal entirely."
