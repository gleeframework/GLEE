"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $105. Let's see if we can make this work.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm sure you'll find this product to be worth every penny.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference again - I'll offer you $107.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $107.50 is still too low for me.  I'm confident this product is worth $112.50 to you, and it's a price that works for me. Let's make a deal.",112.5,Alice,5,
