Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is higher than your minimum of $10,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $14,000 is less than Bob's perceived value of $15,000, giving him incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's space to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, allowing you to potentially get closer to his value.

Remember, if Bob rejects your offer, you can always counteroffer or sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is still a good deal for you, it's worth trying to push for a higher price.  Bob has shown he's willing to pay more than your minimum, so you have room to negotiate.  You'll likely be able to get a price closer to your initial $14,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is still a decent profit, it's getting closer to your minimum, and Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate.  A counteroffer will hopefully push him closer to your target price, and even if it doesn't, you can always accept his offer or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. However, $11,500 is just below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call.  You're close to your minimum and Bob is digging in.  At this point, the potential for further negotiation with Bob is very slim.  Selling to John guarantees you $10,000, which is your minimum and secures a sale without any further risk of Bob declining your offer.  While it's less than you hoped for, it's the most sensible move given the current situation."
