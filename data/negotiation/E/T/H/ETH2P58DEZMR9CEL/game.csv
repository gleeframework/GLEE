"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is beyond my budget. I'm very interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and then some.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's within my budget. I'm hoping we can reach a deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
