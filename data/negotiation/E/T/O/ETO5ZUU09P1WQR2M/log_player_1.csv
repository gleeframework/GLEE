Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $110 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $112.50? "", ""product_price"": 112.50}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $105 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  With only 4 rounds remaining, I'm not confident I can get a higher price from Bob.  It's better to sell to John at this point and secure a guaranteed profit."
