Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but not too high to scare Bob off right away. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $100 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's so far below what I'm willing to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering $130. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer of $150 but still higher than Bob's offer of $100. I'm hoping this shows good faith while still remaining profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum value of $120. While I'm open to negotiation, it seems like we're stuck in a stalemate.  John is offering a guaranteed $120, which is a safer and more profitable option for me at this point."
