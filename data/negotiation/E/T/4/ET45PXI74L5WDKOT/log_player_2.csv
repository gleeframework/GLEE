# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice since you can get a better price. You can still go with John if you can't reach a favorable deal with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. Considering the product's true value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your budget and the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

While $1,350,000 is closer to your budget, there's still room for negotiation. You can try to counteroffer again and see if you can get a lower price.  You're still closer to your desired price than what John is offering, so it makes sense to continue negotiating."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. Considering the product's true value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to offer you a slight adjustment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,325,000. This is a final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair compromise.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for Bob. Alice has come down to a price that is just above Bob's maximum budget, and it's still a better price than what John is offering.  Since Alice has indicated it's her final offer, it's likely that further negotiation won't lead to a significantly lower price.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
