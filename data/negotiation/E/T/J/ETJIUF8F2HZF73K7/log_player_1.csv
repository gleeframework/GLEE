Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You don't actually know how much Bob values the product.  Assuming he'd pay $10,000 doesn't mean that's his upper limit. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a price of $19,000, you're ""anchoring"" the negotiation higher. Even if Bob negotiates down, it's likely to be from a higher starting point than if you offered a lower price initially. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $19,000 offer leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer and feel like he's getting a deal, while still ensuring you're well above your minimum price.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000.  There's no risk of not selling the product.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with some negotiation and the potential for Bob to decline your initial offer."
