""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. As you know, it holds significant value, and I believe it could benefit you greatly. Considering its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, Bob's higher perceived value allows you to aim for more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $1,400,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.
* **First Right of Refusal:** By offering it to Bob first at this attractive price, you increase the likelihood of a quicker sale at a higher profit margin."
