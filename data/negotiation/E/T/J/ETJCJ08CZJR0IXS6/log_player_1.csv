Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay a price closer to your minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your minimum acceptable price ($119) creates a sense of urgency and a perceived ""deal"" for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this offer is your first move, it doesn't eliminate the possibility of Bob negotiating down slightly, still potentially landing you a better profit than $120."
