"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,350,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit high for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  This price reflects the product's market value and leaves room for both of us to make a profitable deal. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This offer reflects a more accurate assessment of its worth.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000.  This price represents a fair compromise and allows us both to move forward with the deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
