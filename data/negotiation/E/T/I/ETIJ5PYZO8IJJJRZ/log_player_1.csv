Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob. 
* **Starting High:** A starting price of $15,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value to justify the higher price without revealing your absolute bottom line.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You can always lower your asking price, but you can't go higher once an offer is made."
