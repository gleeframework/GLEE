"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $110 for it. This is a special offer considering its worth to you is $120. I look forward to hearing your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $110 is less than your maximum budget of $120, there's room for negotiation. You know you can get the product for $120 from John. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you might be able to encourage her to propose a lower price, getting you a better deal."
