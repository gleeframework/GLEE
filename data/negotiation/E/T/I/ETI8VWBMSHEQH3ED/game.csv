,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $75 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85? This is a fair price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with your purchase.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $85 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $85, which would be $82.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",82.5,Bob,4,
