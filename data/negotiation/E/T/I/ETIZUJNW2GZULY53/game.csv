,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,350,000 to make this work. This price still leaves a significant amount of profit for you. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $1,350,000 is a better offer, but I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. Can you consider this price?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
