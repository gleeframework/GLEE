"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own a valuable asset that will bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree this product has value,  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product.  I think that's a fair price and reflects its true value. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about the product's value. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is still a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
