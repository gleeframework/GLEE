"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth at least $800,000 to you. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to go above $800,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, as it's what the product is worth to me. Let's see if we can agree on that.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $850,000? That's still a great price for you, considering the product's value, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $825,000. This gives us both a fair deal and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",825000.0,Bob,4,
