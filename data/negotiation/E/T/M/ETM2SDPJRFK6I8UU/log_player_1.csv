{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth at least $800,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, leaving room for potential compromise. I've chosen a price that's within the range of what the product is worth to both of us, but still allows for a profitable sale for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to go above $800,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, as it's what the product is worth to me. Let's see if we can agree on that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is a fair price for the product, it's still below my desired minimum profit margin.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to attempt to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $850,000? That's still a great price for you, considering the product's value, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's position while still seeking a higher price. The $850,000 price is a reasonable middle ground,  potentially enticing Bob to accept without further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $825,000. This gives us both a fair deal and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $825,000 is close to my minimum threshold. It's a reasonable compromise and allows me to make a profit while avoiding further negotiation.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer or me losing the sale to John."
