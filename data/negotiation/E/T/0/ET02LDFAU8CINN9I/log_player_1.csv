"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $8,000, I think I can do better. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
