"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for a lower price than $10,000.  You are aiming for the best deal possible.  Rejecting allows you to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8000 simply doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9000? This would still be a great deal for you considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you can always try to negotiate further, Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and $9,000 is a good deal considering your maximum budget of $12,000.  Accepting avoids the risk of Alice becoming too firm in her negotiations or you ending up having to buy from John at a higher price."
