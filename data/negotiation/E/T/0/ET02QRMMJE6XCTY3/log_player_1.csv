Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's room to negotiate with Bob and potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves a potential profit margin of $300,000 for you. This price is significantly higher than Bob's valuation ($800,000) but still attractive enough compared to your alternative buyer.
* **First-Mover Advantage:** By making the first move, you set the tone for the negotiation. This approach allows you to gauge Bob's interest and adjust your strategy in any follow-up discussions."
