"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I think it's worth $130, but I'm willing to start at $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I want to maximize my profit, so I'm starting with a price slightly above the minimum I'm willing to accept.
* **Being reasonable:** $125 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation without being too aggressive.
* **Adding a personal touch:** ""Fantastic product""  helps build a bit of rapport and makes it feel like a personalized offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I can only do $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, there's still potential for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Selling to John is not ideal:**  While I can sell to John for $120, I prefer to try and get a better deal with Bob.  I still have 8 rounds to negotiate and might be able to reach a price closer to $125."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $115? Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial $125 offer.
* **Finding a middle ground:**  $115 is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer.
* **Staying positive:** ""Let's see if we can find a middle ground"" keeps the negotiation open and friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $105 is the best I can do.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While Bob is showing some movement, $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  He's offering more than his initial $100, so there's a chance he might go higher.
* **Time to counter again:**  I have several rounds left, so I can continue to negotiate and try to get a better price.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  I'm not yet desperate to sell to John, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, but $105 is just a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $110?  That's a fair compromise, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise again:** I'm continuing to be flexible but also trying to inch closer to my desired price. 
* **""Split the difference"" tactic:** This creates a sense of fairness and encourages Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm making it clear that I'm ready to wrap things up and reach an agreement.
* **Keeping it positive:** ""That's a fair compromise"" is a positive statement to keep the negotiation amicable."
