{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential and your specific needs, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You understand the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you significant negotiating power. 
* **Targeting Maximum Profit:** Starting at $1,300,000 aims for a price closer to Bob's perceived value while leaving room for potential negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option:**  You have a safety net with John at $800,000, ensuring you won't be forced to accept anything below your minimum.
* **Justification:** The message frames the offer as mutually beneficial, emphasizing the value Bob will gain rather than focusing solely on the price. 

This strategy balances ambition with realism, aiming to secure the best possible deal from Bob while having a backup plan to avoid losses."
