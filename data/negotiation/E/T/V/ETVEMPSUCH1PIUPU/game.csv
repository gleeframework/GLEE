"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $16,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $16,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I can do $14,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product, and I think this price reflects its value to you.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're firm on the value, but I have a pretty tight budget. How about $13,000? That's a significant step from my last offer, and I'm hoping we can make this work.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $13,000, which would be $13,500. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can see the value in the product.",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is really my final offer. I can do $13,200.  I need to stay within my budget limits, and I think this is a very fair price. If you can't do it, I'll unfortunately have to consider other options.",13200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,200. I can offer you a compromise of $14,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,9,
