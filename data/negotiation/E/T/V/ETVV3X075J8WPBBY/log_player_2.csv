"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows me to benefit while acknowledging its value."",
""product_price"": 500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming to get the price as low as possible. A starting offer significantly below Alice's asking price gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the counteroffer makes it seem more reasonable and less like a random lowball.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  We don't want to offer too close to our maximum price ($800,000) right away. This leaves us room to increase our offer in subsequent rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 is too far below my minimum price.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $700,000. This still gives you a good margin for profit while remaining fair to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:**  While $700,000 is better, it's still above our target price and Alice's counteroffer suggests she's willing to move further down.
* **Alternative Option:**  We have the safety net of John's $800,000 offer, giving us leverage.

Let's see if we can get Alice closer to $600,000 in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, to make this work for me, I need to be closer to $600,000.  Would you consider $620,000 for the product? This offer represents a significant investment from my end while still acknowledging its value to you."",
""product_price"": 620000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** We're incrementally increasing our offer, showing Alice that we're willing to negotiate but holding firm on getting a better price.
* **Target Price:** $620,000 is a good middle ground between our initial offer and Alice's current price.
* **Sense of Urgency (Subtle):**  Mentioning ""significant investment"" subtly implies we have other options, without directly threatening to walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $620,000 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $670,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $670,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $670,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Momentum:**  Alice's counteroffers are getting smaller. We need to show her we're willing to walk away to encourage a more significant concession.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation.  Putting a little time pressure on Alice might push her closer to our target.

We'll hold firm on our $620,000 offer in the next round to see if Alice is serious about meeting in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I have to be mindful of my budget.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $620,000.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal at that amount. However, I also need to consider my other options if we can't find an agreement."",
""product_price"": 620000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:** By repeating our offer, we signal that we're serious about this price point and won't be easily swayed. 
* **Introducing Time Pressure:**  The mention of ""other options"" subtly reminds Alice that we have the John alternative and time is ticking away.
* **Call to Action:**  We're clearly stating our willingness to close the deal at $620,000, putting the decision back in Alice's court."
