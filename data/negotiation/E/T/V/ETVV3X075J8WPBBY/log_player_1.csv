Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows me to benefit while acknowledging its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 is too far below my minimum price.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $700,000. This still gives you a good margin for profit while remaining fair to me."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, to make this work for me, I need to be closer to $600,000.  Would you consider $620,000 for the product? This offer represents a significant investment from my end while still acknowledging its value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $620,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $620,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $620,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still too far below my desired value. I'll reject his offer and counter again.  I need to try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $620,000 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $670,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 670000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I have to be mindful of my budget.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $620,000.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal at that amount. However, I also need to consider my other options if we can't find an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $620,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $620,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to budge much from his offer, and I'm getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds.  While I'd prefer to close a deal with Bob,  I'm running out of time and need to secure the highest possible price.  Selling to John ensures I reach my minimum value and avoids the risk of a lower price with Bob."
