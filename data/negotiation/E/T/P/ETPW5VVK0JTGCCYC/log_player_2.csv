Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,250,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,150,000 is a bit closer to your comfort zone, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my original offer. How about we meet at $1,225,000? This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $1,200,000. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
