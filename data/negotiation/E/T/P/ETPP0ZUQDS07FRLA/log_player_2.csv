"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further.  If not, I'll be selling it to someone else for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is for $120, which is the maximum you're willing to pay. However, she has stated that she's willing to negotiate and will sell to someone else for $100. This indicates she is willing to go lower than $120. You can reject her offer and potentially negotiate a lower price or wait for her to sell to someone else at $100."
