Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's likely that Bob will counteroffer, giving you a chance to reach a price closer to your goal of maximizing your earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is still higher than selling to John, it's not close enough to my desired price. I'll counter with a higher price to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

This counteroffer is a slight compromise from my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's current offer. It signals my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer is now consistent with his previous offer and it's a decent price. It's not as high as I'd hoped, but it's better than selling to John. It's time to accept and finalize the deal."
