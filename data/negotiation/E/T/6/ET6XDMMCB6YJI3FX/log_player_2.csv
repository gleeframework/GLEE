"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. I'm confident you'll find it valuable, but I need to be upfront with you - it's a significant investment. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,500,000 is over his budget, and he can get the same product from John for a lower price.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1200000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,400,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He can still get the product from John for a lower price. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice again to see if he can get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway again, Bob. I can sell the product to you for $1350000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. If you're still interested, let me know. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice's offer is getting closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  Since he has a guaranteed option to buy the product for $1,200,000 from John, it's the most financially responsible choice. There's no guarantee that Alice will continue to negotiate down, and he doesn't want to risk losing out on a better deal."
