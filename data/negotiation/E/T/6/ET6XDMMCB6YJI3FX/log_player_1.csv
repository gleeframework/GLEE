Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go up to $1200000.  Would you be willing to consider that?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I think there's been a mistake! I said I was going to reject Bob's offer and sell the product to John, but I didn't actually do that. I'll correct that now.

However, I'll also send a counteroffer to Bob, since I didn't actually reject his offer.
