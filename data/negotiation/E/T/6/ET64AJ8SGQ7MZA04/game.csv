"Alice,  $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. It's still a good deal for you considering you value it at $8,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $11,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my need to earn a reasonable profit.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
