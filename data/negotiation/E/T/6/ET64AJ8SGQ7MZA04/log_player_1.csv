Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm aiming for a price as close to Bob's perceived value as possible, but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm highlighting the potential benefit for Bob to ensure he sees the offer as attractive.
* **Prepared for negotiation:**  I understand that Bob might counteroffer, and I'm ready to engage in a back-and-forth to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as a backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay $8,000 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. It's still a good deal for you considering you value it at $8,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum.**  I'm not desperate to sell, and I believe I can still get a better price.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob is willing to negotiate, indicating that a mutually agreeable price is within reach.
* **I want to explore further:** I'll counteroffer and see if we can close the gap.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I show him that I'm serious about getting a fair price and haven't given up on the deal. It also allows me to make a counteroffer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $11,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my need to earn a reasonable profit.  Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise that benefits both of us.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable and maintain a good rapport.

By proposing a compromise and emphasizing fairness, I aim to encourage Bob to accept the offer and finalize the deal."
