"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above the product's worth to her ($8,000). This means there's room for negotiation to get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. It's still a good deal for you considering you value it at $8,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $11,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my need to earn a reasonable profit.  Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is a good compromise. It's still within Bob's budget, and it allows Alice to make a reasonable profit.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will get frustrated and walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer ensures a good deal and a quick resolution."
