"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a discounted price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget of $12,000 and also cheaper than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you money."
