Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value. I know Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's room for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter, but I also have the option to sell to John for $15,000, which is my absolute minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd like to get closer to my desired $18,000, accepting his offer guarantees me the least amount of risk and ensures a sale."
