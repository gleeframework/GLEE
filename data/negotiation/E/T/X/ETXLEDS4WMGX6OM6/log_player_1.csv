Bob's offer:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again because it's still too low. While I am open to negotiating, I need to ensure I get a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. I'll continue negotiating with Bob in the hopes of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I acknowledge your desire for a lower price, $1,230,000 is still significantly below my minimum. To continue this negotiation, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offers are consistently too far below my minimum.  I've already conceded a significant amount, and it seems unlikely he will meet my requirements.  To avoid risking further rounds of negotiation with no guaranteed outcome, I'll accept John's offer for $1,500,000."
