Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to try and get the best possible price. I'm also aware that if Bob rejects, I can always sell to John for $100, so I have some leeway in my negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.  I will counteroffer to see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what the product is worth to him, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident that John will buy the product for $100, so I'll sell it to him and avoid further negotiations."
