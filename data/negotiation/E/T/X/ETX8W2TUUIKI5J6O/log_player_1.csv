{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than your minimum:** You're still making a profit.
* **Lower than Bob's maximum:** There's room for negotiation, potentially getting a higher price. 
* **Reasonable:** It gives Bob a good reason to consider buying. 

Let me know what happens with Bob's response! We can then adjust your strategy based on his actions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

It's good that Bob is willing to pay a premium, but $1,100,000 is still below your desired price point.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to counter and potentially get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1125000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can you consider $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still not where you want to be.  You're better off rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate. You've already made concessions, so  you can continue to try and raise the price a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down a little more, to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it allows me to meet my own needs. Let's close this deal and avoid going back and forth any further."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000. This is the highest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below your initial target, it's getting closer to your minimum acceptable price.  You've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation and made several concessions. Continuing to reject and counteroffer could risk losing Bob altogether, and at this point, selling to John would result in a lower profit. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and ensures a decent profit."
