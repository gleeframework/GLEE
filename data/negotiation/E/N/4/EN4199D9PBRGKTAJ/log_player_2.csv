# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. It's a great value considering its worth of $150 to you. Let me know if this works for you!

You can do better than $120.  You're willing to pay up to $150, but Alice is willing to sell for as low as $100.  There's room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $115 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115.

$115 is a good price, closer to your desired price point of $110 and significantly less than buying from John.  You're saving a decent amount of money compared to John's offer."
