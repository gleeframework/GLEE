Alice is getting closer to her minimum, but $95 is still more than I want to pay. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get it lower.  If not, I might just buy from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're close to your minimum, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $91, but that's my final offer.  If you're not willing to go that low, I'm going to have to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 91}
