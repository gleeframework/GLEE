"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price that better suits my budget. I am willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'd like to propose $1,350,000. This reflects the true value of the product while remaining fair for both of us. Let's keep this deal moving forward.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but unfortunately, $1,300,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm happy to continue negotiating, and I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
