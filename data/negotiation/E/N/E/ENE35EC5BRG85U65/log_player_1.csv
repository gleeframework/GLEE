Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is above Bob's perceived value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone in my message to build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Room for Compromise:** $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll be watching Bob's response carefully. If he rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer myself. I'll also keep in mind the possibility of selling to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob stall or become unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$85 is below my minimum acceptable price.** I'm not willing to sell for less than $120, and $85 is significantly lower than that.
* **I have a guaranteed alternative with John.**  Selling to John for $120 is a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** While Bob's initial offer is low, there's potential for a counteroffer that would be more beneficial. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $95? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering $95, which is halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $85. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and reasonable tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Highlight the value of the product:** Reminding Bob of the product's value strengthens my position and justifies the price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be watching Bob's response closely. If he rejects this counteroffer, I'll need to consider my options. If he makes a counteroffer closer to $95, I might be willing to accept. However, if the offers remain significantly apart, I'll need to weigh the risk of selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $90 as the price for the product. It's a fair compromise considering the value I believe it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $90 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While $90 is still a bit lower than I'd prefer, there's a chance Bob could be persuaded to go slightly higher in future rounds.
* **Avoiding the risk of John:** Selling to John for $120 is a safe bet, but there's always a chance we could reach a better price with Bob, especially if he's willing to negotiate further.

**Next Steps:**

If I accept this offer, the negotiation is complete. If I reject it, I'll need to consider carefully whether to make a counteroffer or sell to John. I'll need to weigh the potential for a higher price from Bob against the risk of losing the deal altogether."
