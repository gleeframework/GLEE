"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a fair price considering its value and the benefits it brings. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget. While I think this product has potential, I'm not quite ready to pay $12000.  I'm willing to offer $10000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a price closer to that. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between $10000 and $12000. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,3,
