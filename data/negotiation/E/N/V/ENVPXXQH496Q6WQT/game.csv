"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $90. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $90 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $80. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value.",80.0,Alice,5,
