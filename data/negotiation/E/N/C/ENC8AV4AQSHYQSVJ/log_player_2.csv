"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by myself. Considering its quality and unique features, I believe it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Given its value to me, I am offering it to you at a special price of $120. This is an opportunity to get a high-quality item at a reasonable discount. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $120 is lower than her stated value, it's still significantly higher than your $80 budget and the guaranteed $80 price from John. You can do better by rejecting this offer."
