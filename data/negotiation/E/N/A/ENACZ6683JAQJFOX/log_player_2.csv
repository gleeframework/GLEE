Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're still interested, Bob! I can see you're really wanting this product. I can offer it to you for $139, but that's as low as I can go 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $139.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $139
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is firm on her price, and you've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  It's becoming clear that you won't be able to get the price down to your target.  Given that John is selling the product for $150, which is closer to Alice's lowest offer, it's the better option at this point to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
