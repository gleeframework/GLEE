"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident we can come to an agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $1,200,000 price."
