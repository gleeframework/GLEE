"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,450,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and leaves Bob with a potential profit of $50,000. This should encourage Bob to negotiate rather than rejecting outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my target with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate, but still keeps a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000.  This is a further compromise, but still provides me with a solid profit. I believe this offer is reasonable and might be tempting enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but we've been negotiating for a while, and it seems like he's not willing to budge. I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk losing out on any profit.  It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John."
