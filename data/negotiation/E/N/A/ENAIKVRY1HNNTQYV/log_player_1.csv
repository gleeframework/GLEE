Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a great deal for something of this value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could lead to a quicker sale and still a good profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value of $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if he tries to haggle. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is friendly but emphasizes the value of the product, subtly encouraging Bob to accept the offer.

This approach balances the risk of losing Bob as a buyer with the potential to secure a sale above our minimum acceptable price."
