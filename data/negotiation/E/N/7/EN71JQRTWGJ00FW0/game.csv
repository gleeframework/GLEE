"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $750,000 undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This represents a fair compromise considering its long-term value.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
