"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering my maximum budget and allows us to both benefit from this transaction. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm offering you the product for $1750000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a price that benefits both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to go up to $1400000. This is a fair offer, considering my budget and the value of the product.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. However, $1400000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's close this deal at $1600000. It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1500000. This is my final offer, and it's the maximum I can afford.  I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. Let's close this deal!",1500000.0,Bob,6,
