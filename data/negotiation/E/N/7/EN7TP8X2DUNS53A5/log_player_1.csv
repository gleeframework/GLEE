Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $700,000 is a good starting point, it's not quite where I need to be.  Let's find a middle ground.

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $775,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm confident that we can still reach a deal with Bob, and I'd like to continue negotiating to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.  John is a backup option, but I'm committed to finding the best possible outcome with Bob first."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $810,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's important to close the deal within the remaining rounds. Accepting this offer ensures I meet my minimum goal and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
