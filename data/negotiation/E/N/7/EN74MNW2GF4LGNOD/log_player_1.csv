"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  This gives Bob room to counteroffer, and I'm confident that John's offer of $150 will be my fallback if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's significantly less than my minimum price. While $150 from John is tempting, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price if I continue negotiating with Bob.  I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm reducing my price to my minimum, as Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. This is a reasonable compromise and shows my willingness to negotiate. Hopefully, this will make Bob more likely to accept the offer."
