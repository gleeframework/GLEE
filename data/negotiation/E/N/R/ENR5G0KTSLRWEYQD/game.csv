"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $110 was still a bit too high for you. I'm willing to come down a bit more. I can offer it to you for $105. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
