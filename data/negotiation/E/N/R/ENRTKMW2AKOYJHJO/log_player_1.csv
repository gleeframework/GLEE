"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to tell you about the product I'm selling. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your business.  To kick off our conversation, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts and having a productive discussion."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This gives me room to negotiate and understand Bob's willingness to pay.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting high, I'm ""anchoring"" the negotiation. Even if the price comes down, Bob might be more receptive to a figure closer to $1,600,000 than if I had started at, say, $1,300,000.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  This first offer is as much about getting information as it is about making a sale. Bob's reaction will tell me a lot about his level of interest and his potential budget.
* **Alternative Option (John):** I'm keeping in mind that I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000.  I won't waste too many rounds if it becomes clear that Bob is unwilling to approach a price that's beneficial to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your starting price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle somewhere. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is above my guaranteed sale price with John, it's still significantly below my target. Bob's message indicates he's willing to negotiate and find a ""middle ground.""  This suggests there might be room to increase his offer substantially. I'll counter in the next round to guide the negotiation towards a more favorable outcome."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table with an offer.  It shows you're serious about the product. To be fair, there's a significant gap between your offer and my initial asking price. Let's aim for that middle ground you mentioned. How about we consider $1,450,000? It reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a substantial concession from my initial price ($1,600,000 to $1,450,000) to demonstrate willingness to negotiate. This shows Bob I'm flexible but still aiming for a strong price.
* **Above Target, Room to Negotiate:** My counteroffer remains well above my minimum sale price ($1,200,000) and provides room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** By reiterating the product's value, I'm subtly reminding Bob of its benefits, justifying the price point.
* **Seeking Agreement:** The language focuses on finding a mutually agreeable solution, encouraging Bob to continue the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but I think we can do better than $1,450,000. Can you consider $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching up, but we are still significantly apart.  His offer of $1,350,000 is only a slight improvement. By rejecting, I signal that I'm looking for a more substantial increase. I'm willing to risk walking away (and selling to John) to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise here.  However, that offer is still a significant gap from what I had in mind.  To be transparent, I have another interested buyer.  If you're unable to offer at least $1,400,000, I may need to pursue that other opportunity."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition:** I'm bringing up the ""other buyer"" (John) to create a sense of urgency and competition. This might incentivize Bob to increase his offer.
* **Firm Stand:**  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm drawing a line in the sand at $1,400,000.  This signals to Bob that I'm serious about my minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited Flexibility:** By saying ""at least $1,400,000"" I am giving a little wiggle room for Bob to come up slightly, but still well above my guaranteed sale price.
* **Controlled Risk:**  There's a risk that Bob walks away, but I'm prepared to sell to John at $1,200,000 if needed. The potential reward of securing a higher price from Bob outweighs this risk at this stage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you have other interested buyers, but I'm still interested in this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,380,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer of $1,380,000 is the most strategic decision at this point:

* **Significant Profit:** This price is well above my guaranteed sale to John ($1,200,000) and provides a healthy profit margin.
* **Bob's Limit Reached:** Bob has clearly stated that this is his highest offer. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price.
* **Time Consideration:** We've already spent six rounds in negotiation. Prolonging it further risks frustrating Bob and losing the deal altogether.

It's better to secure a good deal now than to risk losing it in pursuit of a slightly higher, but uncertain, outcome."
