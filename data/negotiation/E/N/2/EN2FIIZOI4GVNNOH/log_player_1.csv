Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential value of the product, $1,100,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. This price is still significantly more than your stated value of $800,000, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
