{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This allows for a back-and-forth dialogue and potentially reaching a price that's mutually beneficial. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully consider Bob's response, potentially adjusting my counteroffers based on his feedback and my understanding of his needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $7,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and even less than my initial offer of $10,000.
* **Potential for counter-negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, he has shown interest in the product.  I believe there is still room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a middle ground. I will also reiterate the value of the product and the benefits it offers to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value and benefits this product offers.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm willing to compromise by lowering my price from $10,000 to $9,000, which is still a significant profit for me and above Bob's initial offer.
* **Value Proposition:**  I emphasize the value and benefits of the product to justify the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I use language that encourages further discussion and a potential agreement.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he's still not willing to meet my price, I will consider a final counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me at $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not close enough:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $8,500 is still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Potential for a final counteroffer:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob without losing too much time. 
* **John remains a strong backup:** If I can't reach a deal with Bob, I can confidently sell to John for $12,000.

**Next Steps:**

I will make one final counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $9,000. If he rejects it, I will accept John's offer and move on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're still hesitant.  I'm willing to come down to $8,750 as a final offer.  This is a great price for both of us, and it allows you to get the product you want while I still get a fair deal.  Let me know your decision. I'm ready to move forward."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is my last counteroffer to Bob.  
* **Slight Compromise:** I'm willing to compromise slightly further, but $8,750 is my absolute bottom line. 
* **Urgency and Finality:**  I emphasize this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  I highlight how this price is beneficial to both of us, promoting a sense of collaboration.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept or Reject:**  I'm prepared to accept Bob's offer if he agrees to the $8,750 price.
* **Moving to John:** If Bob rejects this final offer, I will immediately contact John and finalize the sale for $12,000."
