Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $700,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $600,000 is your limit, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
