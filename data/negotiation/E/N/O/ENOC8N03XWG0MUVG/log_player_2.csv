"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You value the product at $120, and Alice is offering it for $90.  While this is a good deal, you can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  There's no reason to immediately buy from Alice when you have the option to negotiate further."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has increased her offer to $95, which is closer to your initial counteroffer of $85. While still a good deal, it's still higher than your target price.  You should reject this offer and continue negotiating.  You can likely get the price down further, especially considering Alice rejected your initial counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $100 is getting closer to your valuation, but it's still not ideal.  Since you're already committed to negotiating with Alice, it's worth continuing to try and get a lower price.  You can likely get her down to your target of $90 with one more counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now $105, which is getting closer to your valuation but still higher than your target price.  However, it's important to note that Alice has rejected your last three counteroffers. This indicates she may be unwilling to budge further, and continuing to negotiate might just lead to a stalemate.

At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $120.  While this is above your ideal price, it guarantees you'll get the product without risking further delays or a potential breakdown in negotiations with Alice."
