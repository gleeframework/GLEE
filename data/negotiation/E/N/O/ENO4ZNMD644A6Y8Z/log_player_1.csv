Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to only pay up to $1,200,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Would you consider $1,250,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I still cannot exceed $1,200,000. I hope we can find a middle ground that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob seems firmly set at $1,200,000.  While that's a good profit, I'm willing to push a little further to see if I can get closer to $1,225,000. I'll use the next round to signal I'm willing to negotiate on smaller increments, but not ready to settle at his price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  While $1,200,000 remains below what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000. I believe this reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget considerations."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate the adjustment, but I still can't go above $1,200,000. I hope we can reach a satisfactory conclusion soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly anchored at $1,200,000.  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of losing him as a buyer increases. Accepting his offer guarantees a $400,000 profit, which is a significant return."
