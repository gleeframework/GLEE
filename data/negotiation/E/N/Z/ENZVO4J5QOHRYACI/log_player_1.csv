Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a special price of $14,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I could offer it at $15,000 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob will pay a higher price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $14,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still a ""deal"" compared to John's offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price closer to $15,000. 

This approach balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
