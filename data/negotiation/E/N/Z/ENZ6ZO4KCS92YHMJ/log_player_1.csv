I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a good starting point because it's  a little bit more than my minimum price of $8,000, and it leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to pay closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's higher than John's offer, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me. I believe I can push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $9,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer but still closer to my ideal price than Bob's offer. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still not my ideal price, it's getting closer and closer to my minimum.  There's a good chance that pushing further will result in Bob walking away, and I don't want to risk losing this sale altogether.  $8,700 is a decent profit and ensures the sale is made."
