Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you see in this product, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
