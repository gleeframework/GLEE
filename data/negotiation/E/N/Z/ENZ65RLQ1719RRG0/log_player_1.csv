"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price in the next round. While $600,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I have room to negotiate and don't want to settle for a price so far below my target."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $800,000. It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $800000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $700000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

While $700,000 is closer to my target, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I'm confident I can get a better deal with some continued negotiation.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."

Round 6

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go lower than $740,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 740000}

Round 8
