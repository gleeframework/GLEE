,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $600000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $800000. It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $800000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $700000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $700000 still doesn't work for me. Let's try $750000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product's value worth the investment.",750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $725000, but that's as high as I can go.",725000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go lower than $740000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.  What do you say?",740000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but $740000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $720000?",720000.0,Bob,8,
