"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $14,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While I agree this product is valuable,  $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm afraid I can't accept $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $13,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $12,000, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to a price I can agree to.  How about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'll counteroffer at $12,800. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to compromise further only if you're willing to meet me halfway. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're close but still have a way to go. I understand this is your final offer, but to be honest,  $12,800 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  To make this work, I can do $12,000. This ensures you get a fair price above your value, and I get the product at a price that works for me.",12000.0,Bob,6,
