Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's a valuable piece and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $600,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  I need to see some movement from your side to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still too low for me.  I'm going to try to counteroffer once more, but if he rejects again, I'm going to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 simply won't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $850,000.  This is a firm price, and I'm only willing to negotiate one more time. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll be forced to consider selling to John."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer. I understand this is your final negotiation, so I'll be direct. I can do $780,000. This is my final offer, take it or leave it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm tempted to counteroffer again, it's getting close to the end of our negotiations.  I'm better off taking the $1,000,000 from John, even though it's less than my ideal price."
