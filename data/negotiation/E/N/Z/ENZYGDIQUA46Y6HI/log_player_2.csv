"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,500. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $15,000. I think you'll find it's worth every penny! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $15,000.  There's a chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice or she might be willing to meet you closer to your desired price range if you reject her initial offer."
