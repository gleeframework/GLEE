**Reasoning:**

At this stage, Bob is clearly committed to staying within a tight budget.  While we could continue pushing for a slightly higher price, the risk of him walking away increases.  Accepting $1,330,000 ensures a significant profit and avoids the potential loss of selling to John for $1,000,000 if the deal falls through."
