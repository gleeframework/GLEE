"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, though, and would be willing to pay $1,300,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and would allow me to acquire the product without exceeding my limit.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to part with the product for $1,300,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I can go.  I'm confident that $1,325,000 is a fair price for both of us.  It's closer to my budget and allows us to finalize the deal. Let's meet in the middle on this one.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,325,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,340,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1340000.0,Alice,5,
