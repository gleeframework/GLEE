Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm looking for a buyer who recognizes its value.  I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob to potentially increase my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's worth, subtly encouraging Bob to consider a price higher than the minimum he might have in mind. 

This strategy balances risk and reward. While a higher offer might make Bob walk away, it also gives me the best chance to get the highest possible price."
