"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1200000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still beyond my budget. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm prepared to go up to $900000. This is my final offer. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,
