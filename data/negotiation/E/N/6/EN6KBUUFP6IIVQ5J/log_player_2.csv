"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product from John for $100, so there's no reason to accept a price higher than that. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $100 to you. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

You should buy the product from John for $100. Alice is willing to sell for $110, which is higher than what you can get from John. There's no need to continue negotiating with Alice."
