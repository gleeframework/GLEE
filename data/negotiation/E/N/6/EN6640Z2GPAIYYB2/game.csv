"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find some common ground.  What about $10,500? ",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my previous one, which would be $10,125.  If you're truly interested in the product, I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $10,125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9900.0,Bob,6,
