Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state why the product is so valuable, it hints at a ""unique value proposition."" This creates intrigue and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for John:** Even if Bob accepts a price lower than my initial offer, I've left a buffer to ensure I can still potentially get a better deal from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Interest:** Bob's counteroffer of $900,000 demonstrates serious interest in the product. He's willing to pay more than his perceived value, signaling room for negotiation. 
* **Above Minimum:** $900,000 is already above my absolute minimum. However, there's still a potential $100,000 gap between Bob's offer and John's guaranteed purchase.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's initial counteroffer, I aim to gauge his upper limit. There's a chance he might significantly increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It's clear you recognize the value of this product. While I'm motivated to find a deal, I can't go as low as $900,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Value:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and his understanding of the product's value. This helps maintain a positive negotiation tone.
* **Firm but Flexible:**  I stand my ground by not immediately accepting Bob's offer.  However, I demonstrate flexibility by significantly lowering my initial ask to signal willingness to make a deal.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The $1,100,000 price point is still substantially above my minimum and leaves room for potential further negotiation while keeping the deal more attractive than John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer increased by only $50,000, indicating his upper limit might not be significantly higher than his current offer. 
* **Minimal Gains:**  While $950,000 is a good offer, continuing negotiation with Bob carries the risk of him walking away or only incrementally increasing his offer.  The potential gain from further negotiation with Bob is likely small.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer of $1,000,000 guarantees a clean, immediate profit without further negotiation or risk. 

At this point, the certainty of John's offer outweighs the potential for slightly higher gains from Bob."
