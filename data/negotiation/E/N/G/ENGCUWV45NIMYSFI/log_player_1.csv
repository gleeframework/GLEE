{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $14,500 is a strong starting point. It's significantly less than my minimum but still leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The knowledge that John will buy the product for $15,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell below my minimum."
