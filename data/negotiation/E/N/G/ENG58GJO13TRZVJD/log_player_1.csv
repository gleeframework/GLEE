"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  I know it's worth a lot more to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and allows me to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92.50. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to $100.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $92.50 is still just a little too low for me.  Let's try $94. This is a fair price that's closer to both of our desired values."", ""product_price"": 94}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $94 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $92. I'm getting close to my budget, and I'd like to make a final offer. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're at your budget limit, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  Let's meet in the middle at $93. I'm confident we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 93}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, Alice, but $93 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one final offer of $91. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll make the purchase. If not, I'll consider buying from John for $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tough call, but with only two rounds left, I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum, but I'm not sure I can get him to go higher in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and I'm not comfortable risking losing a sale to John just to get a few more dollars from Bob."
