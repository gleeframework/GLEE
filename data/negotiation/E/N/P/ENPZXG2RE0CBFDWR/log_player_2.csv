}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $70 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming for a better price. We'll counter again and see if we can get closer to $75."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that.  But $75 is still below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle at $80. It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice has come down to her value for the product.  It's unlikely she'll go lower and this is a good deal for us."
