"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Given its potential, I'm offering it for $1,450,000.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,450,000 is slightly outside my budget.  I'd be happy to purchase the product for $1,350,000. This price aligns with my current financial capabilities and allows for a fair margin for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that $1,375,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial deal.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close. I value your interest and am motivated to close this deal. How about we settle at $1,387,500?  This represents a small concession on my end while ensuring a fair price for this valuable asset.",1387500.0,Alice,5,
