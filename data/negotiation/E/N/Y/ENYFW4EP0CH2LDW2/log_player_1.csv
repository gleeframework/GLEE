"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $18000 is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 simply wouldn't cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This would allow me to still make a profit and hopefully remain within your budget."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $13000? That's a good compromise and closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. $13,000 is a good compromise, and it's getting closer to my minimum price. There's no guarantee that I can get a higher offer in the next rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
