,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18000 is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12000 simply wouldn't cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle at $15000? This would allow me to still make a profit and hopefully remain within your budget.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $13000? That's a good compromise and closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
