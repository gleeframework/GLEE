"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,400,000. This feels like a fair price considering the value I place on it.  I'm open to discussing this further.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and present yours.  While I understand your perspective, $1,400,000 falls significantly short of what I believe the product is worth. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This reflects the true value and potential of what's being offered.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for being willing to negotiate.  While I appreciate your offer, it's still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. Given the value I see in the product, I'm prepared to go up to $1,600,000.  This is a fair compromise and would allow us both to move forward.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I acknowledge your willingness to compromise and meet in the middle.  However, the value of this product is substantial.  Let's settle at $1,800,000.  This feels like a fair offer, and I'm hopeful we can conclude this deal.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
