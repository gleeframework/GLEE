{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $175 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts high, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary.  It's also important to start with a friendly message to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer but $125 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and I go down to $150? This product is really something special, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer $150, Bob's offer of $140 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price and it's likely that we won't get any closer.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product."
