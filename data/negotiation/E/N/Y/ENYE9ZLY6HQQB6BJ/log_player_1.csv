I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm not willing to sell to John yet as I think there's still potential to reach a higher price with Bob."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my original target, $885,000 is a good deal. It's significantly better than selling to John and we've reached a compromise. There's a good chance that trying to negotiate further could lead to a stalemate or even a lower price."
