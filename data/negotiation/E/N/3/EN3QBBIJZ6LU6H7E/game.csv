"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that would benefit both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is quite a bit below what I believe the product is worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would still be a significant discount for you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. I'm confident we can close this deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $950,000 is closer to what I envisioned, I'm still seeking a slightly higher price. Would you consider $975,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product while offering you a favorable deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
