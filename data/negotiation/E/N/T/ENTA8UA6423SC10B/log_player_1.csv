"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. It's a bit higher than my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I'm also keeping in mind the 10-round limit, so I want to get a good starting point."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $75 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject it.  I'm not sure how much further Bob is willing to go, but I think there's still room for negotiation.  I'm also aware of the 10-round limit, and I want to see if we can make a deal before I have to consider selling to John."
