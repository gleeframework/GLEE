"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $900,000. This price is fair and allows for a comfortable margin for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but the gap between $900,000 and my valuation is still significant.  I could consider letting it go for $1,050,000. This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the true value of this product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a stretch for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your position. Let's make this work - I'm willing to come down to $1,012,500.  This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's inherent value.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
