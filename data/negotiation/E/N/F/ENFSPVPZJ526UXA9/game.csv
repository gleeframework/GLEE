"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise a bit. Let me know if that works for you!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit far off from your new offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counter with $12500. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about $13250? It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12000. I'm willing to compromise one more time, so I'll counter with $12100. I think this is the best I can do, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",12100.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $12100, but I need to make a bit more. Let's meet exactly in the middle at $12200. It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can accept it.",12200.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $12200, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll counter with $12000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can accept it.",12000.0,Bob,8,
