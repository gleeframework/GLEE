"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $11,500. I believe it offers significant value at this price, considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for a lower price from John or potentially negotiate a better deal with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  It's a good price, and it's better than what he'd pay from John. There's a decent chance he could continue to negotiate, but the risk of losing the deal entirely is too high."
