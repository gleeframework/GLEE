# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it! I'm asking $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

It's worth exploring if I can get a better deal from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget right now. Would you be willing to consider $80? I'm sure we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 80}
