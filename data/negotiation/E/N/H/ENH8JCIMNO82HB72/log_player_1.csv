{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it! I'm asking $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a high price but leaves room for negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the product's appeal to Bob, which might encourage him to engage. By setting a high initial price, I can potentially maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget right now. Would you be willing to consider $80? I'm sure we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer more, accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John at the same price."
