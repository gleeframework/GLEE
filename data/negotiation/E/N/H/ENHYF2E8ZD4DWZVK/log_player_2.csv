"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $1,500,000 and both Alice and John are offering the product at this price, it makes no sense to engage in negotiations with Alice. There's no potential for saving money, and you risk Alice rejecting your counteroffers and wasting time. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum price."
