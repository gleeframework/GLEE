Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit below what I need.  Let's compromise at $1,050,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable product while ensuring I receive a fair price. I believe this is a reasonable offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.
