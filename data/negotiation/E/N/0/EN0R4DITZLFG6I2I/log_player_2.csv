"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's initial offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum price. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds to go, and John is offering a better price if no agreement can be reached with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll derive from it."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still above John's price. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to potentially secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $1,000,000. While it's closer, it's still not a deal that saves him any money compared to buying from John.  There are still 7 rounds remaining, and Bob can likely negotiate a better price by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While I value the product, $1,025,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it, which is my absolute maximum. I believe this is a fair price, considering both our perspectives. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering his maximum price, which is also the price John is offering. This puts pressure on Alice to either accept and make a small profit or risk losing the sale altogether. If Alice rejects, Bob can immediately switch to John and get the product for his maximum price. There are still 6 rounds left, which makes this a strong move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's maximum price of $1,000,000.  There are only 5 rounds left, and it's unlikely that Alice will budge further.  Bob has already made his maximum offer, and continuing to negotiate is a risk.  Buying from John is the best option at this point as it guarantees the product at his target price."
