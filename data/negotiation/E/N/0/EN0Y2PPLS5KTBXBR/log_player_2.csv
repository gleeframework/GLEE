"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  After reviewing the value it offers, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,000,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I've assessed, I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value this product brings is substantial. I could consider coming down to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. $925,000 is still higher than he's willing to pay. He should continue to negotiate a lower price, as he has room to go lower before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I can only offer $850,000.  It's a significant step toward a deal, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
