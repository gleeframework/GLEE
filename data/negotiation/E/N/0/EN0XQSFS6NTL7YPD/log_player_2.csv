Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. We understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and we're willing to work with you.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

At $725,000, Alice is getting closer to her bottom line, and it's a reasonable price considering my $1,500,000 limit. It's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk the negotiations stalling or pushing Alice away completely."
