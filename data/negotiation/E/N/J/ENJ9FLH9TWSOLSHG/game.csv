"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my valuation of the product, I'm prepared to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. While I acknowledge its potential, $1,700,000 is still beyond my comfort zone.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, which reflects a significant commitment from my side. I'm confident this price allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
