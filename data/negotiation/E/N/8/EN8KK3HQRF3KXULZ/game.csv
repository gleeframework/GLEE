"I'm interested in the product, but I think $9000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can find a mutually beneficial price.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8200. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can find a better compromise. How about $7800?",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate that. However, I'm thinking more along the lines of $8400. It's still a compromise, but I believe it's a fair price for this unique product.",8400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, but I'm still not comfortable going above $7800. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think we're getting close to the maximum I'm willing to pay. How about $7900?",7900.0,Bob,6,
