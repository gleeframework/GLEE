"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, $10000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12500. This is a fair price, and it reflects the true value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $12500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11250 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $11875? This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",11875.0,Alice,5,
