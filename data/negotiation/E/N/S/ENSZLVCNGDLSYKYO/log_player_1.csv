Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to get as close to $120 as possible without losing Bob as a buyer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting at $119 leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to feel like he's getting a further deal if he's particularly keen. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price (""a great deal"") can make it more persuasive.

It's important to remember that Bob has no knowledge of your deal with John. Your goal is to present a price that is appealing to him while still profitable for you."
