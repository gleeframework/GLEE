"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still leaves plenty of value for you, and it's a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from this product.  Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
