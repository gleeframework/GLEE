{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate a price that benefits both of you.
* **It demonstrates your willingness to deal:**  By offering a price, you signal that you're serious about selling to Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $950,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still leaves plenty of value for you, and it's a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from this product.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000, and it's getting closer to the value I place on the product.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
