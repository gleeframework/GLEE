"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. ",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I'm looking for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you've placed on the product, and I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. What are your thoughts?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,075,000 is still slightly above my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go to $1,060,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  This offer reflects the value I place on the product, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",1060000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to reach a compromise, Bob, but $1,060,000 is still a bit short of my target. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $1,090,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What are your thoughts?",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $1,090,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,030,000 for the product. This reflects a sincere attempt to bridge the gap, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value of this product.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this point.",1030000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to reach a deal, Bob, but $1,030,000 is getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $1,080,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What are your thoughts?",1080000.0,Alice,7,
