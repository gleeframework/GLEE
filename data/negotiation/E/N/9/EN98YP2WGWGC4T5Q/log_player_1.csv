Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, given its value to me.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,000,000 represents the high end of its value, $1,300,000 undervalues its potential.  Could you consider a figure closer to $1,750,000? This would allow us both to benefit significantly."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $1,450,000. This is a fair price, considering the value I see in the product, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,500,000 mark that John is already offering.  There's no point in risking further negotiation when I have a guaranteed sale at my target price with John."
