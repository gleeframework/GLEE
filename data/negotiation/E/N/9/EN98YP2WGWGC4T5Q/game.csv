"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, given its value to me.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,000,000 represents the high end of its value, $1,300,000 undervalues its potential.  Could you consider a figure closer to $1,750,000? This would allow us both to benefit significantly.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $1,450,000. This is a fair price, considering the value I see in the product, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
