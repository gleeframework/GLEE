"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8875?  It's a small adjustment, and I'm confident this is a price we can both be happy with.",8875.0,Alice,5,
