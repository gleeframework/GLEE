Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8750.  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm still hoping to get a better price than $8,750, so I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I'm close to my minimum price, but I don't want to sell the product to John unless it's absolutely necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,875?  It's a small adjustment, and I'm confident this is a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 8875} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $8875 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and settle at $8800.  I'm confident this is a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm getting close to my minimum price, and with only a few rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower profit.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $9,000, Bob's offer is reasonable, and it's best to secure the deal now."
