"Thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate the value you place on it, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. How about $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm afraid $1500000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $2000000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this stage. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given the current market conditions and my financial situation, I am unable to meet the $2000000 price point. I would like to propose $1800000 as a fair compromise.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $1800000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about my own costs and expenses. I'm now offering the product to you for $2200000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",2200000.0,Alice,5,

"I've been willing to negotiate with you for several rounds, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm now offering the product to you for $2100000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",2100000.0,Alice,7,

"I've been patient and flexible, Bob, but I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet on price. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to think about my own goals and objectives. I'm now offering the product to you for $2200000, but I'm also willing to throw in some additional perks and support to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",2200000.0,Alice,9,
