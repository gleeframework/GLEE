"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($10,000) and John's offer ($10,000). It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a low offer significantly below my actual budget limit gives me room to negotiate upwards and hopefully reach a price closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price, which is likely somewhere above her product's worth of $15,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but $6,000 is also a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $12,000. Would you be willing to go for that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $12,000 is closer to a reasonable compromise, it's still above both my budget and John's offer. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we settle at $8,000? That's a fair offer considering its market value."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Meeting halfway:**  Alice counter-offered with $12,000 after my initial low offer of $6,000.  Meeting her halfway at $8,000 shows willingness to negotiate while still staying below my budget.
* **Market Value Argument:**  While I haven't revealed my budget, mentioning ""market value"" subtly implies I'm aware of other potential prices and am trying to be fair.
* **Room to Negotiate:** This leaves some space to potentially go up slightly if needed, while still staying below my $10,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $12,000, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $10,000? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll really appreciate the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer now matches both your budget limit and John's offer. There's no benefit to rejecting this offer and potentially losing the opportunity to purchase the product at this price."
