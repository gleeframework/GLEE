Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is a good starting point to maximize my profit. I know the product is worth at least $150 to me, so this offer gives me some room to negotiate.  I'm curious to see if Bob is willing to pay this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering $175. This is still above my minimum, but a more realistic price considering Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping this compromise will be enough to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is still less than my desired price, but it's above my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's getting close to John's offer, so I'll accept Bob's offer to secure a sale and avoid the risk of losing both buyers."
