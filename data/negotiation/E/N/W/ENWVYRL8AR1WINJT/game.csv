"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'd be happy to consider purchasing the product for $1,050,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I'm confident that we can both benefit from this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it and my desire to reach a fair agreement. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,125,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1,125,000 is still not enough for me to meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to make one last concession and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the final price I'm willing to consider, and I'm confident it's a fair reflection of the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
