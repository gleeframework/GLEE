Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While Bob values the product at $100, it's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than his perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $125 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer or feel like he's getting a better deal even if he doesn't negotiate.
* **Above Minimum:** This price ensures Alice still makes a profit above her minimum acceptable price of $150 if John buys it.

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit from Bob while still having the safety net of selling to John."
