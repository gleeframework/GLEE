"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the product for $8,000 from John.  There's no reason to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

Bob is starting with a lower offer, hoping to get a good deal. He's going to be aggressive, but still stay within his budget. $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer the product to you for $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,500 is closer to his budget, it's still above his preferred price. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, making this offer not worth considering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

Bob is sticking with his strategy of being aggressive but remaining within his budget.  He's hoping to find a middle ground with Alice, but he's also aware that he can always get the product from John for $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a good price, but I'm not willing to give up too much profit. I'll meet you at $9,500, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $9,500 is getting close to his preferred price, he's still only $500 away from getting the product for $8,000 from John. It makes sense for him to continue negotiating to try and get a better price from Alice, especially since they're getting closer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?  This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

Bob is trying to close the deal by offering a price that's close to Alice's last offer, but still within his budget.  He's hoping to show Alice that he's serious about buying the product and that he's willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to meet you at $9,250. I'll meet you at $9,600, and that's as close to the original price as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  He's already spent 6 rounds trying to negotiate a better price with Alice, and she's only come down $400 from her initial offer.  At this point, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice and getting a better price isn't worth the potential of her rejecting his offer and losing a valuable round. 

Since Bob can get the product for $8,000 from John, it makes more sense to secure the deal with John and save himself time and potential frustration."
