"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer the product to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to meet you at $9,250. I'll meet you at $9,600, and that's as close to the original price as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",9600.0,Alice,7,,
