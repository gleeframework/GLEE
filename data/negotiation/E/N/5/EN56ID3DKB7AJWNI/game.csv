"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I can meet you halfway at $90, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this great product.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $75 is still a bit below my target. I can do $92, which is my final offer. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better one elsewhere.",92.0,Alice,5,
