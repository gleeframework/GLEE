Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $75 is still a bit below my target. I can do $92, which is my final offer. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better one elsewhere.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $90 and is firm in her final offer. It's better to secure the product at the guaranteed $80 from John than risk further negotiation with Alice."
