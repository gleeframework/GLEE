"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your position, the value of this product is significant and $700,000 undervalues it considerably. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's try  $925,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $825,000. I think that's a fair price for the product.",825000.0,Bob,4,
