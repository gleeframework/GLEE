"Alice, $12000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $9000 right now. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than my initial ask, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $10500. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $9750? It's a fair price for both of us, and I can close the deal right away.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9750 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $10200. It's a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10200.0,Alice,5,
