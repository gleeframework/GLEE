Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows me to sell quickly and gives you a significant discount. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, highlighting the benefits for both of us. This helps to build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a price point that is acceptable to both of us, while still allowing me to make a decent profit.  By starting high and being prepared to negotiate, I can potentially maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in your product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting his offer would result in a major financial loss for me.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round of negotiation. I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore a counteroffer that is more favorable to me. I am confident that I can secure a better price than $700,000, but I also want to avoid losing the opportunity to sell to Bob altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $700,000 is simply too low for me to consider. However, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $900,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. I believe this is a good middle ground for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer of $1,000,000 but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints while also emphasizing the value of the product and the fact that I'm willing to negotiate. This conveys that I'm serious about reaching a deal but won't accept an offer that is unfair to me.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to meet Bob halfway while still securing a price that is close to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping that this counteroffer will convince Bob to come up a bit from his initial offer, potentially leading to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the threshold I'm willing to accept. I'm determined to get closer to $1,200,000.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round of negotiation. I'm still willing to negotiate but will need to push for a higher price. I'm confident that I can secure a better price, and I don't want to settle for less than I believe the product is worth."
