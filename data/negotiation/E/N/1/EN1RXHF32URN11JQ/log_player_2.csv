Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $700,000 is simply too low for me to consider. However, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $900,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. I believe this is a good middle ground for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
