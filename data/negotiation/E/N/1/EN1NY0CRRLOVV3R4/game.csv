"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you.  It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I know it would be just as valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
