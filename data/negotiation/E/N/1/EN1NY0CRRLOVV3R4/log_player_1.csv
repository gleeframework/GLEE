Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you.  It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I know it would be just as valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  The message is friendly and highlights the potential value of the product for Bob. It also emphasizes the fairness of the price.
* **Price:** I've set the price at $1,250,000, which is a $50,000 increase from my minimum desired price. This is a reasonable markup that could potentially be accepted by Bob, while still ensuring I earn more than selling to John.

**Reasoning:**

* By offering a price slightly higher than my minimum, I'm leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* The message focuses on the value of the product to Bob, which could make him more willing to accept the offer. 
* This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still having a backup option with John."
