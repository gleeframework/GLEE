Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a bit higher than my minimum value. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed. If Bob rejects, I'll see what his counteroffer is and assess if it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum value, I'm going to try and get a better price. I'll counter with a higher price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering at $125. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  Hopefully, this shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a price closer to my original valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $115.  While it's still lower than my initial goal, it's higher than John's offer and closer to my minimum value.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether, and $115 is a decent outcome."
