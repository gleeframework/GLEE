"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is enticing, it's still higher than the product's worth to her.  There's potential for a better deal.  I'll counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I can meet you halfway, though. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If that's still not acceptable, I'm happy to discuss further, but I won't go lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to budge on her price, and it remains higher than her own valuation of the product.  While I could continue to negotiate, the likelihood of reaching a significantly better price seems low.  Buying from John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed option and, while not ideal, is still within my budget."
