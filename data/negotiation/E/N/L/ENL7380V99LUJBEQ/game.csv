"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's close this deal.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about acquiring the product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering $14,500. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really interested in this product, but $14,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $13,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  I'm ready to make this deal happen.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're getting close to your limit, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $14,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",14000.0,Alice,7,
