"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $18,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's way above his budget. He can try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her first offer, it's still above his budget.  He should continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a price closer to his limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about acquiring the product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering $14,500. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's still above his budget. While Alice is getting closer, he can try to negotiate further and see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really interested in this product, but $14,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $13,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  I'm ready to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're getting close to your limit, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $14,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $14,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000. 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget.**  While she's getting closer, he's already made his final offer and she rejected it.
* **John's offer is the best option.** John is offering the product for $12,000, which is exactly Bob's maximum budget. 

Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a better price, and Bob risks losing the product to someone else if he's too slow. It's time to move forward with the guaranteed deal with John."
