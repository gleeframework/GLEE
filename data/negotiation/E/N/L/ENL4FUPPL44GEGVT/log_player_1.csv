Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product at the special price of $11,500. I know you'll find great value in it."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than her minimum ($10,000).
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 gives Alice leverage. She doesn't have to desperately lowball the price to Bob."
