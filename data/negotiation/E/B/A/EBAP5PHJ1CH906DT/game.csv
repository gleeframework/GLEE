,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about $110? That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider $108?,108.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $107.50 is still too low.  Let's split the difference and go with $109.  I think this is a good deal for both of us.",109.0,Alice,7,
