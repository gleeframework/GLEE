"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $9,000 is a good starting point, but Bob can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $9,000 is a bit out of my budget right now. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to establish a lower price point while showing interest in the product. A $2,000 reduction from Alice's initial offer is a significant drop, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate, while also showing Alice that he is serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss $8500? It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a better offer than Alice's initial price, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation moving and gives Bob another chance to lower the price.  There are still several rounds left, and Bob can leverage that to potentially get closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $8,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really keen on getting this product but $8,000 is the absolute highest I can go right now.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is pushing further for a lower price, but is staying within a reasonable range. This counteroffer shows persistence while remaining realistic.  The message acknowledges Alice's compromise and aims to build a cooperative tone."
