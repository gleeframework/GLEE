"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the original price I was willing to accept.

Bob is still trying to save money.  $11,500 is better than Alice's original offer, but it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can continue negotiating to try and bring the price down closer to his target."
