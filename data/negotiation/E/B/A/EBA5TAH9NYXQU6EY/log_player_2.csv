"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price of $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason:While $130 is lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to go lower to make a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low but Reasonable:**  We start significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her valuation. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling we're serious buyers.
* **Polite and Open:**  The tone is polite and suggestive rather than demanding, encouraging a collaborative negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer aims to bring the price closer to a point where both parties benefit while leaving us buffer room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving towards a more agreeable price, but we still have some bargaining power. A counter-offer between $105 and $120 might encourage her to settle closer to our desired price range.  We're still well below John's $150 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $115 seems fair, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counter-offer splits the difference between Alice's latest offer ($120) and our previous offer ($110). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.
* **Direct but Respectful:** The language maintains a friendly and respectful tone, crucial for successful negotiation. 
* **Strategic Consideration:** We're getting closer to our target price while still leaving room for a potential final counter-offer from Alice. This keeps the negotiation moving without jeopardizing the deal by going too low, too quickly."
