I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from John's offer, but it gives Bob the potential to acquire the product at a price that may still be valuable to him.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  A higher price means a higher potential profit for me.
* **Risk vs. reward:** While there's a risk Bob will reject the offer, the potential reward of earning an extra $500,000 outweighs that risk.
* **Negotiation leverage:**  I'm setting a high starting point for negotiation, giving me room to potentially compromise if Bob counter-offers."
