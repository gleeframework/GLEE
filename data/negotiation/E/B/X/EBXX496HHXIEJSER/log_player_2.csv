"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's below your maximum, there's room for negotiation.
* **You want to save as much money as possible.**  
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate.** This gives you time to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  It's still a good deal for you considering your value of $8,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This still gives you a great deal and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the transaction.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is coming down, but not enough.**  $11,000 is still a significant premium over what you want to pay. 
* **You're still early in the negotiation.** You have 7 rounds left to try and get a lower price. 
* **You can afford to be patient.** You have the option to buy from John if you can't reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,750? It's a compromise, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your desired price.**  $10,750 is only $250 above your last counteroffer.
* **You're making good progress.**  You've successfully brought the price down significantly from the initial $12,000.
* **You have 5 rounds remaining.** You could try to negotiate further, but there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise, and you might end up paying more in the end.

**It's a good deal for you, considering your maximum budget and the value of the product to you.**  Accepting this offer ensures you get the product without exceeding your limit."
