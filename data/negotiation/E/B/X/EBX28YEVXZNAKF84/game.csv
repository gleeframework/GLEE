"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I still think $1,225,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $1,175,000, which is closer to my target price. Can we discuss further?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've been considering your perspective, and I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $1,200,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,175,000, which is the same price I mentioned in round 4. Can we finalize the deal at this price?",1175000.0,Bob,6,
