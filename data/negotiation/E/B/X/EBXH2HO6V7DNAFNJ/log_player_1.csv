Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since I value the product at no less than $1,200,000, I'll make an offer that's slightly higher than that. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $1,250,000}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer of $1,200,000. Since this is the minimum value I'm willing to accept, I think I'll accept Bob's offer. I'll sell the product to Bob for $1,200,000.
