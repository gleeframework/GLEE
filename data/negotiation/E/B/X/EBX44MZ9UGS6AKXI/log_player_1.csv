"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above the product's worth to Bob, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'd prefer to see if I can secure a better deal through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
``` 

I'm counter-offering with $165, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $162. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $162
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my desired profit margin, and I'm confident that we can close the deal. It's a better outcome than selling to John."
