I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, while still being a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm also aware that I can always walk away and sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price of $15,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise, as it's halfway between my original offer and Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to accept, as it still provides me with a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is pretty close to my initial counter-offer of $14,000.  I'm willing to accept this deal as it provides me with a solid profit while avoiding the risk of a further negotiation that could potentially result in a lower price."
