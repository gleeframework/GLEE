"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with an offer above your desired selling price. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that you believe strongly in the product's value. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,000,000, you set a high anchor point. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counteroffer may be closer to your desired range than if you started lower.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value (""unique features,"" ""potential for your business"") to justify the high asking price. 

**Strategy:** 

The goal is to gauge Bob's willingness to pay while keeping the deal alive. I'm open to negotiation but won't hesitate to walk away if his offers are significantly lower than my minimum. The option of John's guaranteed $1,500,000 offer provides a strong safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,600,000 is a substantial sum and closer to my minimum price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's message indicates interest and a willingness to engage in the bargaining process. 

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with an offer slightly above my absolute minimum to test his flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm confident in the value this product brings, particularly for a business like yours.  I could consider coming down to $1,725,000.  This reflects a more realistic middle ground while acknowledging the value it holds."",
""product_price"": 1725000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate by significantly decreasing the price from the initial offer. However, it's still comfortably above my absolute minimum. 
* **Justification:** The message reinforces the product's value and frames the reduced price as a concession.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer puts pressure on Bob. It's a strong signal that I'm serious about selling but not desperate. It encourages him to move closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:** While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob seems anchored at $1,600,000.  The potential gain from further negotiation is relatively small compared to the risk of losing the sale entirely. 
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation adds uncertainty. Accepting now secures a significant profit and allows me to move on to other opportunities.
* **Strong Offer:** $1,600,000 is a substantial amount and well above my absolute minimum. It represents a successful outcome for the negotiation."
