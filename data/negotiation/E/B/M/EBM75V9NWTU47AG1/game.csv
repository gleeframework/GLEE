"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more than that! Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you consider $8,500? I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $8,750?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a little more, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $8,875. This would be a fair deal for both of us.",8875.0,Alice,5,
