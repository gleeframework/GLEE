Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90, which is slightly above what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers. However, it's also a price that I'm comfortable with since it's above my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $65 is tempting, it's below my minimum threshold of $80. I'm not willing to sell at a loss. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $75? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 75} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $75. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's below his perceived value of $80. However, it also keeps me above my minimum threshold of $80. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and we can reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  Let's meet in the middle - How about $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $70 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum threshold of $80, and it's a fair price considering his perceived value of $80. Accepting his offer will allow me to sell the product quickly and without further negotiation."
