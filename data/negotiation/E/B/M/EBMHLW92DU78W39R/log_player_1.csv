Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal. I'll be prepared to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is below my minimum price, but I'm not ready to give up on negotiating with Bob. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. Hopefully, this is a reasonable price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, and while I'd prefer to get more, I'm not sure we'll get any closer. I'm also concerned that if I reject this offer, Bob might decide to walk away altogether.  $11,500 is a decent amount, so I'll take it."
