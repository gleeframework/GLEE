"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. It's worth at least $1500000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000.  This is a significant opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,400,000, while John is selling it for $1,500,000. 
* **You're still getting a good deal:**  Even though the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, you can acquire it for $1,400,000, saving $100,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous decision."
