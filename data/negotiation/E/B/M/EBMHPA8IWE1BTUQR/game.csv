"Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a valuable asset that holds significant potential. I'm confident it can be a game changer for your business. My initial price is $1800000.  I'm open to discussing this further.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1400000 is a bit too low for me. I'm confident in the value of this product and believe it's worth more than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1600000?  This price reflects the product's potential and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try $1450000?",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1450000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1550000.  This price gives you a significant advantage, and it also allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1300000 simply isn't workable for me. I'm confident in this product's value and I'm committed to getting a fair price.  To move forward, I'm willing to offer it to you at $1400000.  This price recognizes your interest and also ensures a fair deal for me. Let's close this deal. ",1400000.0,Alice,7,
