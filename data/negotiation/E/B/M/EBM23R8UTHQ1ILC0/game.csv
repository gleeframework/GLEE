"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement quickly. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. While I'm interested,  $12000 is a bit higher than I'd hoped for right now. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $10000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11500. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to start considering other options.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $12000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $12200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",12200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12200 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11500, which is closer to the midpoint we were discussing.  If you're not open to that, I'll have to start looking at other options.",11500.0,Bob,6,
