"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it at $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. I have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Alice. However, $110 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $85?"",
 ""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still a reasonable markup from her value. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** My message aims to be polite and convey that I'm interested but need a more competitive price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $85 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $97.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to my desired price range, $97.50 is still significantly higher than both her value ($80) and a good deal for me. I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $90? That feels like a fair compromise."",
 ""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:** Alice demonstrated a willingness to negotiate by countering my offer. I'll continue the process to try and secure a better deal.
* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to her price, but still within a range that represents significant savings compared to my alternative (John at $120).
* **Direct and Clear:**  My message is direct, proposing a specific price and emphasizing that it represents a fair deal for both parties."
