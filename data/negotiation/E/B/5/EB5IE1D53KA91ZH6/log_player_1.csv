Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $140 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too high to be unreasonable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price allows for some negotiation room if Bob counteroffers, while still securing a decent profit for Alice.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:**  Alice can still choose to accept John's offer of $150 if the negotiation with Bob drags on or becomes too difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim for Higher:**  While $130 is better than Bob's initial value of $120, it's still below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for Improvement:** Alice has a chance to secure a better price by counteroffering.
* **No Urgency:** There's no indication that John's offer is time-sensitive, allowing Alice to continue negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. $130 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $135?  That would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  The counteroffer of $135 is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** It's a more appealing option than immediately accepting Bob's offer, but still lower than Alice's initial price.
* **Keeping John's Offer in Mind:** This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while remembering that John's offer of $150 remains a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $132.  Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While $132 is getting closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price, it's still below her desired profit margin.
* **No Significant Gain:**  Further negotiation with Bob is likely to result in a small price increase at best, not worth the potential time and effort.
* **Secure Profit:** Selling to John guarantees Alice her desired profit of $150, eliminating the risk of further negotiation and potential failure. 

Alice has a better opportunity to secure a higher price with John, so it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed profit than to continue haggling with Bob for a small gain."
