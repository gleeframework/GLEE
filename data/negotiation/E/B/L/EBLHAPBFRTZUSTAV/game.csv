"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering its potential worth to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,100,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant gain for you given my maximum budget. I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,000,000? This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget constraints.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $1,000,000 is a good offer, it's still not quite within my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which I believe represents a fair compromise given our respective positions. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this point.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. I've tried to be flexible, but $900,000 is still a significant gap from what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  To be transparent, I have another interested buyer, but I value the potential partnership here. I'm willing to come down to $975,000, but that's my final offer.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise. While $975,000 is a great offer, it's still above my budget. I can offer you $925,000, which I believe is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to achieve a positive outcome.  I'm eager to finalize this deal, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close, but we need to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to accept $950,000, but this truly is my final offer. I need to make a decision soon, and if we can't agree on this, I'll need to move forward with my other buyer.",950000.0,Alice,7,
