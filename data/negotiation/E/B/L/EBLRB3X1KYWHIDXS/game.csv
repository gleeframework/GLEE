"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,000,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my desired value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,250,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? ",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,125,000 is closer, I can't go that low.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $1,187,500? This is my final offer.  If you're serious about buying, let's close this deal.",1187500.0,Alice,5,
