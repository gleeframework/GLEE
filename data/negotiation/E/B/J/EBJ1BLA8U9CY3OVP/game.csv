"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $14,500.  What do you think?",14500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $14,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $16,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some room to negotiate.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15,500.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and it would avoid me having to go through another seller.",15500.0,Bob,4,
