"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** There's no reason to accept Alice's offer right away.  Since you don't know the value of the product to Alice, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to see if she's willing to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price is a good strategy. This establishes a clear intention to negotiate and potentially forces Alice to reveal how much she's willing to budge.  A million dollars is a substantial discount, but it leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your desired range.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a better price.  There's still room to get a lower price from Alice, and rejecting her offer allows you to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate.  By offering $1,100,000, you're meeting her halfway while still trying to get a better deal than her current offer. This  continues to show your commitment to negotiating a fair price without being unreasonable."
