"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price from Bob. If he rejects, I can always go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a good price, I can try to get more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob is offering $1,100,000, which is more than John's offer of $1,000,000.  It's time to accept and secure the deal."
