"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a range that might be reasonable for both of us. This is a strong starting point for negotiation.  I'm aiming to find a price that's a fair compromise, while still saving as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my budget, but it's closer to my maximum. I want to see if I can push her lower by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer.  If Alice continues to be inflexible, buying from John might be the best option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, but it's still significantly lower than Alice's current offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not going to accept an unreasonable price.  I'm aiming to find a price that's a fair compromise, and this counteroffer reflects that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely I'll be able to get her down to my desired price. At this point, buying from John for $1,000,000 is the most cost-effective and guaranteed way to get the product.  I'm willing to accept a slightly higher price to avoid further negotiation."
