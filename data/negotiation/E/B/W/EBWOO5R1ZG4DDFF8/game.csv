"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,025,000. Can you consider that?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price closer to $1,050,000. How about we settle on $1,040,000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.",1040000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,040,000. I'm willing to compromise again, but I can only go up to $1,015,000. Can you consider that?",1015000.0,Bob,6,
