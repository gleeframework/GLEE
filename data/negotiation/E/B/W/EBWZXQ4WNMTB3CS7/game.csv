"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget. While $900000 is tempting, it's not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1200000. This price still offers you significant value, and it's a fair compromise for both of us. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand where you're coming from, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1050000. Can you consider this compromise?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1050000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1150000 as a final offer. This price recognizes your budget while ensuring I can meet my own needs. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's make this deal happen.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
