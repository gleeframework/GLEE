Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below this threshold creates a sense of urgency and a perceived ""deal"" for Bob.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I have a safety net with John who will buy it at my desired minimum price, so I can afford to be slightly bolder with Bob.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  $14,999 feels significantly cheaper than $15,000 in the mind of the buyer, even though the difference is negligible."
