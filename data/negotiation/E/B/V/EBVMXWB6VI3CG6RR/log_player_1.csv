Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This allows room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit well above my minimum value.  I'll be prepared to lower the price slightly if Bob makes a counteroffer, but I won't go below my minimum value of $1,000,000.  If Bob doesn't come close to my asking price, I'll happily sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but still not quite where I want it to be.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,450,000.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer.  I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  At this point, the risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential gain.  I'm accepting his offer and closing the deal."
