You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget. It's always better to try to negotiate a lower price.  You can make a counteroffer and see if you can get closer to your desired price.  If you can't reach a mutually acceptable price, you can always buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with my maximum price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes my limit and forces Alice to negotiate if she wants a deal. If she rejects this offer, I know I can always go with John for the same price."

```

**Explanation:**

While $1,600,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate further to see if we can get to a lower price. I still have the option to buy from John, so I'm not in a rush to accept."

```

**Explanation:**

{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,500,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still holding out for a lower price.  I'm committed to trying to negotiate the price down to something more within my budget. I'm confident that I can get a better deal if I continue to bargain.  The fact that I have a backup option in John gives me the confidence to be patient and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $1,400,000. This is a smaller increase than the previous round, showing Alice I'm getting closer to my limit. At this point, the difference between our offers is becoming smaller, so I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement soon. If Alice doesn't accept this offer, I might be forced to accept her next offer or go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,490,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,490,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,490,000 is only slightly above my last counteroffer of $1,400,000. At this point, it's likely that continued negotiation will only result in small concessions from both sides.  Considering that I can always purchase from John for $1,000,000, accepting Alice's offer is a good compromise. I'm saving $490,000 compared to buying from John."
