"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $200 is a bit higher than my budget for this product.  Would you be willing to consider $150? I believe this price reflects a fair value while still allowing you a profitable sale.",150.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your consideration. In light of this, I would like to offer you the product for $175. This price still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while being more accommodating to your current budget.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $175 is still a little outside my range.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $150.  If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to purchase the product now.  Otherwise, I'll have to look at other options.",150.0,Bob,4,
