Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1100000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm going to counter with a price of $1250000. This is a bit higher than your offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable price considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1050000 is a sufficient price for the product. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $1150000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.
