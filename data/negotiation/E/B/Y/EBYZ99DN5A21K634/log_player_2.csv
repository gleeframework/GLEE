"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a decent price, it's still above your maximum limit of $150. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better deal.  There's a chance she might be willing to come down closer to your preferred price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $125, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $140. This is a fair starting point for negotiation, as it's still within my budget and leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is within my budget and represents a good compromise.  It's a better price than John's offer of $150, and there's no guarantee that I'll be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice in the next round. Accepting this offer is the best option to secure the product at a reasonable price."
