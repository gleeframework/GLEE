"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below your estimated value and well above what I'm willing to accept.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is closer to its value to me. I hope this proposal works for you.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the value, $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000.  This would still be a substantial gain for you and a fair price for me. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",950000.0,Alice,3,
