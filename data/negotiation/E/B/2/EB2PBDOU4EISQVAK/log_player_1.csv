Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is closer to its value to me. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000.  This would still be a substantial gain for you and a fair price for me. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 950000}
