"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this product for a very competitive price of $1,200,000.  It's a significant value for you, and I believe it will be a great asset to your operations. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than her perceived value, it's significantly more than your maximum budget of $800,000 and the guaranteed price from John. You have a better alternative available."
