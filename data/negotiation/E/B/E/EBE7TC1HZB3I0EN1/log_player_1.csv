"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial.  To start the conversation, I propose a price of $1,600,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  We start significantly above both our minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's eagerness. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and Bob's potential benefit, aiming to create a positive and collaborative negotiation atmosphere.
* **Open to Discussion:**  We end by inviting Bob's thoughts, encouraging him to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches our minimum acceptable price, we have room to negotiate. We started high, and it's unlikely Bob will walk away immediately. We'll aim for a price closer to his perceived value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet halfway and settle for $1,400,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product brings."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** We're making a significant concession from $1,600,000 to $1,400,000, signaling flexibility.  However, we're justifying this move by highlighting the compromise and reiterating the product's value.
* **Targeting Above Bob's Value:**  We're aiming for a price point above Bob's stated value ($1,000,000) but below our initial offer. This leaves room for further negotiation while still potentially securing a favorable deal.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** The language remains collaborative and respectful, fostering a continued dialogue with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now negotiating below our minimum acceptable price. However, we still have rounds to spare and want to see if we can push him a bit further. Rejecting this offer shows we're firm on our value but open to continued negotiation. We'll aim for a price closer to $1,200,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but that price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  We're now at our minimum acceptable price. By stating this is our final offer, we signal firmness and increase the pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Justifying the Price:** We reiterate that the offer represents the product's value and our lowest acceptable price.  
* **Creating Urgency:** By making it a ""final offer,"" we introduce a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision. 
* **Alternative Option:**  While we don't mention John explicitly, Bob is aware we have other options, further encouraging him to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're willing to make a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unwilling to meet our minimum price, even after we've stated it as our final offer.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better outcome. Selling to John guarantees us our desired profit and avoids further time and effort spent on an unsuccessful negotiation with Bob."
