However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,080,000 was a bit of a starting point, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,075,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer.

At this point, it's a good deal.  The price is reasonable, and it's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price."
