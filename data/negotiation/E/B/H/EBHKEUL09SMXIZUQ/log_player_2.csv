"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I believe a price of $14,500 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?"", 
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While I'm willing to pay up to $10,000, starting with a significantly lower offer gives me room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message expresses interest while making it clear that the initial price is not acceptable. 
* **Targeting a Good Deal:** Aiming for $8,000 allows me to potentially secure a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective. While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's counteroffer is a step in the right direction, but $13,000 is still significantly more than my $10,000 limit and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to negotiate suggests there might be more flexibility in the price. 
* **Alternative Option:** The option to buy from John for $10,000 provides leverage. I can use this to encourage Alice to move closer to my acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $13,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  Could you consider something closer to $9,500?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer but Holding Firm:**  Offering $9,500 demonstrates willingness to negotiate upwards while staying below my $10,000 limit.
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:**  This counteroffer will help me gauge how much further Alice is willing to lower her price. 
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to buy from John at $10,000 if Alice is not willing to meet me closer to my desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,250? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:** Even with the ""split the difference"" approach, $11,250 is still over my $10,000 budget.
* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, meaning further negotiation is unlikely.
* **John's Guarantee:**  I know I can get the product for $10,000 from John. It makes more sense to save the extra $1,250 and go with the guaranteed deal."
