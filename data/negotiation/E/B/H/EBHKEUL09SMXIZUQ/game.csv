"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective. While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $13,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  Could you consider something closer to $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,250? This is my final offer.",11250.0,Alice,5,
