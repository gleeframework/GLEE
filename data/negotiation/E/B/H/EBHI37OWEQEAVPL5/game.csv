"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than my minimum.  Let's work together to finalize this! ",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a fair price considering the value to you. Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $900,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more around $800,000.  Would that price point be feasible?",800000.0,Bob,4,
