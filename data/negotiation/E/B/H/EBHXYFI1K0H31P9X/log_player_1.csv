"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is too low and significantly below my minimum. It's not worth my time to negotiate further when I have a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price."
