"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to me. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""steal"" aspect, trying to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Leaving room for John:**  While I'm hopeful Bob will accept, I'm not giving away too much value upfront, leaving me flexibility if I need to turn to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.
* **Potential for better deal:** I have room to negotiate further and potentially get closer to my target of $1,000,000.
* **John's offer provides a safety net:**  If I can't get a better price from Bob, I can always fall back on John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is closer to my expectations, I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,100,000 for this product. How about we split the difference and go with $1,000,000?  It's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and justification:**  I'm proposing a compromise by meeting halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. I'm also providing a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing the ""win-win"" aspect.
* **Targeting John's offer:**  I'm aiming for the $1,000,000 mark, which is what John is offering. This increases the chances of a deal and avoids the risk of Bob walking away. 
* **Remaining firm:**  I'm not dropping my price too significantly, signaling that I'm still serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we go with $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob is getting closer to my minimum,  $950,000 is still below my target of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiating room:** I have one more round to try to get a better price from Bob.
* **John's offer is the safety net:** If I can't secure a better deal, I'll have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference one last time. How about $975,000? This is a fair compromise, and it's closer to the value I know this product holds. I'm confident we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:**  I'm offering a final compromise by meeting halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to me, hoping to make him reconsider.
* **Creating urgency:** I'm suggesting that this is my ""final"" offer, increasing pressure on Bob to accept.
* **John's offer as leverage:** I'm still holding onto John's offer, ready to walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about we go with $960,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  With only four rounds left, there's not much room for further negotiation.
* **Close to my minimum:**  While $960,000 is closer to my minimum of $1,000,000, it's still not a substantial enough improvement to risk losing John's guaranteed offer.
* **Guaranteed deal:** John's offer is a sure thing. It's not worth risking losing that deal for a small potential increase."
