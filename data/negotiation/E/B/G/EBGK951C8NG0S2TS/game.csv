"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $10,500 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference and settle for $11,000?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",11000.0,Alice,3,
