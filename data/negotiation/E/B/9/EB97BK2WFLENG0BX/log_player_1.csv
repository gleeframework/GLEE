Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider a price closer to $10,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $15,000 is already a very competitive price for this product.  To make it work, I could meet you halfway at $12,500. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 12500}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider one more compromise?

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
