"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is less than Bob's maximum, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation, so Bob should reject and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you be willing to come down to $8500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a reasonable counteroffer, showing that he's willing to negotiate while also aiming for a significant price reduction.  $8500 is a good starting point, as it leaves room for further negotiation while still being below Alice's value point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8800. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,800 is a good deal for Bob. It's below his maximum price of $10,000 and significantly lower than the initial offer. While further negotiation is possible, accepting now minimizes the risk of losing the deal and ending up paying John's higher price."
