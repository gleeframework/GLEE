Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 99}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $100, offering it to Bob at a slightly lower price increases the chances of a quicker sale and still earns a profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $99 is just below my guaranteed sale price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of urgency and potential bargain for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a firm offer, the slight markup from Bob's value leaves a tiny window for potential negotiation if he's a tough customer."
