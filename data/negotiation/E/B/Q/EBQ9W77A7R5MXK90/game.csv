"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $14,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer considering the value it brings.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to pay $9,000 for this product, given its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, however, $9,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
