"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $9,500 is still a little steep for me.  Could you do $8,750? That would work for me.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $9,125.  That's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",9125.0,Alice,5,
