"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its potential value. Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1100000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a reasonable middle ground. Let's work together to make this happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,
