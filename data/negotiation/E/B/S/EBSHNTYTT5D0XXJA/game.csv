,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value of the product, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000.  This reflects the unique value of this product and gives us both room for a good deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this price.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1500000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a profitable transaction for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
