Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a valuable product that I believe could be of great benefit to you.  I'm starting with an offer of $1,800,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value of the product, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.  This reflects the unique value of this product and gives us both room for a good deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1500000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a profitable transaction for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer more,  $1,250,000 is a good price, and it avoids the risk of going further with the negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower offer or having to sell to John for a lower price."
