"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for the product. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid I can't accept $60. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $90. This is still a great deal, considering its value to you is $80. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about $70? That's closer to what I had in mind.",70.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're getting closer to the value of the product to you. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $85. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,
