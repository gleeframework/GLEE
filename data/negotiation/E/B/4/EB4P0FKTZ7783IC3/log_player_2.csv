"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still possible to save money. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There's a chance she may be willing to go lower to secure the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $800,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal and hopefully encourages her to come down from her initial price. It's still within my budget and leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price considering my budget.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll reject my offer and I'll be stuck with the $1,000,000 price from John. It's better to lock in the $850,000 deal and save $150,000."
