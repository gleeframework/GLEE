Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:**  I need to make at least $12,000, as that's what John will pay.
* **Potential Upsell:**  Offering $14,000 gives me a potential profit of $2,000.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While a higher price might be tempting, the risk of Bob rejecting is increased. I'm balancing the potential for a larger profit with the risk of getting only the minimum price."
