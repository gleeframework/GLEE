You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'm not interested in paying $15,000 for the product. That's $3,000 more than what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject Alice's offer and see if I can get a better deal from John.
