"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll find it's well worth the investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This would allow for a good profit for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit higher than my target price.  How about $1,125,000? This feels like a fair price that respects both our needs.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit off your target price, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm getting closer to my goal. How about $1,100,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident that you'll be pleased with the final outcome.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,7,
