"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10000.  Would you be willing to consider that?  ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I can't go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still trying to get the price down a bit, but I'm willing to go up to $11000. Would you be willing to meet me there? ",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'm counteroffering at $11250. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",11250.0,Alice,5,
