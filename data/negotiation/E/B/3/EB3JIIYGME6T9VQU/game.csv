,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $100? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down Alice, but $100 is still a bit much for me.  How about $75? That's closer to the middle ground.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to compromise again and meet you at $90. That's the lowest I can go.",90.0,Alice,5,
