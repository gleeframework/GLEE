{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe you'd find very valuable. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $120 is more than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $150, so he has room to negotiate and still feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  This leaves room for both of you to negotiate further if needed. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below your desired profit margin.  You have room to negotiate further with Bob and hopefully get closer to your desired price.  Let's see if you can get a better deal!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is still above your minimum:** You're making a profit at $110.
* **Is closer to Bob's offer:** You're showing flexibility by moving closer to his offer.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  There's still a small gap between your offer and Bob's, allowing for further conversation."
