"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product,  $700,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm prepared to offer $650,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $675,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,3,
