"Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep for me.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $800,000.  This is the absolute maximum I can go, given my budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $800,000 is below my initial asking price, I understand your budgetary constraints. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this reflects its true value while acknowledging your feedback.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking to my original offer of $800,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's the maximum I can pay and still make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I respect your position and your willingness to work towards a deal.  Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $900,000. I believe this price represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the true value of the product.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
