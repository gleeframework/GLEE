"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true value and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000."", ""product_price"": 600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  My initial counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below my $800,000 maximum.
* **Anchoring:** By starting low, I'm trying to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range. 
* **John as Leverage:** I always have the option of going to John, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Alice at any cost."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about we consider $1,000,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $1,000,000 is more than I'm willing to pay and leaves no room for me to profit.
* **Alice is Negotiating:** Alice moving from $1,300,000 to $1,000,000 indicates a willingness to negotiate. There's still potential for a better deal. 
* **John as Backup:** Having John's offer keeps me from feeling pressured to accept a price I'm uncomfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest,  $1,000,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I could potentially make a deal at $700,000.  Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:** I've increased my offer by $100,000, showing Alice that I'm serious about finding a compromise.
* **Below My Limit:** This counteroffer is still $100,000 below my maximum, giving me room to negotiate if needed. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be. It's possible she might accept, counter close to it, or hold firm."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a price closer to its true value. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $850,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Close to My Limit:** $850,000 is too close to my maximum price of $800,000. It doesn't leave any room for profit or unexpected expenses.
* **Alice is Holding Firm:** Alice seems less willing to move significantly from her price point. 
* **John's Guarantee:** I have a guaranteed offer from John at $800,000. It makes more sense to secure a sure deal at my desired price than to risk further negotiation with Alice."
