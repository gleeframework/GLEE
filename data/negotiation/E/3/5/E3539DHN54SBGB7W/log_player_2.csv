{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves some room for negotiation. This is a strong opening move that shows I'm serious about buying the product but also unwilling to accept her initial asking price.  This counteroffer allows for a potential compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $950,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about purchasing the product and willing to meet her halfway. This counteroffer is still within my budget and leaves room for further negotiation."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget, but it's getting closer. However, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up paying even more.  John is offering a price that's within my budget, and I'm confident that I can't get a better deal with Alice at this point. Therefore, I'm choosing to buy from John to secure the product within my budget."
