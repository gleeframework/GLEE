"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $12500.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $12500. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a minimum of $14000 to make the deal worthwhile. I can offer you a slight discount, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. This is my final offer in this range.",14000.0,Alice,5,
