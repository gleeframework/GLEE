"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's desired maximum of $15,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is within Bob's budget of $15,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's possible Alice might not be willing to go lower. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price within his budget and avoids the risk of a breakdown in negotiations or having to buy from John for a higher price."
