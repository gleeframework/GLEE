"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $950,000. I would like to make a counteroffer of $875,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",875000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to be a bit flexible, but $875,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $910,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",910000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. While I respect the value you place on the product, I must stick to my budget. I am willing to increase my counteroffer to $890,000. This still leaves a reasonable margin for both of us.",890000.0,Bob,4,
