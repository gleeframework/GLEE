"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate down and still make a profit. I'm also keeping it positive and emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. I am willing to pay $140 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but it's closer to my value than my initial offer. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price. I have 8 rounds left to work with Bob, and I'm hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $140 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. This still allows me to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll get from this product."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I would like to suggest $150 as a compromise. This is the highest I can go while still saving money compared to buying from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to get a higher price, it's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and prevents me from having to sell to John at the same price, potentially saving time and effort."
