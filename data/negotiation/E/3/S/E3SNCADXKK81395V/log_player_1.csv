Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly remind Bob it's worth the investment without explicitly revealing your minimum price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""discuss further"" signals to Bob that you're open to negotiation, making him more likely to engage.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still maintaining a good chance of securing the sale with Bob."
