"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that will bring you significant returns. I'm willing to let it go for $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for this product. I believe it's a fair price, given the value I see in it. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value you'll be getting. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,200,000.  I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my own budget. What do you say?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stick with your initial offer, but I'm still not convinced that $1,200,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum requirements. How about we meet in the middle between my initial offer and your offer, at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I can reasonably afford. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is my final offer.  If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to look elsewhere for this product.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see that you're serious about acquiring this product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,300,000. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,400,000, which is my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. Let's meet in the middle one more time at $1,350,000, but this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
