"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.  Bob has 10 rounds to work with, and the option to buy from John for $800,000 acts as a safety net.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and try to get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his negotiation by offering a price that's significantly closer to his budget and a good middle ground between his maximum of $800,000 and Alice's initial offer of $900,000. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a fair deal.  By offering $850,000, Bob is hoping to secure a deal that benefits both parties while keeping his budget in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $880,000 is very close to Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. While he could potentially try to negotiate further, it's risky to continue the negotiation. There's a chance Alice might not budge, and Bob could end up paying more than he's comfortable with. It's safer to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that's still within his budget.  The potential for further negotiation doesn't outweigh the risk of losing the deal and having to pay $800,000 to John."
