"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8500. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate you meeting me halfway, $9250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $8750?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8750. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9000. I think the product's value is worth it, and I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $9100? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",9100.0,Alice,5,
