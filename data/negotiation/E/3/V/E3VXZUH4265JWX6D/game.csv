"I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for this product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,16000.0
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",16000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal now.",12000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16,000 and $12,000, which is $14,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value.",14000.0,Alice,5,,
