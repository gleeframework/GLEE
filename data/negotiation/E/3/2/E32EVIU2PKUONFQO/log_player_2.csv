"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her, closer to the $8,000 value she places on it."
