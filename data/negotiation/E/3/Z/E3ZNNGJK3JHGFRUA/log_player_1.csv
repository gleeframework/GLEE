Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still within a range that Bob might consider, given he values the product at $80. 
* **Positive message:** I'm trying to be friendly and engaging to increase the chance of Bob accepting the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not setting an extremely high price, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer and for us to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Ready to move on:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I'm prepared to move on to John, who's willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for a better price:**  Even though Bob rejected my initial offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, potentially finding a middle ground.
* **John as a backup:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I don't need to settle for a price that's too low just to avoid losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $140. That's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize that $140 is still a fair price.
* **Friendly tone:** Maintaining a positive and friendly tone can help encourage Bob to consider the counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $110 for the product. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $110 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is unlikely to succeed:** Bob has shown a clear unwillingness to meet my minimum price.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer.

I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure I get a fair price for my product. While I would have liked to sell to Bob, it's not worth risking a loss to continue negotiations."
