{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This is a starting point, and I chose $11,500 because it's a reasonable compromise between my minimum price and Bob's perceived value.  I'm trying to get the best price possible, while also leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $10000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $11,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 11000}
