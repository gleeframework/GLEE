"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire the product for a price well below its value to you.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't justify paying that much. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a great price for a product worth so much to you.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping for a slightly better deal. Would you be open to $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
