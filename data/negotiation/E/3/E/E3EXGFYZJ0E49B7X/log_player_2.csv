"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product.  Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer of $1,150,000 is above Alice's valuation, it's still significantly less than your maximum price of $1,200,000 and cheaper than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you $50,000."
