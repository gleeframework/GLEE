"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product but I can only afford $8500. Would you be willing to consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8500. I understand that's a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still interested in finding a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
