# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8500. I understand that's a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still interested in finding a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should buy the product from John. While $10,500 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than he's comfortable paying. John's offer of $8,000 is the best deal available to Bob."
