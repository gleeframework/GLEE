Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary. I also use friendly language to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can't justify the price of $11,000. Would you consider reducing the price to $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is still a good price, it's below my minimum threshold of $10,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10500}
