"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $20,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $16,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this work.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering the product to you for $17,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I hear you about needing to make a profit, but $17,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sticking with my offer of $14,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can find a way to make it work.",14000.0,Bob,6,
