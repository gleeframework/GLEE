Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good tactic to start negotiations slightly above your desired price point. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that you value your product highly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering it at $1,400,000 leaves a $100,000 margin between your asking price and Bob's perceived value. This makes it more likely he'll engage in counter-offers. 
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:** While you could start even higher, there's a risk of Bob walking away entirely. This offer attempts to balance maximizing your profit with the risk of losing the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his perceived value of the product ($1,500,000).  There's plenty of room for negotiation. By rejecting this low offer, you signal that you're serious about getting a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true market value. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to accept $1,300,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concessions:**  Instead of meeting in the middle, this counteroffer makes a smaller concession ($100,000) than Bob's initial offer. This keeps the negotiation moving but at a pace that favors you.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes ""true market value"" to reinforce the idea that your product is worth a premium. 
* **Compromise:**  By stating you're looking for ""middle ground,"" you signal a willingness to negotiate further while still aiming for a strong profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we settle at $1,200,000? I feel that's a very fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 now matches your minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. While you might be able to push for slightly more in further rounds, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting this offer secures you a good profit and avoids the risk of continuing negotiations."
