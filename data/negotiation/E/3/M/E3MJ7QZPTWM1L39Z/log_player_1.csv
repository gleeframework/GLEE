Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. Please let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer price of $1,100,000 is:
    *  Above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) creating room for negotiation.
    * Below our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) ensuring we still make a profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message is phrased to encourage a counter-offer from Bob, allowing us to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have the security of John's offer, ensuring we don't lose out."
