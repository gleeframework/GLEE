Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000 is a starting point.**  It's higher than John's offer, giving me a chance to make a profit.
* **It's not too high.** I don't want to scare Bob off immediately, as I don't know how much he values the product.
* **I'm willing to negotiate.**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to lower the price slightly to see if I can still secure a better deal than John's offer."
