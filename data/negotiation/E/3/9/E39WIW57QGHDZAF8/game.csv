"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $12000. Let's make this deal happen.",12000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue working with you, but $11500 is still just a bit too low. How about $11750?  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",11750.0,Alice,5,
