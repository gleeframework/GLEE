I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000.  This gives me a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's important to try and maximize my profits while still being open to a deal.  Let's see what Bob's reaction is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's a significant improvement from his initial rejection, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $1,700,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,600,000 is a good amount and significantly better than selling to John.  It's time to finalize the deal!"
