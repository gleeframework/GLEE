"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It makes sense to reject and counteroffer to try and get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  A counteroffer of $8,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and leaves room for negotiation.  It's a reasonable starting point, considering Bob's maximum budget of $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's desired price.  Bob wants to try and negotiate further to see if he can get closer to his maximum budget before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget, but still wants to save some money.  This counteroffer is a compromise,  offering a price closer to Alice's last offer but still below Bob's maximum.  This demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while maintaining a firm stance on his budget."
