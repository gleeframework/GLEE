"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than John's offer of $15,000.  While Bob could get it for $12,000 if he negotiated further with Alice, it's still a better deal than paying $15,000."
