Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential returns it offers. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob first could yield a better outcome.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting at $1,100,000 creates room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Exclusive Opportunity:**  Positioning the offer as ""exclusive"" adds a psychological element that might make Bob more inclined to accept.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes some flexibility on your part. If Bob counters, you have room to negotiate down towards $1,200,000, ensuring you still meet your minimum. 
* There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, since you have John as a backup, this strategy offers a higher potential profit ceiling."
