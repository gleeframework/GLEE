Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 115}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to counteroffer at $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, however, the product is worth a bit more to me than that. How about $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's value to both of us, I would like to counteroffer at $105 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is now offering $105, which is more than John's offer. While we could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk Bob might walk away in later rounds. Accepting now secures a profit above our minimum."
