# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still gives you a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a more comfortable price point for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I propose $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price that still gives you a good deal, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Alice has reached her minimum price.  There's no point in further negotiation, and $800,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer."
