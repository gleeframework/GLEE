"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm compensated fairly.  I'm proposing a price of $10,500.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
