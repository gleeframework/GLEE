"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $90. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this is a great deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. By rejecting Alice's offer, you push her to potentially offer a lower price. If she doesn't offer a better deal, you can always buy from John for $100."
