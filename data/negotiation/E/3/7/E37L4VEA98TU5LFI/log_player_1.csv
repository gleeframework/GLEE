"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but not too far above Bob's perceived value ($100).  This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential benefit to Bob. 
* **First Offer:**  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe I can offer you $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **No Risk:** There's no reason to risk further negotiation.  I've secured a good price, and there's no guarantee that I can get more.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 10 rounds, it's wise to accept a reasonable offer rather than risk a stalemate."
