# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to do business together. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
