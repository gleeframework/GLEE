"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $18000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $14000?  I think that's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $15500.  This would be a good deal for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm still not sure if $15500 is enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",16250.0,Alice,5,
