"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within a specific budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value the product at a higher amount, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise, but I'm confident this price still represents a good value for you. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is a good price for Bob.  This is still significantly less than buying from John for $1,500,000. While Bob might be able to squeeze out a little more, the risk of Alice walking away or further negotiations taking too long is high.  Accepting the offer is the most sensible move at this point."
