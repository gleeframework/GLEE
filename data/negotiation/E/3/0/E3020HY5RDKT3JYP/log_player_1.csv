Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at a price that's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Value to Bob:**  I'm acknowledging the product's value to Bob, which can help him see the potential benefit of buying from me.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I've included a message that shows I'm open to discussing the price. 
* **John as Backup:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within a specific budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is my minimum, but I can still try to get a better price.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob acknowledges the product's value and is open to finding a price that works for both of us.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is a safe option, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $1,250,000 or higher.  

I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can find a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value the product at a higher amount, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise, but I'm confident this price still represents a good value for you. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by moving down from my previous offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm still emphasizing the value the product brings to Bob, making it clear that this price is still a good deal.
* **Finality:**  I'm hinting at wanting to finalize the deal, creating a sense of urgency. 

This counteroffer offers a middle ground that could potentially lead to a successful negotiation."
