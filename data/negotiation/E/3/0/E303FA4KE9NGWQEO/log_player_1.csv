{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. My starting offer is $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a fair deal. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I think I can get closer to my desired price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $9,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Can you consider $9,000? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $9,000 is a good price considering the value of the product to me and the fact that John is only offering $8,000. It's better to secure a sale now than risk a lower price in the future."
