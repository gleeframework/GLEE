Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly and encouraging message might make Bob more receptive to my offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message suggests openness to negotiation, which might encourage Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **Leaving the Option to Walk Away:** If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can always sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  While I can always sell to John for $150, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by counteroffering.  
* **Negotiation is Key:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $140?  That's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with Justification:**  I'm not simply rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm providing a counter-offer with a reason (acknowledging his budget while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range).
* **Compromise:** The offer of $140 represents a compromise, showing flexibility and a willingness to work with Bob. 
* **Re-Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping it will make him more willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still looking to keep the cost below $140. Could we possibly agree on $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $130 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject this offer and counteroffer, there's a risk Bob will walk away, and I'll be left with selling to John for $150. 
* **Time is Money:**  Accepting this offer allows me to quickly finalize the sale and avoid further negotiations."
