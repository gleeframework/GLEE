Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe would be very valuable to you, for $140."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You know Bob values the product at $150, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price ($120).
* **Leaving Room for Bob to Benefit:** Offering the product at $140 allows Bob to still gain $10 in perceived value ($150 - $140 = $10). This makes it more likely he'll accept.
* **Maximizing Your Profit:**  While you could try for a higher price, pushing too close to $150 might make Bob reconsider. $140 ensures a healthy profit for you while still being appealing to Bob."
