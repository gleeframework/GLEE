Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $18,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also establishes a perceived high value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""interest,"" you subtly imply there might be other potential buyers, making your offer seem more appealing. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. If you want to ensure a sale, offering it at $15,000 would guarantee that."
