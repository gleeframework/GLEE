Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 creates a few advantages:
    * **Attractive to Bob:** It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), but there's room for negotiation.
    * **Potential for Higher Profit:**  If Bob accepts, you earn $350,000 more than selling to John.
    * **Time Pressure:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. However, don't go below $1,500,000 since you have John as a guaranteed buyer."
