For this unique opportunity, I am offering the product at a special introductory price of $120. Please let me know if this aligns with your expectations.

You have three options:

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $120 for the product, and John is selling it for exactly that amount, there's no need to negotiate with Alice.  There's no chance of getting a better deal."
