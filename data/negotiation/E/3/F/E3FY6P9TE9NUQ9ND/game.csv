"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to part with it for. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000, my final offer.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $1,025,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
