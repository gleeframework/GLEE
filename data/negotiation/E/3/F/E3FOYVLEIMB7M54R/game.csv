"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you consider that?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $145?  Let's make this happen.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $120 is a bit low, but $145 is still a bit high for me. How about we try $130? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $130 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little more.  How about $140? This is my final offer, so let's make this happen.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $140, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $140, so how about $135? That's the best I can do.",135.0,Bob,6,
