"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. This price still reflects the product's value, but I'm willing to meet you halfway to reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, Alice.  How about we split the difference from our last offers? I could do $775,000.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $775,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $825,000. This price is closer to my original offer, but I'm still willing to meet you halfway to reach an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  To make this move along, I'm willing to bump my offer up to $800,000.  That's a significant investment for me, but I do see value in the product.",800000.0,Bob,6,
