"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product.  This price is fair given the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, but I want to maximize my profit if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price is still fair considering the product's value to you.  Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to offer you $1150000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, his offer of $1,150,000 is still below my desired price. I have several rounds left, and I believe I can potentially get a better offer. Selling to John would guarantee me $1,200,000, but I want to maximize my profit if possible."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
