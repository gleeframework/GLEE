"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. I'm confident it can greatly benefit you.  Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is simply too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the offer of $600,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant value it will bring to your operations.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart on price.  I understand its value, but I need to be realistic about what I can afford.  Would you consider $700,000?  I think that's a fair jump from my previous offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations that's proving hard to bridge.  To be transparent, I have another buyer interested at a significantly higher price. However, I value our discussions and believe this product can be a great asset for you. I'm willing to make a substantial move to $1,600,000.  Let's see if we can find an agreement quickly.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. To be frank, I have other options for this purchase. I can offer you $800,000, which is my final offer. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore those other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
