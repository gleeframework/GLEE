{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward, while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong but Respectful Language:** The message aims to be persuasive without being overly aggressive. 

By offering the product at $1,350,000, Alice leaves herself room to potentially negotiate down to a price that's still significantly higher than John's offer while attempting to maximize her profit from Bob."
