Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its true worth while also staying within my financial limits. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm interested in selling, $10,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,500 for the product. This price aligns better with my budget while still acknowledging the value of your product. I hope we can reach a mutually agreeable solution.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to sell for that low. I'll try to negotiate further in the next round, but I'm also considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $11,250.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your continued negotiation efforts. I've reviewed my budget again, and I'd like to counter with an offer of $11,000 for the product. I believe this price strikes a balance between respecting the value of your product and staying within my financial constraints. I hope this offer will be acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, $11,000 is a decent offer and it seems like Bob won't go higher. I'm satisfied with this deal and don't want to risk losing him completely or having to sell to John at a lower profit."
