"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget in mind.  I'd be willing to offer $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer. However, $600,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product offers a unique value proposition and has the potential to generate significant returns. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $950,000? This would represent a fair compromise, considering its true worth.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value this product offers, but $950,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable paying.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle at $725,000? This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the product's value.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for staying with me in this negotiation.  I can tell you're serious. While $725,000 is closer to a realistic price, it's still a significant gap from what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $875,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value this product brings.",875000.0,Alice,5,
