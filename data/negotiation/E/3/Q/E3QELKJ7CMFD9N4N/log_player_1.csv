Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget in mind.  I'd be willing to offer $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While I want to find a deal that works for both of us, $600,000 is significantly below my minimum.  It's time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer. However, $600,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product offers a unique value proposition and has the potential to generate significant returns. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $950,000? This would represent a fair compromise, considering its true worth."",
 ""product_price"": 950000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the value this product offers, but $950,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable paying.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle at $725,000? This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is getting closer, but $725,000 is still too far from my minimum. I need to hold firm and see if I can negotiate him up further.  I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, thanks for staying with me in this negotiation.  I can tell you're serious. While $725,000 is closer to a realistic price, it's still a significant gap from what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $875,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value this product brings."",
