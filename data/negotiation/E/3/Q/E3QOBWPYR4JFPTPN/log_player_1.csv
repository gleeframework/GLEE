Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,800,000. Let me know your decision - this offer won't last long!"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer in John, my goal is to maximize profit. Bob represents a chance to significantly exceed the $1,000,000 baseline.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a high offer of $1,800,000 sets an ambitious anchor point. Even if Bob negotiates down, the final price is likely to be higher than if I started lower.
* **Scarcity:** By implying the offer is time-sensitive, I create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly. 

**Important Note:**  This is a bold opening strategy.  It's based on the assumption that I have some leverage (perhaps the product's uniqueness or Bob's strong desire to acquire it). There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright, but the potential reward justifies the gamble."
