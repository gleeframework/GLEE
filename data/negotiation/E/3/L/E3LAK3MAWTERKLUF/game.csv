"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $1,800,000 is closer to what you're thinking, it doesn't fully reflect the unique value this product offers. To move things forward, I'm proposing $2,100,000. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has unique value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,900,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, calling $1,900,000 your 'final offer' so early in the discussion doesn't give us much room to work. I've done my research, and I know the true value of this product is significantly higher. To show you I'm serious about getting this done, I'm willing to come down to $2,050,000.  This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it represents a truly fair deal.",2050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but I still think $2,050,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,900,000. However, I'd like to make a new proposal: I'll pay the full $1,900,000, but I'd like you to throw in some additional support or services to sweeten the deal. Perhaps some training or maintenance services to help me get the most out of the product?",1900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire for additional support, but I'm confident the product stands strong on its own merit. Instead of adding complexity, let's focus on finding a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to consider a slight adjustment to $2,025,000.  This keeps the value intact while acknowledging your position. How does that sound?",2025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, but I'm still not convinced $2,025,000 is the right number. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $1,900,000. However, I'd like to make a new proposal: I'll pay the full $1,900,000, but I'd like you to throw in some additional concessions, such as a warranty or a maintenance contract, to make the deal more attractive. If you're willing to do that, I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Bob,8,
