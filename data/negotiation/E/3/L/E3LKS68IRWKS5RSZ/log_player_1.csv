Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know John will buy for $1,200,000, our guaranteed minimum.  Our goal is to get more from Bob if possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **High but Understandable:** This price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but not so high as to be insulting or immediately dismissed. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept even with negotiation. Our strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and avoiding a guaranteed sale to John at our minimum acceptable price."
