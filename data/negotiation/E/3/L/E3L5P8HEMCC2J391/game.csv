"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do  $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,300,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value it brings.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
