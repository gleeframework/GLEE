"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concern about the price, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product and I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle. However, $900,000 is still a bit above what I had in mind. Could you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised a lot by offering $900,000. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is close, but I think I can only justify $800,000.  This is my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, Bob, but I've already compromised a lot and I don't think I can go any lower than $850,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you at that price, but I'm not willing to go any lower. It's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",850000.0,Alice,7,
