"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth significantly more to you. Let's get this deal closed!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your product is worth $800,000 to you, so I would like to propose a price of $750,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, or at least secure my minimum acceptable price. Selling to John right now would be settling for less than I could potentially get from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit too low. Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Based on our previous discussions, I think a fair price for your product would be $850,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and is a good deal for me.  While I could potentially get more by continuing to negotiate, there's no guarantee I'll reach a higher price with Bob, and I risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of losing out on a sale."
