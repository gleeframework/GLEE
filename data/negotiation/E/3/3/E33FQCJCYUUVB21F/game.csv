"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we bring the price down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is still a great price considering the product's value, and it gives us both a chance to make a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're making concessions, but that price is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price. However, $700,000 still falls short of what's needed for this deal to work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. This reflects the value of the product while giving you a significant discount. Let's find a solution that benefits us both.",900000.0,Alice,5,
