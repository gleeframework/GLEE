"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit.  Since Bob values the product at $10,000, I know he's unlikely to accept this price immediately, but it sets the stage for negotiation. I'm leaving room to drop the price later if needed, but I want to see how willing he is to bargain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I believe I can get closer to my goal with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $16,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's last offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground while keeping in mind my minimum goal of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my goal, I'm not ready to settle for a price below $15,000 just yet. I'm confident that with continued negotiation, I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $15,500. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum goal of $15,000. I'm hoping this offer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  While I'm still a bit short of my ideal price,  I'm getting closer to my minimum goal of $15,000.  Considering the limited number of rounds left and the likelihood of continued negotiation, I don't want to risk dropping the price further.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum acceptable price."
