"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for this incredible product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle on $950,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
