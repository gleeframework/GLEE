Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for this incredible product. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering you a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,000,000, and you're better off securing the product at your target price."
