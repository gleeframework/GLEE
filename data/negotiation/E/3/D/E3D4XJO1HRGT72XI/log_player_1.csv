Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a valuable asset that I know will be a great investment for you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm not in a rush to sell, and I have the option of selling to John for the same price. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. Considering the value of this product for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $1,300,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still not at a point where I'm willing to accept it. I want to see if I can push him a little higher. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm not in a rush to sell, so I can afford to be patient.  It's likely that we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price point. However,  $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This would give us both a good deal and allow us to finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal for me. Bob has met my previous counteroffer at $1,300,000, which is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  There are only 4 rounds left, and I'm confident that I won't be able to get a better offer from Bob. It's time to close the deal and secure this profit."
