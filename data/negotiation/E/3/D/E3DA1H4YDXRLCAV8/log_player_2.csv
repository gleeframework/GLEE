"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. It's an exceptional opportunity tailored to meet your needs and expectations. Given its value to you, we believe it's worth $12,000. However, to facilitate a smoother transaction and considering the current market conditions, I'm offering it to you at a special introductory price of $10,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your budget and preferences. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is better than John's price of $12,000, Bob can still do better.  He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room to negotiate further. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get Alice to lower her price even more."
