Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $10,000 for it.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth it to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive tone (""fantastic,"" ""great deal"") aims to build rapport and create a sense of value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not being overly aggressive by immediately stating it's a ""final offer,"" leaving room for Bob to counter. 

**Important Considerations:**

* I'm aware that this is a high starting point and may be rejected. 
* I'm ready to negotiate based on Bob's response and have a backup plan with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $7500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Potential for a higher offer:** I believe I can get a better price from Bob through further negotiation.

**Next Step:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum.  I'll aim to find a compromise that is mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $7,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  This allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering with a price that is a compromise between my minimum ($8,000) and Bob's offer ($7,500).
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a way for both of us to get a good deal, emphasizing that we're both looking for a win-win situation.
* **Open Ended:** By asking ""What do you think?"", I'm leaving room for further negotiation and showing flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $8250?  This would be a fair price for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,250 is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Compromise:** It's a fair compromise, splitting the difference between my last offer and his. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject his offer, I risk him walking away completely, and I'm not guaranteed a better deal with John.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice in this situation, as it secures a sale above my minimum and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
