Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. It's also a significant amount above my minimum value, so I'm comfortable with the outcome if he rejects and I have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum value, but I believe I can still get more by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still seeking a price higher than Bob's initial offer. It's also a good midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit below what I initially hoped for, it's a decent amount above my minimum value and closer to my counteroffer. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of rejecting and ending up with John's offer is too high."
