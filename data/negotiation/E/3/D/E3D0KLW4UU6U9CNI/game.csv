"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, I'm not quite ready to commit to your asking price.  I'd be willing to offer $1200000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value is worth a premium. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you believe in the product's value, but $1600000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1300000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the product's potential. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a compromise at $1450000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,5,
