{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love! I'm willing to offer it to you for $135.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** $135. This is a price point that is higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and upbeat,  creating a positive tone for the negotiation.  It also highlights the value of the product to pique Bob's interest. 

**Strategy:**

* This initial offer allows me to test the waters and see if Bob is willing to pay more than his initial valuation. 
* If Bob rejects, I can use his counteroffer to gauge his seriousness and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* By offering a price above my minimum ($150), I show that I am flexible and willing to negotiate. 

**Note:**  This is just the first offer. I'll be ready to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response to maximize my profit!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

* By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my commitment to getting a fair price for the product. 
* I can now make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point, giving Bob an opportunity to compromise.
* This approach shows Bob that I am not simply accepting the first offer, which might make him more willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you. However, $125 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  Would you consider $130? It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product. "", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:**  $130. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $135, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to drop below a certain point.
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's offer while reiterating the value of the product. It also emphasizes the compromise I'm making, which can encourage Bob to reciprocate.

**Strategy:**

* By offering a counteroffer, I keep the negotiation going and maintain leverage.
* The counteroffer is close enough to Bob's last offer to show a willingness to meet halfway.
* This move also signals that I'm not desperate for a sale and that I believe the product is worth more than Bob's current offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this offer, I've successfully negotiated a higher price than his initial offer.
* If he rejects, I'll analyze his next counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still not comfortable with $130. Would you be willing to meet me at $125 again? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has stubbornly stuck to his $125 offer, even after my counteroffer. This shows that he's unlikely to budge further, and I'm at risk of wasting more time in negotiations.  Since my minimum acceptable price is $150, it's more efficient to sell to John and secure a guaranteed profit.

**Strategy:**

* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to a long and frustrating process with no guarantee of a better offer.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a higher profit than what Bob is offering.
* **Shifting Focus:** This decision allows me to move on to other potential buyers or opportunities. 

By choosing to sell to John, I prioritize maximizing my profit and minimizing the risk of a drawn-out negotiation."
