Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) to give myself some room to negotiate.  I'm also aiming for a price that's reasonable enough that Bob might be willing to pay it, but still leaves me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm hoping that I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $105? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm offering a price that's slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum price. I'm hoping this compromise will encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100. Accepting this offer ensures I make a profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
