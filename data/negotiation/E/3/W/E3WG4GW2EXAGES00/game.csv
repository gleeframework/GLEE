"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this is a fair price that allows me to make a good profit while still leaving you with a great deal.  What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'd like to get a better deal. Can you meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a great value for you considering the product's worth. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",115.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there yet. $115 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make one final compromise.  I'll meet you halfway at $120. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",120.0,Alice,5,
