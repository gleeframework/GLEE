Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price is $12,000:**  This is my fallback option if Bob rejects the offer.
* **I want to maximize my profit:** Aiming for a higher price than my minimum gives me a chance to earn more.
* **I don't know Bob's valuation:**  Offering a price slightly higher than my minimum allows for some negotiation room.

By offering $15,000, I'm taking a calculated risk. It's possible Bob will find the price too high and reject the offer. However, there's also a chance he values the product more than $15,000 and will accept. This strategy gives me the best chance of getting the highest possible price while still having a secure fallback option."
