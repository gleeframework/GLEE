"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, it's still more than Alice's perceived value of the product. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate.  It also leaves some room for Alice to counter without feeling like she's getting a raw deal.  The price is still well within Bob's budget and significantly above Alice's minimum value, so there's a strong chance she will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still not as low as Bob wants. It's worth taking another round of negotiation to see if Alice can come down further.  A counteroffer will likely get a lower price, and even if it doesn't, it keeps the pressure on Alice to make a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking with a slightly higher price than his previous counteroffer, showing that he is serious about buying the product but still wants a good deal.  This price is likely acceptable to Alice, as it's closer to her desired price point.  If she rejects this offer, Bob can consider buying from John, but it is likely she will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price.  While Bob could try to get a lower price, it's unlikely Alice will budge further.  At this point, accepting the offer is the best choice for Bob. He is getting the product for a price well below his maximum budget and  only slightly higher than his previous counteroffer.  It's a good deal and worth closing."
