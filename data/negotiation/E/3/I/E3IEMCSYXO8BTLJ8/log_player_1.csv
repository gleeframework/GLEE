"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving some room for negotiation. This shows I'm confident in the product's worth while also being open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is more than my minimum, it's still significantly below the value I know the product holds. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, showing I'm willing to compromise.  However, I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to the middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'm only 4 rounds into the negotiation and the deal is still within range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway with this offer.  We're now at a point where I'm getting closer to my minimum, and  the next few rounds will be crucial to determine if a deal is possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is close to my minimum, I'm still only a few rounds away from selling to John for $10,000. It's worth trying to get a slightly higher price from Bob, especially since we've already reached a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm offering $11,000, splitting the difference between Bob's last offer and my minimum goal. This is a strong final offer that shows my willingness to compromise while still securing a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm happy to get my minimum value of $10,000, I'm running out of time and negotiation rounds. It's wiser to secure the guaranteed sale with John rather than risk a further stalemate with Bob."
