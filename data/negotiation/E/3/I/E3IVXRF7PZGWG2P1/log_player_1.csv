This offer leaves a good amount of room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit significantly higher than my minimum threshold of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than the value I believe the product holds. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000,  which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $1,175,000 is still lower than my initial asking price, it's a reasonable compromise and significantly higher than selling to John. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and secure the sale."
