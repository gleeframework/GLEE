"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John, but there's room for improvement.** You can get the product for less than $11,500.
* **Negotiation is worth trying.** By rejecting the offer, you can try to push Alice closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm offering Alice $10,500, which is halfway between her value of $10,000 and my maximum of $12,000.
* **Reasonable expectation:**  Alice is likely to counter with something higher, but this offer shows I'm serious about negotiating and willing to pay a fair price.
* **Strategic advantage:** By making a counteroffer, I'm keeping the negotiation process open and potentially getting a better price than John's $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to my maximum.**  $11,700 is only $300 more than my maximum of $12,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will walk away, and I'll have to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Time is money:**  The negotiation process takes time, and it's likely that the time spent negotiating could be better spent elsewhere.

At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice. It's a good deal, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential delays."
