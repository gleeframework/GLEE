Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this is a fair price, as it is well below what the product is worth to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm countering with $110. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $105. While I would have preferred a higher price, this is still a good deal for me. It's significantly better than selling to John, and it seems like Bob is unlikely to increase his offer further."
