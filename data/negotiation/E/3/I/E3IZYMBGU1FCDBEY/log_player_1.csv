I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum price but leaves room for negotiation."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a price of $175. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum price.  Since I can sell to John for $150, I'll choose to do that."
