Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $98. I can offer you the product for $101. It's a slight adjustment, but I think it's still a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101.

Alice is clearly comfortable negotiating in very small increments. While I could try to push for $100, there's a chance the negotiation could stall, leaving me to buy from John at $120. Accepting $101 secures a reasonable deal."
