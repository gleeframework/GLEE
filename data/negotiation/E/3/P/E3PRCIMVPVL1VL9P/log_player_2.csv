You have three options:

It's not a good deal for Bob to accept $14,000 when he can buy the product from John for $8,000. It's better to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, but $8500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering you the product for $13000. This is the lowest I can go while still making it worth my while.

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Bob should reject this offer and continue negotiating to try and get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $9,500?  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling like we got a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $9500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering you the product for $11000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While Alice has come down further, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  Since Bob can get the product from John for $8,000, it's a better decision to buy from John."
