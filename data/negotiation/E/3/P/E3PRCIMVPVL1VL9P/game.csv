"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider it. However, I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and your asking price. Let me know your thoughts.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, but $8500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering you the product for $13000. This is the lowest I can go while still making it worth my while.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $9500?  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling like we got a good deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $9500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering you the product for $11000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
