"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  This initial offer is aggressive, but I'm willing to lower the price if necessary to close the deal within the 10 rounds. I also have the safety net of John's offer at $15,000, so I'm not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $18,000 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a lower price, but still above John's offer. I have 8 rounds left, and I think there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show some flexibility but still holding out for a higher price than Bob's offer. This counteroffer is a good compromise and hopefully will be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm worried that if I reject this, he might counter with something lower or we'll run out of rounds.  While I'd prefer a bit more, this is a safe deal and secures a decent profit."
