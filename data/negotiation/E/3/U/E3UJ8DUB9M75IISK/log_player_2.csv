"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product. Alice's offer of $950,000 is lower than your maximum price, but you can get it for $1,000,000 from John.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John will save you $50,000."
