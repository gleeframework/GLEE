Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still earning more than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so you're leaving some room for negotiation.
* **It's a strong opening:** You're showing confidence in the value of your product without being unreasonable. 

You can always adjust the price based on Bob's response. If he counters with a lower offer, you can either accept or counter again. Remember, your goal is to maximize your earnings, but also to close the deal with a buyer who values the product."
