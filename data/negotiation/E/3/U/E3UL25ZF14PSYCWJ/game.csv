"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget, but $80 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $130 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $95? That would be a great deal for me.",95.0,Bob,4,
