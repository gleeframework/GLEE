"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $5,500?",5500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $5,500 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a budget in mind.  Could we try for $7,000? That's a significant price jump from my previous offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,500.  This is a significant discount from my previous offer and I believe it's fair given the product's value.",8500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,750. This shows I'm serious about buying, but I also need to stay within a reasonable budget.",7750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your increasing offers, $7,750 is still below my acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,125.  This is my final offer, and it reflects a fair value for the product considering its worth.",8125.0,Alice,7,
