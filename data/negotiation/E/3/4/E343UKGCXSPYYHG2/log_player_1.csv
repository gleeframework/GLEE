Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think it would be perfect for you, and this is a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a little higher than Bob's perceived value ($100). This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Close to Your Minimum:** The price of $140 is very close to your minimum acceptable price ($150), maximizing your potential profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By presenting it as a ""special price"" and a ""great deal,"" you subtly encourage Bob to act quickly before he misses out. 
 
This strategy aims to get you the best possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
