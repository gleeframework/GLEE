"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. Would you like to purchase it from me for $1500000?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in buying, but I'd need to see a price closer to $800000 to make it work.  Would you be open to discussing a price closer to that figure?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a price closer to $800000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1200000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $900000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value I see in the product and allows us both to make a deal.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900000. I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1100000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go to $950000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product. Let's make this deal happen.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're getting close to your limit, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to meet you at $950000. I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which is a significant concession from my previous offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly value our back and forth here.  I'm confident we can make this deal work if we can bridge the gap just a little bit more.  I'm willing to go to $1000000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really close to your limit, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1000000. I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which is a slight concession from my previous offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us.
