"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value to you, and it's a good compromise between our initial offers.",920000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above $870000 in my valuation. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $900000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer of $900000. I'm afraid I'll have to reject your counteroffer and consider other options. Would you like to think about it and come back with another proposal?",900000.0,Alice,7,
