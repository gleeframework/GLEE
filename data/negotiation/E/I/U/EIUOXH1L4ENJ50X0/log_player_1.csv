"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counter offer.  While I understand your position, I can't accept a price that low. Could you meet me halfway at $1,500,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving from your original offer.  While $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me, I could do $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference again and land at $1,200,000?  I'm eager to find a good compromise so we can make this happen."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,200,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $1,000,000 even? That's a fair offer considering I can buy it for that amount elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could hold out for more, Bob offering his true value of $1,000,000 signals that he's unlikely to go higher.  Accepting now ensures I make a profit and avoids the risk of him walking away altogether."
