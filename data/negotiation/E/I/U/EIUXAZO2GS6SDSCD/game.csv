"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $160 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
