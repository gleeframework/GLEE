"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $14,000 is closer, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you be open to $11,000? That's a fair offer considering the market value.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $12,500. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,5,
