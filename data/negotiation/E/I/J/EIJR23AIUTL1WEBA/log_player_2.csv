"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the return you'll get. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is better than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is still fair given its value, and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $950,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This allows us both to walk away with a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $900,000, which is still a good price for Bob.  It's a better deal than John's offer of $1,000,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll end up having to pay John's higher price.  Accepting the offer at $900,000 is the most sensible choice."
