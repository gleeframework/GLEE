"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in the product. I'm confident it holds immense value for you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and your potential return on investment."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** By starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and your minimum acceptable price, we establish a strong anchor. This sets the stage for negotiation and potentially leads Bob to consider a price higher than he initially planned.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""immense value"" and ""potential return on investment,"" subtly justifying the high price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial price is high, it leaves ample room for negotiation over the remaining rounds. 
 
It's a delicate balance between appearing too aggressive and potentially scaring Bob away, versus starting too low and limiting your potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,250,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential value.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum of $1,500,000. You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and selling to John is your safety net.  It's time to counter and see if you can bring Bob closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I'm confident it's a price that offers substantial value for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant price reduction from $2,250,000 to $1,900,000. This shows Bob we're willing to negotiate, but also emphasizes our initial point about the product's value. 
* **Staying Above the Minimum:**  We're still significantly above your absolute minimum ($1,500,000) and John's offer, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Confident Tone:**  The language continues to emphasize the value proposition, aiming to bring Bob closer to our target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product and my  maximum budget. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above your guaranteed sale price with John ($1,500,000). While you could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk Bob might lower his offer or walk away in subsequent rounds. Accepting now secures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
