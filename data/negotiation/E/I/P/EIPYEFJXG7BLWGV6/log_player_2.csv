"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$110 is too high for Bob.**  Bob's maximum is $120, and Alice's offer is already close to that. 
* **Negotiation is possible.**  There's room for a counteroffer that could benefit both parties. 
* **Buying from John is always an option.**  This provides a safety net if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint offer:** This counteroffer is halfway between Alice's initial offer ($110) and Bob's maximum ($120).
* **Fair compromise:** It shows Bob is willing to negotiate but also values the product.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:** If Alice rejects, there's still space to go up or down in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  Both parties can move closer to a mutually acceptable price.
* **Buying from John is still an option.** This ensures Bob has a fallback if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is the midpoint between Bob's previous offer ($105) and Alice's current offer ($115).
* **Showcasing willingness to compromise:** This demonstrates Bob's willingness to meet Alice halfway, increasing the likelihood of a deal.
* **Maintaining a safe margin:**  This offer keeps Bob within his budget while still allowing for potential further concessions."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at Bob's maximum.**  There's no room for further negotiation to get a better price.
* **Buying from John is equally expensive.** There's no financial advantage to continuing negotiations. 
* **Time is a factor.** With limited rounds remaining, it's best to secure the product now rather than risk getting nothing."
