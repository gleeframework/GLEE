Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Considering its immense value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us, given its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, and you can potentially settle somewhere around $1,000,000 or slightly higher.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below $800,000. This gives you leverage in negotiations.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how desperate he might be for the product."
