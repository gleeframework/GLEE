Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $140."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a profit above John's offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The message highlights the product's value to Bob, making it more likely he'll be willing to pay a premium compared to a simple price statement. 
 
This strategy balances ambition with a realistic chance of acceptance."
