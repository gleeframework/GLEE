"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Alice's offer.  $90 is too high, and I can get it for $100 from John. Let's see if I can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $90 is a bit steep for me. How about $85?  I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $85 is closer, but I need to be at least $88 to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and go with $88? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Alice's offer. $88 is still more than I'd like to pay, but it's a good deal compared to buying from John and saves me a few bucks."
