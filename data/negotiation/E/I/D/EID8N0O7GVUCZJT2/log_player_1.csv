Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your floor price:** You're guaranteed to make more than selling to John.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** Bob still has a $1,000 incentive to buy from you. 

This approach gives you the best chance of maximizing your profits while still having a reasonable chance of Bob accepting the offer."
