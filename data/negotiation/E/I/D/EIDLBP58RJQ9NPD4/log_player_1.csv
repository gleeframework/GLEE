Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

We're running out of time, and Bob's counteroffers are getting frustratingly close to my minimum price.  While I'm still holding out for a better deal, the risk of losing the sale entirely is too high.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000 to guarantee a sale and avoid any further uncertainty."
