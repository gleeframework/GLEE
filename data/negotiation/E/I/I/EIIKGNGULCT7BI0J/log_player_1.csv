Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This still reflects the significant value of this product, but also demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll need to see a more significant offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant opportunity for you, and I believe we can find a way to close this deal. Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your concession, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, we're running out of time, and $950,000 is still below my minimum threshold.  It's best to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
