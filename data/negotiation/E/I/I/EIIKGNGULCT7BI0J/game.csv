"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This still reflects the significant value of this product, but also demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. Let's find a way to make this work.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a significant opportunity for you, and I believe we can find a way to close this deal. Let's make it happen.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your concession, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
