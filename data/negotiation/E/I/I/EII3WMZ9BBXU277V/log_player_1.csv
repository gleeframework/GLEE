Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product at the special price of $125 just for you. I think you'll find it's a great deal."",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonably:** Offering the product at $125 starts the negotiation above Bob's perceived value but is still low enough to potentially entice him.
* **Creating Perceived Value:**  The phrase ""special price just for you"" aims to make Bob feel like he's getting a unique and valuable opportunity.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $125, there's a chance Bob might counter-offer, giving me an opportunity to settle somewhere above my minimum. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to balance a good profit margin with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer. If I start too high, he might reject the offer outright."
