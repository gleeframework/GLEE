"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is too high.  Since you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John, it's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer.  This is a bold move, but it aims to establish a starting point for negotiation that is closer to your desired price. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects the counteroffer."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what you're aiming for.  You're better off continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a price closer to your desired range.  You still have several rounds left to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still offering a price higher than you're comfortable with.  While it's closer to your target range, you still have time to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer and see if you can reach a price that's more favorable."
