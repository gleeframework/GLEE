"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd love! I'm starting the price at $11,000. It's a steal for its value, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for the product's value.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. That's a good compromise, and I believe it still reflects the product's true value. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think we can meet in the middle.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you. $8,500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there yet. Let's split the difference - $9,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,250. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",8250.0,Bob,6,
