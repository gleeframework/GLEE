"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $10,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $8,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $9,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we split the difference and settle at $8,875? That would allow us both to walk away feeling like we got a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8875}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $9,000? That would be a fair compromise, and it's a great deal for a product of this quality.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is holding firm at $9,000.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a good chance you won't be able to get her lower than your target of $8,000. It's better to be safe and buy from John, securing the product at your desired price."
