"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $10,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $8,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $9,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we split the difference and settle at $8,875? That would allow us both to walk away feeling like we got a good deal.",8875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $9,000? That would be a fair compromise, and it's a great deal for a product of this quality.  What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,7,
