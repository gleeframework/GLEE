"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's beneficial to negotiate and see if you can get a price closer to your budget.  You can always buy from John for $12,000 if the negotiations don't go your way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer can help you understand Alice's flexibility and potentially reach a deal quicker. Even if she rejects this initial offer, it leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is negotiating, the price is still above your ideal budget and what John is offering.  It's worth countering one more time to see if you can get closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  How about we settle at $10,500? That's the highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This counter-offer shows you're serious but willing to negotiate slightly. 
* **Deadline Implied:**  By stating it's ""the highest [you] can go,"" you add a subtle pressure for Alice to accept without being confrontational.
* **Alternative Present:** You still have John's offer as a backup, so you're not desperate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $10,500 is still a bit too low. How about we meet at $11,000?  This is a fair compromise and would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  While not the $10,000 you initially aimed for, $11,000 is a reasonable compromise and saves you $1,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price. Alice seems firm, and you risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **Time Value:** Reaching a deal now avoids further back-and-forth and lets you acquire the product sooner."
