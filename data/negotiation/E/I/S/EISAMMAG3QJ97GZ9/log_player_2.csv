"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is offering it for $9,500. This saves you $500.
* **Alice's offer is still good for you:** Even though you'd ideally want to pay less, Alice's offer is within your budget and you're still getting a decent deal."
