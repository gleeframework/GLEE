{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $10,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to go down to $12,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it fits my budget."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a bit lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He should continue negotiating and try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $14,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about my costs. How about we settle on $15,500? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to give a bit of a discount for the sake of the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $15,500 is still higher than his budget, and there are only a few rounds left.  It's likely that negotiating further won't get him to his desired price, and he risks losing the opportunity to buy from John."
