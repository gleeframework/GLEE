"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

While buying from John for $120 is the worst-case scenario, accepting Alice's offer of $110 is still a better deal for Bob. It allows him to save $10 compared to John's price and still acquire the product within his budget."
