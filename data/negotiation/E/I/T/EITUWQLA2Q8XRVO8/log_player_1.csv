{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000 but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly in my counteroffer, keeping in mind that I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to commit to a maximum of $1,100,000. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is a decent offer, it's still far below my desired value of $1,500,000. I'll counter Bob's offer, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I believe I've found a balance at $1,125,000. This is my final offer. I hope you can meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $1,125,000 is still significantly less than my desired price.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's not likely I'll get much closer to my target of $1,500,000.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired value, so I'll take the guaranteed sale."
