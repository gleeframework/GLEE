,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, that price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from the $1,050,000. I'd like to propose a price of $950,000. This is my best and final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
