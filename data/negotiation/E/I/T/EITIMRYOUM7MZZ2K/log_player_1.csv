Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This price is a good starting point as it's above my minimum acceptable value of $8,000 and leaves room for negotiation. It also allows for a potential profit for both of us, as Bob values the product at $10,000.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable value, it's still below my initial desired price.  I'm willing to negotiate further and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm countering with a price of $9,000. This price is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $10,000, and it's closer to my desired selling price. Hopefully, he'll accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,700 is only slightly lower than my counteroffer, and it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  Since I'm uncertain if I can get a better price from further negotiation, and I don't want to risk selling to John for less, I'll accept Bob's offer."
