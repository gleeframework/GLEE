{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $115 leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and the good deal being offered.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message invites Bob to respond, creating a dialogue rather than a hard stance.

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** The starting price is higher, increasing the chance of a higher final price.
* **Encourage negotiation:**  A friendly tone and open invitation to counteroffer allows for a more dynamic interaction.
* **Protect my interests:** The price is still above my minimum, ensuring I don't lose money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I could accept it and avoid further negotiation, selling to John for $120 is a more profitable option. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum price.
* **Emphasize Value:**  The message reinforces the product's value, justifying the price.
* **Open to Finality:**  The phrase ""Let me know what you think"" implies a willingness to potentially reach a final agreement. 

This approach aims to:

* **Secure a higher price:**  $110 is closer to my desired price than Bob's offer.
* **Maintain control:**  I'm still the one setting the price, keeping the negotiation in my favor.
* **Encourage acceptance:**  The message is friendly and conveys a desire for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still thinking that $100 is a fair price for the product. Can you meet me at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $105 is getting closer to my minimum price of $120, it's still not enough.  I've already lowered my price once, and further negotiation could risk losing time and potentially ending with an even lower price.  John's offer of $120 guarantees me a profit and avoids any further negotiation. Therefore, I will choose to sell the product to John for $120."
