"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $110."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers. I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to encourage a good relationship."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $90 is a good offer, I'm looking for something a bit closer to $105.  Would you be willing to go a little higher?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $97.50. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $97.5 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a little more. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I appreciate your persistence.  How about we split the difference and go with $101.25?  This feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 101.25} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $100. How about we meet at $99? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $99
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, I need to be realistic. While $99 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not sure I can get Bob to budge much more. It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John rather than risk another few rounds of negotiation with Bob."
