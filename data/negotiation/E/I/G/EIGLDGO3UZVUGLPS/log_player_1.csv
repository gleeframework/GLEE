"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I will reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to sell the product at my minimum, I believe I can potentially get more. I will proceed to round 3 and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still believe the product is worth more than $120. I'm hoping Bob will see the value and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I will accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a higher price, $125 is still a good deal, and it's better than selling to John for $120. It's also likely that if I reject Bob's offer, he may not offer any higher in the remaining rounds."
