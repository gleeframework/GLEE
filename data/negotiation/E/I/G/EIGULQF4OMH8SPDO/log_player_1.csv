Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $700,000, considering my own valuation and the need to make this a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
