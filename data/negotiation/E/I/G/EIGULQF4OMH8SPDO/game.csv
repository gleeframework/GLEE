"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $700,000, considering my own valuation and the need to make this a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
