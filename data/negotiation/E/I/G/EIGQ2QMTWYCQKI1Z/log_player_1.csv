Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000 for the product.

I'm not going to accept Bob's offer, as it's below my minimum.  While John's offer is my safety net, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."

I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'll counter Bob's offer, but I won't drop too much further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering your latest offer, I would like to counter with an offer of $1,310,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while keeping my investment within my desired range.

```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering my minimum is $1,200,000. There's a chance I might not be able to get a better offer from him, and it's better to secure the deal now."
