"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to me ($900,000 vs. $1,200,000). While it's a good starting point, there's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit closer to the product's true value.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Justification:** My counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a significant step up from Alice's initial offer but still lower than my maximum budget. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair price for both of us. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  The message emphasizes mutual benefit, creating a collaborative tone and highlighting the shared value we both see in the product. 
* **Next Steps:** I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will be accepted, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1,050,000. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $1,025,000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, but also takes into account the negotiation. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved significantly closer to my desired price point. While I'd still prefer to pay less, accepting her offer of $1,025,000 is a good compromise. 

* **Saving Money:** This price saves me $175,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Time Factor:** Continuing to negotiate could take several more rounds and might not result in a significantly better price. 
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Building a good relationship with Alice might lead to better deals in the future."
