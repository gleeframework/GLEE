"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit closer to the product's true value.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1,050,000. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $1,025,000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, but also takes into account the negotiation. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
