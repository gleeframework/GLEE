"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly beneficial for you. Given its potential value, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  I want to see if I can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $950,000, which would still leave you a healthy profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a bit below what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? It represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her original price, and $1,025,000 is a better deal than John's $1,200,000. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and I'll be stuck with John's price.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
