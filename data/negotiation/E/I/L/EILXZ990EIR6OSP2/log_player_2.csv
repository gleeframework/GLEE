"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product that I believe will be highly beneficial to your business.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true market value and represents a compelling investment. Consider this a chance to secure a valuable asset at a price that will generate substantial returns. I'm confident that this product will be a game-changer for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is less than John's price of $1,200,000.
* **You can still make a profit:** Even at $1,000,000, the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, meaning you'd be buying it for a price higher than its value to her, but still lower than its value to you.  

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option as it allows you to save $200,000 compared to buying from John."
