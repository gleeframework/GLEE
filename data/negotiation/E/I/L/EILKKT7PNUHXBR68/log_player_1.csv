"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay. Considering my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm offering $600000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value I see in this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm prepared to offer $750000. This would be a significant saving for you, and would let us both walk away feeling good about the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  While Bob's offer of $750,000 is tempting, I don't have time to continue negotiating and risk getting a lower price.  John's offer is a safe and secure way to ensure I get a fair price."
