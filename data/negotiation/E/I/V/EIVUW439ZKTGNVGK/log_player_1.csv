"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $18,000, knowing that I have a safety net with John's offer. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my ideal price.  I'm also framing it as a ""great deal"" to hopefully pique Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away. I believe there's still room to negotiate, especially since I have 8 more rounds to go. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price. I'm willing to come down to $15,000.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer at $15,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I have several rounds left, so there's time to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  I'm willing to drop to $14,000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $14,000.  This is another step closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm emphasizing the discount to show I'm willing to compromise and hopefully encourage Bob to do the same."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We've been going back and forth for a few rounds, and while I'd prefer a higher price, I'm getting closer to my minimum.  It's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether. $13,000 is a good deal, and I'm happy to close the deal now."
