"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I am extending this opportunity to purchase it at a special introductory price of $140. This is an exclusive offer tailored for discerning individuals like yourself who appreciate quality and value. I look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $150 for the product. Alice's offer is $140, which is still above your ideal price point. Since you can get the product from John for $150, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option to save money."
