"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the value I see in the product.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 is still significantly below my valuation for this product. I could consider letting it go for $2,100,000. This offer reflects the true value and potential I see in it.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $2,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000. I think this price is a fair compromise that reflects the value I see in the product.",1950000.0,Bob,4,
