"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly less than what I'd consider.  I could be flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? I believe this price point reflects the true value of the product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you're trying to get a good price for your product, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while still staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
