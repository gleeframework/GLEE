"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I offer it to other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's still significantly more than your $800,000 maximum and what John offers. You can save a considerable amount of money by rejecting this offer and going with John."
