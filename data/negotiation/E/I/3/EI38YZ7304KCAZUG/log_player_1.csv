Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I offer it to other potential buyers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, I want to see if Bob will pay a higher price, maximizing my profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob quickly might be preferable, even at a slightly lower price, rather than waiting for John's guaranteed purchase.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The message subtly implies that Bob needs to act fast to secure the deal before others get a chance.

This approach allows me to test Bob's willingness to pay a premium while still having the security of John's offer as a backup."
