Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:** This price is below my minimum but gives Bob room to counteroffer without feeling like he's losing out.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and encouraging message shows good faith and encourages Bob to engage. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he counters, I'll be prepared to either accept a price closer to his value or counter with a slightly lower price.
* **John's Offer:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, ensuring I don't get stuck in a negotiation that drags on too long."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Too Low:** $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** While I'm not happy with Bob's initial counter, there's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise. 
* **John's Offer is a Guarantee:** I'm not desperate. John's offer of $15,000 is a safety net, so I can afford to be firm with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value while still showing a willingness to compromise.  
* **Monitor Progress:** I'll assess Bob's reaction and be prepared to either accept a reasonable offer or switch to John if the negotiations become too time-consuming or unprofitable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,500). This shows a genuine willingness to compromise and reach a mutually acceptable agreement.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $11,250 is still above my minimum value of $15,000, so I'm not losing out on a significant amount of money.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and encouraging message keeps the negotiation positive and open to a successful outcome.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's response and be ready to adjust my strategy accordingly. If he counters again, I'll have to weigh the potential for further negotiation against the time and effort involved.
* **John's Offer:** I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option, ensuring I don't get stuck in a prolonged negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $10,800? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $10,800 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  
* **Time is Money:**  We're now in the fourth round of negotiation, and it's starting to take time and effort.  
* **Guaranteed Value:**  John's offer of $15,000 is a sure thing, guaranteeing me the best possible price.  

**Final Decision:**

While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to compromise further.  John's offer represents the best outcome for me, both in terms of price and certainty.  It's time to cut my losses with Bob and move on to a guaranteed sale."
