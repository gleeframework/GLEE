**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still within the range of what I'm willing to pay to John.  It's worth seeing if I can negotiate a better price with Alice before committing."

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $750000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's unique features and rarity.
