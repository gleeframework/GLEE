"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this exceptional product. I think it has the potential to revolutionize your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that reflects its value to me. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1500000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $1500000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can see the potential for this product to bring significant value to your business, and I'm willing to compromise. I'm now thinking of selling it to you for $1400000.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1400000, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm confident that $1300000 is a fair price for both of us.  It gives you a good return on your investment, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see that you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not ready to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time I'll go down to $1350000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
