"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this exceptional product. I think it has the potential to revolutionize your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that reflects its value to me. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's opening offer is exactly your maximum budget.  There's no reason to accept at this point. We should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can see the potential for this product to bring significant value to your business, and I'm willing to compromise. I'm now thinking of selling it to you for $1400000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's counteroffer is lower, it's still too high.  We should continue to negotiate and try to push the price down further.  We still have time and can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,400,000, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm confident that $1,300,000 is a fair price for both of us.  It gives you a good return on your investment, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see that you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not ready to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time I'll go down to $1350000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. At $1,350,000, we're getting a good deal, and it's within our budget.  While we could try to negotiate further, we've already gone through several rounds, and the risk of Alice walking away or us not being able to agree on a price is increasing.  It's best to accept this offer and secure the product."
