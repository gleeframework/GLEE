"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is within your budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the better strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's still within my budget but closer to the product's value to Alice. This should encourage her to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but $110 is still a bit high. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal.  I'm confident I can get the price lower with more negotiation rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still feeling a bit high at $110. Let's meet in the middle at $107.50. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a good deal.  This should encourage Alice to accept or make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
