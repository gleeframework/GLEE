"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,350,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $1,000,000 is below what I had in mind, I understand you see the value in this product.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000, which is a significant step up from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, considering we've both moved a bit from our starting points. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
