Alice's initial offer is too high.  While it's lower than her perceived value, it's still above your maximum budget. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above my budget.  I can get the product from John for a lower price, so it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice."
