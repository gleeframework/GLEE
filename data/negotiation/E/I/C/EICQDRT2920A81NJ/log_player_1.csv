Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $140 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message aims to convey the product's value and encourage Bob to accept the offer without feeling pressured."
