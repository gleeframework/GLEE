"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think!",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's try to meet in the middle.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $95 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal!",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is still above my budget. How about we settle on $98? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",98.0,Bob,6,
