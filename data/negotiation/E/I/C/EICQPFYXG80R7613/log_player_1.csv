Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me some room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and counteroffer.  I need to get closer to my minimum price of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's a more reasonable starting point for negotiations.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good deal and be willing to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject it and counteroffer again. I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $12,000 at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm going to drop my price to $11,000.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal.  If he rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob has shown himself to be a tough negotiator.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
