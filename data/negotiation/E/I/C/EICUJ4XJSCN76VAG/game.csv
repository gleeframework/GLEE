"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing and finding a mutually beneficial deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $750,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's value.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. This is a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
