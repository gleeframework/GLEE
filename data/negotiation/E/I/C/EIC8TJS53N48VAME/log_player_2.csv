"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is far too high.  It's above your maximum budget, and you'd be losing a significant amount of money. It's better to try to negotiate or move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with my maximum price, which is the same as what John is offering. This is a bold move, but it establishes my firm budget and forces Alice to consider a significant discount if she wants to make a deal with me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my budget.  There's room for further negotiation, and I want to try to get a better deal before potentially going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round.  I'm showing Alice I'm willing to compromise but still want a significant discount.  I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my maximum budget, but still gives Alice some profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, but $14,000 is still above my maximum budget. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get her down even further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm going up slightly from my last offer to show Alice I'm serious about a deal, but still pushing for a price closer to my maximum budget.  I'm hoping she'll accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to walk away if she doesn't."
