"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $18,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still securing a profit above my minimum acceptable value of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to take a significant loss.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $16,000. This is still a fair profit for me, while also showing Bob that I'm serious about making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  While selling to John for $15,000 is a safe option, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial goal of $18,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $14,000.  This is a compromise that shows I'm flexible, but still ensures I'm making a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum. Accepting this offer guarantees me a sale and a profit.  Also, with only 4 rounds left, the risk of not finding a better deal with Bob increases, and I don't want to miss out on this opportunity."
