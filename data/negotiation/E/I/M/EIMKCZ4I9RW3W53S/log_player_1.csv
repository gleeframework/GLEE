Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice won't sell for less than $1,000,000 because she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **The Sweet Spot:**  Alice wants to maximize her profit. She needs to offer a price attractive enough for Bob to accept but high enough to give her a significant gain.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. I believe this price reflects its worth while also recognizing the significant benefit you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Why This Strategy?**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,150,000 is significantly above Alice's minimum, allowing her to maximize her profit. 
* **Appealing to Bob:** The price leaves Bob with a potential surplus of $50,000 ($1,200,000 - $1,150,000), making it a good deal for him.
* **Justified Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value proposition,"" subtly justifying the high price.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept. He might try to negotiate a lower price. Alice will need to decide if she's willing to lower her price slightly or stick to her original offer."
