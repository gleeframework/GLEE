This offer starts the negotiation by presenting a price slightly higher than the minimum you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation while still maximizing your potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I want to reach an agreement, I won't accept such a drastic undervaluation. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $950000? It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While I appreciate Bob's attempt to find a compromise, $950,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price.  I will counter with a price that is closer to my target."

Bob's offer:

While $1,020,000 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to accept the offer and avoid the risk of further negotiations potentially dropping the price even lower."
