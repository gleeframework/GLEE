"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the competitive price, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to do $8500?  I'm very interested in your product, and I think this price is fair considering what it's worth to me."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8500. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down slightly, she's still above Bob's ideal price.  There's still room for negotiation, and it's worthwhile to continue trying to get a lower price.  Bob can afford to reject this offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $9,500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $9000. I'm willing to compromise again. I'll meet you at $9200. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Ideal Price:**  Alice's offer of $9,200 is very close to Bob's desired price point (he's willing to pay up to $12,000). 
* **Negotiation Exhausted:**  Bob has already made several counteroffers and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise.  Further negotiation might not result in a significantly lower price.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If Bob rejects this offer, Alice might become less willing to negotiate further, and Bob could end up paying the full $12,000 to John. 

Accepting the offer secures a good deal for Bob, and it's unlikely he'll find a better price through further negotiation."
