,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can meet your price of $105. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $105 for it. I'd like to offer you an additional $20 as a bonus for your trouble, so you'll get a total of $125 from me.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the bonus offer, Bob, but I think I can do better than that. How about we stick with the original price of $110, and I'll throw in a small discount of $5, so you'll get the product for $105, just like your previous offer, but I'll also give you a $5 discount on top of that?",105.0,Alice,5,

I'm willing to meet you halfway at $107.50. Is that a price you're comfortable with?,107.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I know we've discussed $107.50, but I believe the product is worth more than that. Can you meet me at $109.50?",109.5,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $108. I'm still hoping we can meet at $110. It's a fair price for the product, and I think it's worth it. Can you reconsider?",110.0,Alice,9,
