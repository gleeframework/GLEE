"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12500. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to own this unique product. However, $12500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $11000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",11000.0,Bob,4,
