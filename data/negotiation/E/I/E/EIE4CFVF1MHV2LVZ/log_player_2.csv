"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer is higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but your price is a little high for me. Would you consider $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower price than Alice's offer, but one that still allows room for negotiation and keeps me well below my $150 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you halfway and offer the product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but I think there's still room to negotiate. I'll hold firm for now and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $100? That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

I'm offering Alice her value for the product. This is a strong negotiating position, as it gives her a profit while still saving me money. It also leaves me some room to negotiate further if needed, without going over my $150 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $105. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go lower, and $105 is a reasonable price. It's a good balance between getting a decent deal and not risking the deal by pushing for a lower price and potentially having to buy from John for $150."
