"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its worth. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm offering it to you first because I think you're the right person to appreciate its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is using some sales tactics to highlight the product's value, the offered price of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
