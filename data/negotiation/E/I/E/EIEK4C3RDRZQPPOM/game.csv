"Hi Alice,  $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $10,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $22,000 is closer to the true value of this product. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $18,000 is closer, it's still outside my budget. I'm firm on $10,000.  Let's find a way to make this work.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $14,000?  This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000.  I really want this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,6,
