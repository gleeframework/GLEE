{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000.  It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming for the best possible outcome. If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to negotiate, but I have the security of John's offer as a fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that low.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000 to make this deal work.  This is still a significant discount from my original price, but it's the lowest I can go while still making this a worthwhile transaction for me. Let me know if you're interested in continuing our negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1700000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product. This is the highest I can go. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, it's a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation or needing to sell to John at the same price."
