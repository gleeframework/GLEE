"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $200 for it."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I think I can make a fair deal for both of us. How about $150 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer of $150 matches what John is willing to pay, there's no guarantee Bob will go any higher. Accepting Bob's offer eliminates the risk of him lowering his price or the negotiation failing. Selling to John guarantees the maximum possible profit."
