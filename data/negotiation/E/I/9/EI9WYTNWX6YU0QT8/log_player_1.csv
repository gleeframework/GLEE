"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll see if Bob is interested in this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to settle for that right away. I still have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get him to come up a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it's appealing enough to get Bob closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to drive the price down. While $110 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell at that price.  I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can get a better price, so I'll reject his offer and try to get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is a significant increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still below my initial offer and it's only $5 more than my minimum acceptable price. I hope this will be a good compromise and encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet me halfway. He's consistently offering lower prices, and I'm starting to run out of rounds.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Selling to John at $120 ensures I get my minimum acceptable price."
