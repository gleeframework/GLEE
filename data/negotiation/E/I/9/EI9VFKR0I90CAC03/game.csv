,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering me. However, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in this product, but I'd need to see a lower price to make it work for me. How about $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $135 is still a bit high for me.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm really hoping to get it for $125.  This is a fair price considering the offer I made, and it gets us much closer to making a deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $130. I'm willing to make one more compromise, though. I'll meet you at $129, and that's as low as I can go. It's a great price for this product, and I think you'll be happy with the value you get.",129.0,Alice,5,
