"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the potential value the product offers to Bob. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** By leaving room for negotiation, I'm hoping to start a back-and-forth process that could ultimately lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate it. However, $1100000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  I'm prepared to offer you $1050000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for further negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the pressure on him and allows me to control the negotiation process.

**Next Round:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for,  I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, and it would allow us to move forward quickly."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.

* **Urgency:**  I'm suggesting a quick resolution, creating a sense of momentum."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for a fair price, and I'm willing to compromise.  However, $1075000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $1062500. This would be a good middle ground, and it would allow us to finalize the deal quickly.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still a little lower than I'd like.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 6 rounds left, I need to be careful about accepting a deal that's too low. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I want to see if I can push Bob a bit higher before considering a deal. 

**Next Round:**

I will counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, trying to get closer to my desired price point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point about splitting the difference, but $1,062,500 is still below what I need to accept. To move forward, I'm willing to go down to $1,068,750.
