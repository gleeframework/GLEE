{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate it. However, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  I'm prepared to offer you $1,050,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1050000 is closer to what I'm hoping for,  I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1075000? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, and it would allow us to move forward quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, but it's still above your target.  There's room for more negotiation.  You can try to push for a lower price, but if the negotiation stalls, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire for a fair price, and I'm willing to compromise.  However, $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $1,062,500. This would be a good middle ground, and it would allow us to finalize the deal quickly.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1062500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point about splitting the difference, but $1062500 is still below what I need to accept. To move forward, I'm willing to go down to $1068750. This is a significant concession, and I'm confident it's a price that will allow us both to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal, shall we? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,068,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,068,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, and her offer is only $68,750 above your target price. It's a good deal considering you can always purchase from John for $1,000,000 if you need to.  It's likely further negotiation will only result in small price drops, and you could end up spending more time trying to save a few thousand dollars."
