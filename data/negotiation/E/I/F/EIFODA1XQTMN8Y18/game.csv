"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $60 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair price.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that.  $75 is closer, but I'm still at a point where I need to get at least $80 for the product.  I'm confident you'll find it's well worth the price.  What do you think?",80.0,Alice,5,
