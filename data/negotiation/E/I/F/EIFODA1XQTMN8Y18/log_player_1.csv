"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate and ensures I don't immediately reject Bob as a buyer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging message to hopefully build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not pushing for the full $120 right away, as that's likely to be rejected. 

**Strategy:** I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $60 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $120 and even lower than Bob's perceived value of $80.  Accepting this would be a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it demonstrates his interest. This gives me an opportunity to counter and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as a Backup:**  Selling to John for $120 remains a viable option if negotiations with Bob fail.  However, I'm willing to explore further negotiation rounds with Bob to see if we can find a better deal.

**Next Steps:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming for a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $60 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer of $85 is a compromise.  It's significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my desired price.  This shows a willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Positive Language:**  The message is again friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, encouraging Bob to accept. 
* **Leaving Room for Further Negotiation:** While $85 is my target, I'm not ruling out further negotiation if needed.

**Strategy:**  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob. If not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating, but I'll be more firm in my pricing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While $75 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting would mean a loss for me.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  Bob's willingness to meet in the middle shows he's motivated.  This is another chance to counter and try to reach a more favorable price.
* **John Remains a Safe Option:**  Selling to John for $120 is always available if negotiations with Bob fail, but I'm still hopeful we can reach a deal that works for both of us.

**Next Steps:**  I'll counter Bob's offer again, trying to push the price a little higher, but I'll be mindful of his willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that.  $75 is closer, but I'm still at a point where I need to get at least $80 for the product.  I'm confident you'll find it's well worth the price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:**  I'm only asking for $5 more than Bob's offer, showing I'm flexible.  However, $80 is my absolute minimum to avoid a loss.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to reinforce the reason for my price. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  I'm using an open-ended question to invite Bob to continue negotiating, but I'm also making it clear that $80 is my bottom line.

**Strategy:**  I'm hoping that by showing a willingness to compromise and emphasizing the product's value, I can convince Bob to agree to my counteroffer.  If not, I'll need to be more firm in my next counteroffer."
