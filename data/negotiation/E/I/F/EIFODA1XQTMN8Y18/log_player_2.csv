"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny! What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is too high. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($60) to try and gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This leaves room for me to increase my offer in subsequent rounds if necessary, while still aiming for a price well below my $80 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $60 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice came down in price, but $85 is still above my maximum budget and John's offer. I'll try to negotiate a bit further, but I'm prepared to buy from John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm moving closer to my limit but still leaving some room for negotiation.  Suggesting a ""middle ground"" might encourage Alice to agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that.  $75 is closer, but I'm still at a point where I need to get at least $80 for the product.  I'm confident you'll find it's well worth the price.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has met my maximum price. There's no point in negotiating further or going with John, as they both offer the same price now."
