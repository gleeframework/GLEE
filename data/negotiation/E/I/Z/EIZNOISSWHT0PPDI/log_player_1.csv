""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 allows for some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, Alice is still getting a price significantly higher than her minimum ($12,000)."
