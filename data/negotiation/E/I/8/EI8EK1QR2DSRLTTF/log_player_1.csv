Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $135.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Offering $135 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $120, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **John as a backup:**  The knowledge that John is willing to pay $150 provides a safety net.  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can always go to John.
* **Building rapport:**  The message starts with a friendly tone to build a positive relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $135 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $125? I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is a little tight. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $125 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is low, he's expressed interest in the product. There's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually acceptable price.  
* **John's offer as leverage:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $150 gives me a strong bargaining position.  

**Next steps:**  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest!  I understand your budget is tight, but $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I'm really hoping we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by moving halfway between my initial offer of $135 and Bob's offer of $125. 
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a positive and friendly tone, emphasizing my willingness to work with Bob.
* **Appealing to his interest:** I reiterate that I'm ""really hoping we can make this work"" to show my desire to reach a deal.

**Goal:**  This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both parties, while still getting closer to my desired price."
