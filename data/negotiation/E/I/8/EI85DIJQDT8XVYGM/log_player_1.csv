"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, allowing for some potential negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit. I'll see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum, it's still too early to accept. Bob's low offer gives me an opportunity to push for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to go higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum price. It allows for more potential back and forth with Bob without immediately resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $125.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. It's still early in the negotiation and we have plenty of rounds left. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering $130. This is a slight decrease from my last offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a profit margin.  I'm hoping Bob sees this as a fair compromise and is willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is getting too low for me.  I'm starting to run out of rounds and I'm not sure if I can get a better price from him.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120, which is still a decent profit."
