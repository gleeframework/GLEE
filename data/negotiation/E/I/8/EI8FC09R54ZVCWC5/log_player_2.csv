"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,000 is less than Bob's maximum price, there is potential to save more money.  Bob can make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $10,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer. This is a strategic move to test Alice's willingness to negotiate.  While $10,500 is still a good deal for Bob, it's important to push for the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $11,500 is a good deal for Bob.  While he could potentially push for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price below his maximum and saves him $3,500 compared to buying from John."
