Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is higher than your minimum of $10,000, but leaves room for negotiation.  It's also significantly less than the $15,000 the product is worth to Bob, making it a potential win for both of you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below what I consider a fair price. I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to the value I believe the product holds."
