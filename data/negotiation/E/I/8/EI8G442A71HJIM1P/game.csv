"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that aligns with your interests. As we're just starting our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'll counter with a price of $925,000. This is a fair compromise that I believe will benefit both of us. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking to maximize your return, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and the opportunity cost of going with John.  Let's find a middle ground and finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'll counter with a price of $912,500. This is a fair compromise that I believe will benefit both of us. What do you think?",912500.0,Alice,5,
