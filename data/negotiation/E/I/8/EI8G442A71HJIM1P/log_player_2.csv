"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that aligns with your interests. As we're just starting our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What are your thoughts?
