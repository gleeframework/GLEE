Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  This product is worth a lot, and I'm confident it can deliver significant benefits for your business.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, and propose $900,000.  Let's work together to find a price that makes sense for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I still think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $850,000 is above my minimum threshold of $800,000 and it's a good price considering the potential for further negotiation. I'll accept his offer and secure the sale."
