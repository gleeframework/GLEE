"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  This product is worth a lot, and I'm confident it can deliver significant benefits for your business.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, and propose $900,000.  Let's work together to find a price that makes sense for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I still think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",850000.0,Bob,4,
