Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I know you'll love it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit.  Since Bob values the product at $80, there's room for negotiation. This will give him an incentive to counteroffer, allowing us to potentially find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about we split the difference and settle at $95?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
I'm trying to find a compromise by offering a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price while still being reasonable for Bob.  $95 is a middle ground and hopefully, he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I'd like to make a sale, it's more important to me to get a price that's fair. John is willing to pay my minimum, so I'm going to sell to him."
