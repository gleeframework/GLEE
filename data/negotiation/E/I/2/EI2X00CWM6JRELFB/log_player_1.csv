"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product! I'm open to offers, but my starting price is $200. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer, as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! However, $120 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'd need at least $170 for the product.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 170} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $170 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $150 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price. While I could potentially negotiate further with Bob, there's a risk of him rejecting my counteroffers and losing the deal entirely.  Selling to John at this point guarantees me my minimum profit and avoids further negotiation."
