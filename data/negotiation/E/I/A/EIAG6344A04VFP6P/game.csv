,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $7,500.  How about we split the difference and meet at $8,250? This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price, and I think $8,000 is a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $7,500, or at least closer to that price?",7250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  While $7,250 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $7,625?  This is a fair price that allows us both to get what we want.",7625.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still thinking $7,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. Would you be willing to consider that?",7000.0,Bob,6,
