"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is a good price, it's still above his maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1150000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is closer to Bob's budget, he's still aiming to save more.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, potentially leading to a lower price closer to his desired $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me while also allowing us both to benefit from the deal. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1125000. This is the lowest price I can offer considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $1125000. This is the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,125,000 is close to Bob's budget, it's still significantly higher than the $1,000,000 he can get from John.  Considering the limited number of rounds remaining (only 5), it's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product from John and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
