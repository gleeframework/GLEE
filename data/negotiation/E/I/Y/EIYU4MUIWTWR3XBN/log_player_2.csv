"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay up to $15,000 and Alice is offering it for that amount, it makes no sense to negotiate further. You can get the product from John for the same price without the hassle."
