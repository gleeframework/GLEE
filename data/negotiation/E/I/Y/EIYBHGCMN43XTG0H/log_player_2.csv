"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering $110. This means you can potentially save money by negotiating further.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering a price that is halfway between Alice's offer ($110) and my maximum price ($120). 
* This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also trying to secure a decent discount. 
*  There's a good chance Alice will accept this offer as it's still above her value of $100 for the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $108 is only $3 more than my initial counteroffer of $105.  Considering I'm willing to pay up to $120, this is a good deal. Accepting allows me to save $12 compared to buying from John.  While I could continue to negotiate, the potential savings are minimal and the risk of John selling the product to someone else is present."
