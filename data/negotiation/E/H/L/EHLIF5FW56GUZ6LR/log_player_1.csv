"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better price.  I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,250 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal, considering Bob's stated value for the product. I'm going to try and negotiate a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I see we're getting close.  $10,250 is still a bit under my expectations, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about we settle at $10,400?  This is a good middle ground, and it would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,200. I think this is a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $10,200 is getting very close to my desired range.  Given we're already on round 6, I'm concerned about running out of rounds before we reach an agreement. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent price and avoids the risk of having to sell to John for a lower amount."
