"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below the value you've placed on it. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I see we're getting close.  $10,250 is still a bit under my expectations, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about we settle at $10,400?  This is a good middle ground, and it would be a good deal for both of us.",10400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,200. I think this is a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product.",10200.0,Bob,6,
