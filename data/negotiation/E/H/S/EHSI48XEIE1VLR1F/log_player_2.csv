"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $135.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $135 is under your $150 limit, it's still more than Alice values the product for.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get Alice to come down a bit closer to her value.  The worst case is you buy from John for $150."
