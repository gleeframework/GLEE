"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $18,000. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We can definitely negotiate a better price, especially since we have the option to buy from John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,000?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price to give ourselves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Interested:** We maintain a positive and polite tone, expressing interest in the product while also making it clear that we're seeking a more favorable price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Our counteroffer is closer to our ideal price ($15,000) than Alice's initial offer, aiming to shift the negotiation closer to our desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to make this deal work.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress Made:** Alice came down from $18,000 to $16,000, signaling a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Room for Improvement:** $16,000 is still above our target price and our fallback option (John at $15,000). 
* **Continued Negotiation:** We have rounds to spare, so it's worth trying to negotiate a better deal before settling or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet halfway at $14,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** We're proposing a price that's exactly halfway between our previous offer ($12,000) and her current offer ($16,000). 
* **Framing as Compromise:** By presenting it as a ""middle ground,"" we emphasize fairness and a desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Nearing the Limit:** While we're aiming for the best deal possible, we're conscious that $15,000 is our absolute limit (John's offer).  We'll see how Alice responds and adjust our approach in the next round if necessary."
