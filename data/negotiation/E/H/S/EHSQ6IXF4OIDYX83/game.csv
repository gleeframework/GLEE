"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14,000 for the product. How about we try $14,500?",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident I can find a similar product for my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000? ",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to be frugal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $13,500 for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we try $11,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $12,750. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",12750.0,Alice,7,
