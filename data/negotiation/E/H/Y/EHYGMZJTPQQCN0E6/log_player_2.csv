Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,125,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.

Alice has come down to John's price. There's no point in further negotiation as it's unlikely she'll go any lower.  Buying from John avoids any further risk or time spent negotiating."
