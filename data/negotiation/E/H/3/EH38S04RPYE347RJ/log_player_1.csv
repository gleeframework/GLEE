Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good price for me. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need at least $15,000, but I'm willing to negotiate to get closer to that.
* **Bob's value:**  He values it at $10,000, so I need to offer a price he'd find appealing, but still profitable for me.
* **John as backup:** Knowing I have John as a backup buyer for $15,000 gives me leverage to try and get closer to my desired price.

By offering $13,000, I'm offering a significant discount to Bob, making it more likely he'll accept. It's still a profitable sale for me, and if he rejects, I can always fall back on John."
