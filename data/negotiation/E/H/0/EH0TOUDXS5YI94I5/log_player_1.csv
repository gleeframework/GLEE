Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers incredible value, but I'm happy to consider a reasonable counter-offer if you have one."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. Offering it just below this price point aims to maximize profit.
* **Create Urgency:** By mentioning a ""reasonable counter-offer,"" Alice subtly implies that she has other options and Bob shouldn't wait too long. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high, Alice leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate, potentially securing a deal slightly above John's offer.

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, since Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000, it's strategically sound to aim higher initially."
