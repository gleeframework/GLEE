"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $1600000. This is a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised by offering you $1600000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product. I can offer it to you for $1550000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice. However, $1550000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. This is my final offer. Can you consider it?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid I've reached my limit, Bob. I've already made three concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1550000. I'm going to have to decline your offer of $1250000. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me in the middle, but I need you to be serious about the price. I'll offer you the product for $1450000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,7,
