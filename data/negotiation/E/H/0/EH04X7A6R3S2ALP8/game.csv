"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
