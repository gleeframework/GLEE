Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and encouraging message increases the chances of Bob engaging in the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By starting at $12,000, I leave space for Bob to counter with a lower offer, allowing me to negotiate a price that is closer to my goal while still being profitable.

**Note:**  This is just my initial offer. I'm prepared to adjust my price based on Bob's response and willingness to negotiate.  If he rejects my offer, I will carefully consider his counteroffer and whether it is worth my time to continue negotiating with him.  If I feel his counteroffer is too low, I will either counter with a higher price or choose to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, he has expressed interest in the product and is willing to negotiate. This gives me an opportunity to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I will now make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price that is closer to my desired price point. I will continue to negotiate with him until I reach a mutually acceptable agreement or decide that it's not worth continuing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:**  I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still within a range that Bob might consider.  
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's perspective while emphasizing that I'm still willing to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  The offer of $11,000 provides an opportunity for Bob to counter again, giving us a chance to reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response to my counteroffer. Depending on his answer, I'll either continue negotiating or switch gears and sell the product to John for $15,000."
