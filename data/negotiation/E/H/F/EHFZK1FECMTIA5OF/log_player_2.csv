"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $110. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good deal compared to Alice's valuation, Bob can still get a better price. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering the value of the product and your interest, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $107 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $107 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's target price. At this point, Bob has demonstrated his willingness to negotiate, but Alice hasn't shown significant flexibility.  Buying from John for $100 guarantees the best price and avoids further negotiation."
