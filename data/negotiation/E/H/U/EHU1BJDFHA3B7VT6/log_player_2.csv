"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above my budget of $10,000.  It's not even close to a fair price considering my worth of $10,000. It makes sense to reject this offer and see if we can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $14,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to offer you $10,500 for the product, which is still a fair price given its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's reasonably close to my maximum budget, but still leaves room for negotiation. I've also provided a rationale for my offer, focusing on the value of the product to me. This should help keep the negotiation amicable and open the door for a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer with a price of $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is better than her initial one, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can get closer to my desired price. There's still room for compromise, and I don't want to rush into a decision that could leave me overpaying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to offer $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my value of $10,000 and the fact that we're both aiming for a win-win situation. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to negotiate by increasing my offer, but still staying below my maximum budget. By focusing on a ""win-win"" scenario and highlighting the fairness of the offer, I'm hoping to incentivize Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal. However, I'm still a bit far from the value I have in mind. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll counteroffer with a price of $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and it's still a good deal for you as well. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  While I could continue to counteroffer, it's likely that Alice won't budge much further. Buying from John for $10,000 is the best option to ensure I get the product within my budget and avoid further negotiations."
