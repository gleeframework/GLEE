"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $9,000.  Would you consider $8,800 as a compromise? This is a fair price considering the product's value.",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $8,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $8,600. Would you be willing to compromise at this price?",8600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I understand we're getting closer, but $8,600 is still below my minimum.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  Would you consider $8,700?  It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while staying within your budget.",8700.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your persistence, but $8,700 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $8,650. Would you be willing to compromise at this price?",8650.0,Bob,6,
