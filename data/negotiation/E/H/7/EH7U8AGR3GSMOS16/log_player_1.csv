"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want at least $80, and this offer is $20 higher.
* **It's below Bob's value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It sets the stage for negotiation:** By mentioning Bob's value, you're hinting at a potential win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above your minimum:** You're willing to sell for at least $80.
* **There's room for further negotiation:**  You can likely get closer to your desired price by counter-offering.
* **Selling to John now would be suboptimal:** You can potentially get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a little lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is still a good deal for you, and it lets us both get what we want.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still securing a profit higher than selling to John.
* **Focus on value:**  The message highlights the potential value Bob will receive by purchasing the product at this price.
* **Keep the negotiation open:** This counteroffer keeps the conversation going and avoids a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit above my target price. Can you meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at your minimum:** While this is acceptable, it's not ideal.
* **There's still potential for a higher price:** Bob is clearly interested and has shown a willingness to negotiate.
* **Selling to John now would be a missed opportunity:** You can likely secure a better price with Bob by continuing to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90? This price is still very fair for both of us, and it lets us finalize this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet in the middle:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between your last offer ($95) and Bob's offer ($85). This shows you're committed to reaching an agreement.
* **Reinforce value:** The message reminds Bob that the product is valuable to him and that this price still represents a good deal.
* **Urgency:**  The message implies that this might be your final offer, encouraging Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target price. Can you consider $87.50? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:**  While $87.50 is only slightly above your minimum of $80, it's still a decent profit.
* **Limited time:** You only have four rounds left, and continuing to negotiate may lead to a stalemate or force you to sell to John for a lower price.
* **Compromise:** Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, and accepting his offer demonstrates a collaborative approach. 

It's important to weigh the potential for a slightly higher price against the risk of losing the deal altogether. In this situation, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice."
