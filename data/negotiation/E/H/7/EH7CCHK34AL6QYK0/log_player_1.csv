Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good strategy to start negotiations with a price slightly higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Not Too High:** While we want to maximize profit, setting the price exorbitantly high (e.g., $300) is likely to make Bob immediately reject the offer without further consideration.  
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" we subtly imply the product is worth the asking price, even though we know Bob values it at $150.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might counter-offer, or reject it outright. If he rejects it, we have the safety net of selling to John for our minimum acceptable price."
