"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
