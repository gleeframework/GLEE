"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,900000.0
"I understand you're on a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $900,000? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we settle at $750,000? I'm serious about buying this product, but that's the most I can justify spending.",750000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,850000.0
"I appreciate your seriousness about buying the product, Bob, but $750,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $850,000? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product. Let's see if we can make a deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,,
