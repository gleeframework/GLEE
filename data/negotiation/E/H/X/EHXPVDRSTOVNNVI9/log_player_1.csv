Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,200,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to capture as much of the value difference as possible. However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,400,000 leaves a good portion of the value difference for you while still offering Bob a substantial discount compared to his valuation.
* **Justification:** The message doesn't explicitly justify the price, allowing Bob to respond and potentially start a negotiation. If needed, you can later highlight the product's unique benefits and your confidence in its value.

**Important Considerations**

* **Relationship:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower price for goodwill.
* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start even higher.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your bottom line is $1,200,000."
