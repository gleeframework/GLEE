"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110.  It's a great deal for you, and I think we can make this work.  What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $75? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $75 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway,  how about $85? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for working with me. I'm trying to stay within a tight budget.  Would you be willing to do it for $80? If so, we have a deal.",80.0,Bob,6,
