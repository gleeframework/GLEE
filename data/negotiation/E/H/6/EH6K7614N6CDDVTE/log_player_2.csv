Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $75 just isn't working for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway,  how about $85? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a point where it makes sense to take the deal over John's offer.  Let's see if we can push her a little closer to our ideal price."
