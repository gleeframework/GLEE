"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and the significant interest I've received, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is less than her product's value to her, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and going with John saves you money."
