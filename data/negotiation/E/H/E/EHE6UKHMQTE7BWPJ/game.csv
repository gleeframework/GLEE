"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, the market value of this product is substantial, and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $950,000. This is a fair and competitive offer, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm very interested in this product, but my budget only allows for $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. Considering the market value and your interest in the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair offer considering the value of the product to me and the fact that I'm already at the edge of my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
