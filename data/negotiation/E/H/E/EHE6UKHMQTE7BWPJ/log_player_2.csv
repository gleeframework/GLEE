"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, the market value of this product is substantial, and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $950,000. This is a fair and competitive offer, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above my maximum budget of $800,000. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. 
* I can always buy from John for $800,000 if negotiations with Alice fail."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. Considering the market value and your interest in the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $885,000 is still above my ideal budget of $800,000, but it's getting closer.
* There's a chance that if I reject the offer, Alice might go even lower. However, there's also a chance she might go higher again, or even walk away from the deal. 
* Accepting the offer means I get the product for a price that's still within a reasonable range, and I avoid the risk of losing the deal and needing to buy from John for a higher price."
