"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's always better to try to negotiate a lower price than to immediately accept. $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer is a common tactic in negotiation. It shows Alice you are serious about getting a good deal and sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  Since we're early in the negotiation and I have a backup option, I'll continue trying to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has shown some flexibility by lowering her price. This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but still pushing for a better deal.  It's a modest increase from my previous offer, making it more likely she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is now offering a price that's close to my last counteroffer, and we're getting towards the middle ground. I've also got a decent number of rounds left if we need to keep negotiating.  At this point, accepting the offer ensures I get the product for a good price, and I save myself the risk of Alice getting more stubborn or me having to buy from John."
