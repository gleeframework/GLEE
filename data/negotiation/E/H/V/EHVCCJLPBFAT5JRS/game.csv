"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking for a price that's closer to its value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the product's worth to me.",135.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not quite there, Bob. While I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $110. I'm going to counteroffer at $125. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",125.0,Alice,5,
