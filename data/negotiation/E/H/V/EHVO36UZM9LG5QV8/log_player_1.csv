Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation, and it's still lower than your minimum acceptable price. 

By leaving a bit of room for negotiation, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to accept the offer. If he rejects, I can then gauge his interest and adjust my counteroffer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my ideal, hoping to reach a compromise that is more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $92.50? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's meet in the middle at $90.  That's a good price for both of us and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $90 is still below my ideal price, it's a significant improvement from Bob's initial offer and is close enough to my minimum acceptable price that it's worth accepting. I want to avoid the risk of Bob backing out entirely or the hassle of further negotiations.  $90 also represents a good compromise and a fair price for both of us."
