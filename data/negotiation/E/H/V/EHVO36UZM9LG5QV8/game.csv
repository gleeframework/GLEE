"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $92.50? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",92.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's meet in the middle at $90.  That's a good price for both of us and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,
