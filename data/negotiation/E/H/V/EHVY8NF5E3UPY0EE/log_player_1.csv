Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit too high for me. How about we meet somewhere in the middle, say, $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a decent amount, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price point.  There are still 8 rounds left to negotiate. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you consider $950,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $950,000 is still not enough. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. There are still 6 rounds left, and I don't want to sell for less than what the product is truly worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still significantly lower than the value this product brings to you. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
