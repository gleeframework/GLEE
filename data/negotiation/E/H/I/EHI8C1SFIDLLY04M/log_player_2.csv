# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident it will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $18,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer $12,000. This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is tempting, you can still try to negotiate further. You've shown willingness to compromise, and Alice has demonstrated flexibility.  There's still room to close the gap and potentially reach a price you're more comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm willing to go a bit higher.  How about $12,500?  This is a reasonable compromise that allows both of us to be happy with the deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my desired price. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still higher than your ideal price point. With only 3 rounds left, the chances of negotiating further are slim. You've already shown flexibility and made significant concessions, and Alice's final offer indicates she might be less open to compromise. It's  in your best interest to go with the sure thing and buy from John for $10,000 to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially paying more."
