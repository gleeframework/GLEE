Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth $800,000 to you, and I'm confident it will generate significant value for your business.  How about we split the difference and settle on $825,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
