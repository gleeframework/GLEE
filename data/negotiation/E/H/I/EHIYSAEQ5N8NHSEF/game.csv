"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $175, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $175 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  Let's split the difference. How about $125? I'm confident you'll find this a good deal.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product but $125 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $95? That would be a fair compromise I think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $95 is still too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $110. It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
