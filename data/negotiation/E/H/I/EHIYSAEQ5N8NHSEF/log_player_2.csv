You have three options:

Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $95 is still too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $110. It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $110.  While getting the product for a bit less than $110 would be ideal, it's not worth the risk of Alice digging in her heels.  Buying from John for $100 ensures you get the product at the best possible price for you."
