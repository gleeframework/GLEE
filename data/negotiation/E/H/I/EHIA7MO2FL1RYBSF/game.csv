"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $180 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $150, which is my absolute top price for this product. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $165. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit.  $165 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $160?  It's a fair compromise and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",160.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $170. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway again, but $170 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $165.  I think it's a fair price that we can both agree on.",165.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting stuck in a loop here. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that it's worth it. I'll sell the product to you for $172.50. That's as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",172.5,Alice,7,
