Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it will bring you significant returns."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and still ensures you make a significant profit.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""value and potential"" aims to frame the price as justified rather than arbitrary. 
* **Confidence:** By expressing your belief in the product's potential for Bob, you aim to increase his perceived value.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
