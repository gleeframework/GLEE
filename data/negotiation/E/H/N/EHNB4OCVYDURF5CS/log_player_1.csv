Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I will try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500 to try and make this work.  This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hesitant to accept.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John because I believe there's still a chance to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $11,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise again and offer you the product for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm willing to negotiate with you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $11500. How about we meet in the middle at $11250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still hesitant to accept Bob's offer of $11,250. It's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I want to see if I can get a bit higher. I'm not ready to sell to John yet as I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $11,375? This is a very fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.  I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out on selling to John."", ""product_price"": 11375}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short of my target. How about we meet at $11000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  While I would prefer to get closer to my target price, I'm confident that selling to John for $15,000 is the best option at this point. It's a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum acceptable price."
