Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $825000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $825,000, which is getting closer to my target price and significantly less than what John is offering.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a chance Alice might not budge further and I might end up paying more with John.  It's a good deal at this point."
