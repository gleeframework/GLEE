"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a lower price of $12,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for making a counter-proposal.  While I understand your budget constraints,  $12,000  is  below  the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and counter at $15,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the product's worth.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand the value of the product, but unfortunately, $15,000 is still slightly above my budget. I would like to propose a counter-offer of $13,500. I hope this proposal is more acceptable.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your persistence.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the product's true value.  Would you consider $14,250? This is a compromise that hopefully works for both of us.",14250.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your offer, but I am still unable to meet at $14,250. I would like to propose a counter-offer of $14,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",14000.0,Bob,6,
