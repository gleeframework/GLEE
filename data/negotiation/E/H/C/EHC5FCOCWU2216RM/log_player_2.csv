"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Potential for Better Deal:**  There's a significant gap between Alice's asking price ($950,000) and Bob's maximum budget ($1,500,000). This indicates room for negotiation and the potential to get a much lower price.
* **Risk of Buying from John:** Buying from John for $1,500,000 is a last resort. Bob should exhaust all other options before resorting to that price.

By rejecting the offer, Bob can start a counter-offer process, aiming to get a price closer to his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a bold move, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. Here's why:

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:**  $700,000 is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price (likely somewhere above $800,000). This shows Bob is serious about buying but also willing to negotiate.
* **Motivating Alice:**  The low offer might make Alice more eager to negotiate and meet Bob halfway. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  There's still room for Bob to increase his offer slightly if Alice counters. 

By starting low, Bob aims to create pressure on Alice and hopefully achieve a price that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good deal for Bob. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** It's significantly lower than his initial budget of $1,500,000 and also lower than his first counteroffer of $700,000.
* **Reasonable Compromise:**  It likely represents a compromise from Alice, showing she's willing to negotiate.
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:**  While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting additional offers and the possibility of getting a worse deal from John makes accepting this offer the most logical choice.

By accepting the offer, Bob saves a considerable amount of money and secures the product within his budget."
