Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for you to make concessions without going below your acceptable price.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows you're confident in your product's value while still being open to negotiation. 

Remember, you can always adjust your offer depending on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am only able to pay up to $8000 for the product. Would that be acceptable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range.  I want to see if there's some middle ground we can reach."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to see if we can find common ground.  This would still be a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
