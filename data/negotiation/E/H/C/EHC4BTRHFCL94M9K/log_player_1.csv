Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 works for both of you. 

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but offering a price too close to $1,200,000 might scare Bob off.  A good strategy is to aim high within the ZOPA, leaving room for negotiation if needed.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Tone:**  You're not desperate; you have another buyer. Projecting confidence can lead to a better outcome.
* **High Anchor:** $1,150,000 sets a high starting point.  
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message invites Bob to share his thoughts, leaving space for counter-offers.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. You could adjust the price slightly up or down depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a deal with Bob."
