"Hi Alice,  $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in your product but I can't afford that price.  I'm willing to pay $1000000. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1750000? This price still allows me to profit while acknowledging your financial limitations.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1750000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1250000. That's a significant increase from my initial offer, and I hope it's a starting point for us to find a mutually agreeable price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1250000 is still below my desired price, I'm open to continuing the discussion. I'm proposing $1600000 as a compromise.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable profit for me.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1600000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1400000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I hope it's a realistic compromise. If we can't come to an agreement at this price, I may need to consider other options.",1400000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your continued negotiations. While $1400000 is closer to my desired price, I'm willing to make a final concession. I'm proposing $1450000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair and reasonable offer that will allow us both to reach an agreement.  Let's close this deal.",1450000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  $1450000 is still above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering $1425000.  This is my final offer.  If we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options.",1425000.0,Bob,8,
