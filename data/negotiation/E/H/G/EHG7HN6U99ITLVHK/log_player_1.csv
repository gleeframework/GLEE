Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no incentive to go lower. Offering it to Bob at your minimum acceptable price aims for the highest possible profit. 
* **Direct Approach:** A clear and direct message avoids unnecessary back-and-forth negotiation. 
* **Slight Implication of Scarcity:**  Mentioning listing it ""publicly"" subtly suggests other potential buyers might be interested, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** While this strategy maximizes potential profit, it's possible Bob might be put off by the initial high price.  There's always a trade-off between aiming high and potentially losing a sale."
