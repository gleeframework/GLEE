"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my valuation of the product, I would like to propose a price of $875,000. This still allows me to save some money while acquiring the product.",875000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000, which is a significant discount from my initial asking price. This offer reflects my desire to work with you, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for the product. Let me know what you think.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. Based on my needs and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $900,000. This still gives me a good savings over my valuation, and I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
