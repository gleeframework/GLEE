"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $90. I think you'll find it valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product from John for $100, which is your maximum price. Alice is offering it for $90, which is a better price, but you can always reject the offer and get it from John."
