"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $90. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $90 is higher than both your maximum price ($80) and John's offer. By rejecting and making a counteroffer, you can try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. The product looks great, but $90 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($65) leaves room for negotiation while still being within a reasonable range. It also signals that you're serious about buying but looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $65 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $75? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving closer to your desired price, but $75 is still above your target.  You can risk one more counteroffer to see if she'll go lower, especially since you have John's offer of $80 as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'd be willing to meet you at $70. That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy if you're okay with it."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer aims to split the difference between Alice's latest offer ($75) and your previous counteroffer ($65).  It shows you're still negotiating but also willing to compromise to reach a deal quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $70! I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to give you a slight discount. How about we try $72? It's still a great price, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $72, which is a good deal and only $8 less than your maximum price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate might make her less willing to deal. Accepting now secures the product at a price you're comfortable with."
