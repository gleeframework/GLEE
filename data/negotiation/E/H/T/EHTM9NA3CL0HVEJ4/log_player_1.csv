{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I know it's a valuable asset, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable value, but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Clear Communication:**  My message is friendly and straightforward, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $900,000 leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **Protecting My Interests:**  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000 if Bob's counteroffers are unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $650,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. It's also below Bob's own perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he is interested.  This means there's room for further negotiation.
* **Protecting My Value:** I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. It's better to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price. 

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions while remaining above my minimum acceptable value."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is tempting, it's unfortunately below my minimum acceptable value.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still reflects the significant value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my previous offer of $900,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value again to justify the price.
* **Fairness:** I'm positioning the offer as fair for both parties. 
* **Staying Above My Minimum:**  $850,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000, but lower than my initial offer, allowing for further negotiation.

**Next Steps:** I'm hoping Bob will find this counteroffer more appealing, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to reassess my position and consider either making another counteroffer or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob's offer shows he's willing to compromise, but there's still room for further negotiation.
* **Protecting My Value:**  It's important for me to stick to my minimum acceptable value, especially since I have a guaranteed alternative buyer in John. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap further, but staying above my minimum acceptable value. If Bob doesn't agree, I'll likely sell to John."
