"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I know it's a valuable asset, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Let's negotiate. Alice's offer is too high."

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.  What do you think?"",

}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, aiming to gauge her willingness to negotiate. If she's really motivated to sell, this might be enticing. If not, we can adjust upwards in subsequent rounds while staying well below our $800,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is tempting, it's unfortunately below my minimum acceptable value.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still reflects the significant value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us. What do you think?

Alice is coming down, but she's still significantly above our backup plan with John. Let's counter again, moving closer to a potential agreement."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

We're now splitting the difference between her last offer and our initial counter. This shows willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for further compromise, if needed, to stay below our $800,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for you to make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

Alice has met our maximum price.  There's no point in negotiating further since we can buy from John at this price anyway.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at the desired price point."
