Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob while ensuring he doesn't reject the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $100. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's price creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. There's a good chance he'll see the $145 price as a bargain compared to missing out entirely.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit from Bob and avoiding the risk of him rejecting the offer."
