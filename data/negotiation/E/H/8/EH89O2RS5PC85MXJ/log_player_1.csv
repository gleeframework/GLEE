"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm going to start high, aiming for a significant profit.  Since Bob values the product at $800,000, I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate down from my initial price.  If not, I have John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $700,000 is a decent amount, I'm not willing to accept it yet. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round. I still have John as a backup if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it's attractive enough for him to consider.  I'm still aiming for a good profit while acknowledging that Bob might not be willing to go all the way to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is better than $700,000, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm also aware that I have John as a backup, who is willing to pay the full $800,000. I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer slightly to $825,000.  This is still a decent profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer, which might make him more likely to accept.  I'm hoping to find a sweet spot that's acceptable to both of us before I have to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $775,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to accept it yet. I have John as a backup, who is willing to pay the full $800,000, and I believe I can still negotiate a slightly better price with Bob. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to accept John's offer of $800,000, so I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'm hoping Bob will finally accept my offer, but if not, I'm ready to move on."
