"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000.  This price is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $8900.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement.  What do you think?",8900.0,Alice,5,
