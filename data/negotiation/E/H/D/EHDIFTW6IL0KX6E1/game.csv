"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",60.0,Bob,2,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. That's the most I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value is unknown to me.",80.0,Bob,4,
