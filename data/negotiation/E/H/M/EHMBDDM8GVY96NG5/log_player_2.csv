"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us. Would you be interested in paying $120 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $120 is within your budget, but it leaves you with a smaller potential saving.
* By rejecting this offer, you aim to see if Alice might offer a lower price. 
* You have a backup option (John) at $150, so you're not at risk of losing the product entirely."
