Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $18,000. This is a price that is above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I believe Bob will see this as a reasonable starting point, given his own valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm countering with $17,000. This is still a good price for Bob, as it's lower than my original offer but higher than his own offer. I believe this will encourage further negotiation and potentially lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,500 is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm confident that further negotiation won't yield much more.  Accepting this offer ensures a good sale and avoids the risk of potentially ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John."
