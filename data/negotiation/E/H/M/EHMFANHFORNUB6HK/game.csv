"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $13,500?  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's close the deal!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. But $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to compromise further - how about $13,150? It's just a small step up, but it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?",13150.0,Alice,7,
