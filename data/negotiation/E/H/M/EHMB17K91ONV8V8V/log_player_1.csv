{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your $8,000 minimum.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate but still leaves you a good profit. 
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** By starting with a slightly lower price than what you think it's worth, you're opening the door to a productive negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is more than John's offer, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get closer to your goal of $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows you're flexible:** You're willing to lower your price from your initial offer. 
* **Offers a reasonable compromise:** $9,000 is halfway between your previous offer and Bob's offer, showing you're open to negotiation. 
* **Highlights the value:** You remind Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,750 is close to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get closer to your goal of $9,000. You can try a final counteroffer to see if you can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,750 is close, I'm still a bit below what I need to make this work.  Would you consider a final offer of $8,900? I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know your final decision."", ""product_price"": 8900} 
``` 

This final counteroffer:

* **Shows you're serious about closing the deal:**  You're willing to make a small concession but still have room for profit.
* **Provides a clear path forward:**  You've made your best offer, giving Bob a clear decision to make.
* **Expresses confidence:** You reiterate that this offer is fair and mutually beneficial, which can help sway Bob."
