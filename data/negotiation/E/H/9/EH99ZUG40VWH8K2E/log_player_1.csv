"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Starting high allows room for negotiation and signals that you understand the product's worth. 
* **Below Bob's valuation:** The offer is still significantly below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000), making it attractive to him.
* **Above your minimum:** This ensures you're aiming for a profitable outcome, exceeding your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.

This strategy aims for a quick and favorable deal while leaving room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is substantial, it's still significantly lower than your initial asking price and leaves a considerable amount of potential profit on the table.  You have room to negotiate further and try to close the gap. Selling to John for $800,000 would be a significant loss compared to what Bob is already willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,100,000 is a good starting point, the value this product brings to the table is undeniable.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility:** By lowering the price, you signal to Bob that you're willing to negotiate. 
* **Target the middle ground:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise between your initial asking price and Bob's offer.
* **Maintain a strong position:**  The $1,200,000 price point still represents a significant profit margin for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which suggests he's definitely interested and willing to negotiate. We're still in a strong position with plenty of rounds left. Accepting $1,150,000 would be leaving potential profit on the table.  We can afford to counter and gauge his reaction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To demonstrate my willingness to make a deal, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $1,180,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1180000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding but firm:** You're making a smaller concession this round ($20,000 vs. $50,000) to signal you're reaching a limit.
* **Encouraging a deal:** The message emphasizes that you're making an effort to close the deal.
* **Still a strong price:** $1,180,000 maintains a healthy profit margin and is a reasonable compromise. 

We're aiming to see if Bob is willing to close the remaining gap quickly, or if he's going to continue with smaller increments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,120,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alarm bells! Bob's counteroffer is actually lower than his previous offer. This suggests one of two things:

* **He's trying to play hardball:** Bob might be testing your resolve to see if you'll cave under pressure.
* **He's reaching his actual limit:**  Bob might be less flexible than we initially thought.

Either way, accepting this offer would be a mistake. We need to hold firm and signal that his tactic isn't working.  We'll counter with a smaller concession in the next round, but we also need to be prepared to walk away if he doesn't budge significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end.  My final offer is $1,160,000. This is a very fair price considering the product's value, and I need a decision from you this round. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options."", 
""product_price"": 1160000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** By stating this is your final offer, you create a sense of urgency and put the ball in Bob's court.
* **Slight concession:** The small drop to $1,160,000 shows you're still open to negotiation, but not willing to go much lower.
* **Deadline and alternative:**  Mentioning other options (John) subtly reminds Bob that you have a backup plan and won't be strung along indefinitely.

This approach aims to elicit Bob's final decision while still giving you the option to walk away with the $800,000 from John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your urgency, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to walk away. Bob has:

* **Returned to his initial low offer:** This shows he's not seriously negotiating and is unlikely to budge.
* **Mirrored your language:** His ""final offer"" and ""explore other options"" tactics are a clear attempt to pressure you.

While $1,100,000 is a tempting amount, accepting now sets a bad precedent for future negotiations. You have a reliable offer from John for $800,000, guaranteeing a significant profit without further hassle or risk.  It's a strong move to demonstrate that you value your time and won't be manipulated."
