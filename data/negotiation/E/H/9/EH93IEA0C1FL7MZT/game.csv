"I understand that $1000000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1200000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1100000, which reflects the value I place on the product. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
