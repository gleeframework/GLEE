"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exclusive product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer and make a counteroffer. The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to Bob, so accepting Alice's offer would be a bad deal.  There's a chance that Alice might be willing to lower the price, and Bob can always fall back on buying from John if negotiations fail."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1000000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

While $1,200,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still over his maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate further, potentially by offering a price closer to $1,000,000. If negotiations break down, Bob can always buy from John."
