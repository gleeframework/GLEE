"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. If he rejects, I'll adjust my price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum value, I believe I can get a better price. There are still 9 rounds left, and I can use this time to see if he's willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,350,000, which is still above my minimum value but shows that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider, but I'm also leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.  I will reject his offer and continue to negotiate.  There are still 6 rounds left and I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,250,000.  This is still above my minimum value, but shows that I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully find a price that's acceptable to Bob.  We are down to 5 rounds left, so I need to strike a balance between getting a good price and making sure the deal closes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly low, and we only have 4 rounds left.  I'm starting to run out of time to get a better price.  While I would like to make more than $1,200,000, I'm not confident I can reach that goal with Bob. It's safer to sell to John and ensure I get at least my minimum value."
