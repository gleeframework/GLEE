"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to create a good rapport with Bob.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, as it's worth $15,000 to him. This encourages him to see the potential for a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe it's a bit high at $12,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I believe there's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price point. I'm not ready to settle for $9,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That way, we both get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm making a counter-offer that's closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my minimum. 
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm emphasizing a ""fair deal"" for both of us. This helps to keep the negotiation friendly.
* **Compromise:**  I'm suggesting a compromise to show that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $10,500. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think we can meet somewhere in between $9,000 and $10,500. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,800 is close enough to my target range that I'm willing to accept it.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing him by continuing to negotiate.  Since I have less than 10 rounds left, I want to secure the sale."
