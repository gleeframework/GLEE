,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraint, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $9,250.

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $9,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal and get you the product you want. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're still in negotiations. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $8,875. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, just like I offered in Round 7. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm starting to think we're not going to be able to come to an agreement. What's your next move?",9000.0,Alice,9,
