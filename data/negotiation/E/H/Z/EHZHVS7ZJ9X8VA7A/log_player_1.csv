"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's perfect for you.  I'm offering it to you for $140.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, hoping to get Bob interested in the negotiation. I also want to make it clear that I value his interest and am willing to discuss the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's closer than his initial stance. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can find a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is still a bit below where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $132.50?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 132.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $132.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum, Bob's offer is getting more and more reasonable.  I'm happy to accept $130, as it's a good deal for both of us.  It's also better than selling to John, who is offering a fixed price."
