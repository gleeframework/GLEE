Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We start by aiming high to maximize potential profit. Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John), any price Bob accepts above that is a win.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a sense of urgency and scarcity (""limited-time offer"").
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, though ideally still above your minimum.
* **Understanding Value:**  Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) is lower than yours. By highlighting the ""potential"" and ""value"" of the product, we aim to bridge that gap. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. If he rejects it, you still have the security of selling to John at your desired price."
