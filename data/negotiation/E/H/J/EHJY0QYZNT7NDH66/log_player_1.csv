Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Starting at $10,000 gives me room to negotiate downward if needed.
* **Value Proposition:**  Mentioning the product is ""unique"" might pique Bob's interest and make him consider a higher price. 
* **Open Ended:**  Asking for Bob's ""thoughts"" leaves the door open for negotiation without immediately putting him off. 
* **Plan B:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $8,000 ensures I won't lose out if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8000?   
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Fair:**  Bob's offer is at the minimum price I'm willing to accept. 
* **No Need for Further Negotiation:**  There's no point in risking a lower offer or prolonging the negotiation, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Time is Money:** Accepting quickly avoids the potential for delays or complications."
