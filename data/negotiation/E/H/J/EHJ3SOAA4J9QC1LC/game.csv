"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. I know you've been looking for something like this, and it's truly one-of-a-kind. To make this smooth, I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This item would be valuable to me, but I have a limit.  How about we start the conversation at $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said, $500,000 is quite a ways off from where we need to be. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it's worth a substantial investment. How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product represents value, but I have budget constraints.  $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  Could you consider $750,000?  I think that's a fair offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation, but I assure you this product is worth every penny. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,000,000? That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
