"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would really love. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a special price.  What do you think about $120? Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is within your budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and her initial offer leaves room for negotiation."
