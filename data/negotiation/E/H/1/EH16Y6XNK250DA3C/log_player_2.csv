"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially since we don't know Alice's true value for the product.  There's a chance we can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price ($10,000) gives us room to negotiate.  $7,000 is a good starting point, as it's a substantial discount and might prompt Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but there's still room for negotiation. We're not desperate and can continue to push for a better price. Rejecting the offer allows us to keep pushing towards our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've seen Alice is willing to negotiate, and our initial counteroffer was too low. Increasing our offer to $8,000 shows we're serious about buying the product but are still seeking a good deal. This puts pressure on Alice to make a final decision and potentially accept our offer."
