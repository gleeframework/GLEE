"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 10000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value, I want to gauge his interest. If he rejects, we can negotiate down from here.  But, if he accepts, that's great!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$7,000 is below my minimum, and I'm not yet ready to sell to John.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering the price from my initial offer, but still aiming for a profit higher than my minimum. I'm showing flexibility while staying within my desired price range.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, and I'm not willing to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  It's better to secure the deal now than to risk losing both Bob and John."
