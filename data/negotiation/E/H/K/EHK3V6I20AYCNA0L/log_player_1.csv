{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the product is worth significantly more to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum of $800,000, but leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges the value to Bob, potentially making him more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is higher than what you're asking, but I would like to propose a lower price of $850,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still below your minimum desired value of $800,000. There's potential to get a better deal with Bob, so rejecting his offer and counter-offering seems like the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. I've considered your offer carefully, but I believe $875,000 would be a fair price for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is very close to your minimum desired value of $800,000, there's still room to negotiate.  It's worth attempting one more counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 is still just a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $890,000.  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and allow us to finalize this deal.  I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price, considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 890000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, Alice. I think $885,000 would be a reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $885,000 is very close to your minimum desired value of $800,000, and you've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  Accepting his offer is the best choice, as it's unlikely you'll be able to secure a significantly higher price through further negotiation."
