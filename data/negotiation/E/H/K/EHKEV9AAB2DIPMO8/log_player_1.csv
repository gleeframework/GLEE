"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, to see if he's willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $10,500, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired $11,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that might sway Bob."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to increase his bid further. I still have time and I'm not desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm further lowering my offer to $10,000.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit margin that's worth my time. If Bob still rejects, I'll seriously consider selling to John at $8,000 in the next round."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,800 is close to John's offer, I'm not ready to settle yet. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a slightly higher price. I'm still hopeful that Bob will increase his bid."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm making one final counteroffer at $9,500. This is a significant concession, but it's still above John's offer. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be forced to sell to John in the next round to avoid losing any more time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm running out of time, and Bob's offer is too low. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, selling to John at $8,000 is the best option available right now.  I've secured a profit and haven't lost any more time negotiating."
