"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is my best offer. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,800. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,800, but I'm still a bit over budget. I'm willing to pay $10,600 for the product.  It's my final offer, as I'm happy to go with John's offer for $10,000 if this doesn't work out for us.",10600.0,Bob,4,
