"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is my best offer. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $12,000. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  Selling to John right now would guarantee my minimum, but I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,800. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,800, but I'm still a bit over budget. I'm willing to pay $10,600 for the product.  It's my final offer, as I'm happy to go with John's offer for $10,000 if this doesn't work out for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my ideal price, his final offer of $10,600 is still below my minimum threshold of $12,000.  I've already made two counteroffers, and he's explicitly stated he'll go with John's offer if we can't reach an agreement.  It's likely that further negotiation won't get me a better price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John. Selling to John now guarantees me my minimum and minimizes the risk of ending up with nothing."
