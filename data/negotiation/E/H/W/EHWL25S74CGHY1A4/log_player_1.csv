Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly above John's offer.  Let's see if we can push Bob a bit further."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. While $1,200,000 is a strong offer, I can't let this go for less than $1,300,000. I'm confident that at this price, you'll quickly see the return on this unique product."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000, which would be $1,250,000. Can we agree on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

While we could try to push for a bit more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,250,000 gives us a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
