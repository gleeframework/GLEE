"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $120 to start. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is quite a bit lower than I was hoping for. Could you meet me halfway at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $60 is low. How about we split the difference between your offer and my previous counteroffer?  Would you consider $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, which I appreciate.  While $75 is closer, I'm still looking for something closer to my last offer. Would you be willing to do $85?",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're getting closer!  $85 is a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $80? It's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy right now.",80.0,Bob,6,
