{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to counteroffer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to do? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell it for my absolute minimum just yet. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about $105? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $102.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $102.5 is just above my minimum and it's likely we won't get any closer. It's better to secure the sale now rather than risk further negotiation."
