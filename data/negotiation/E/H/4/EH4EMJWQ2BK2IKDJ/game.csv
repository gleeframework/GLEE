"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make a strong opening offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1200000. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950000 is a bit higher than I'd hoped for. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. It's a good deal for both of us - you're well above your desired price point, and I'm getting a great product for a price that works for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $850000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1200000. I think we're getting close to a deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to pay $875000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm not quite ready to give up on the premium value of this product. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $885000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",885000.0,Alice,5,
