"Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a truly unique product that holds immense value. My asking price is $2000000. This is a competitive price considering the potential benefits this product can offer. I'm confident it's a fair starting point for our discussion.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 is significantly below the true worth of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $1750000. This reflects a substantial discount and demonstrates my desire to reach an agreement. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the discount, but I still think $1750000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1375000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product without breaking the bank.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1375000 still falls below the value I've determined for this product.  To keep the conversation moving, I'm willing to come down to $1625000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects both the value and your budget.",1625000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1625000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering $1500000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product without breaking the bank.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
