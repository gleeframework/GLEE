"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  This product is worth a lot to me, but I need to stay within budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  I'm confident this price allows for a fair deal while still giving you a great value.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $875,000.  I believe this price is fair and allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue working towards a deal. While $875,000 is closer, it's still below my target. Let's try $890,000. This price is still very fair for both of us, and it would allow for a smooth transaction. I'm confident we can find common ground.",890000.0,Alice,5,
