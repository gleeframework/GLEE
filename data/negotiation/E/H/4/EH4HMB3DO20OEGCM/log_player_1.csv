Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  This product is worth a lot to me, but I need to stay within budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I have 10 rounds to negotiate and can still potentially reach a more favorable price with Bob. Additionally, I can always fall back on selling to John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  I'm confident this price allows for a fair deal while still giving you a great value.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $875,000.  I believe this price is fair and allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $875,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, it's still below my ideal target.  I have 6 rounds remaining and believe I can still potentially get closer to my desired price.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and can potentially achieve a better outcome.  If necessary, I can always sell to John for $800,000."
