Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,600,000 is a fair starting point for our discussion.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Negotiating significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price closer to your minimum ($1,200,000). 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer helps you understand how interested Bob is and how he values the product. His response will guide your next move.
* **Alternative Option:** You always have the safety net of John's offer ($1,200,000), allowing you to walk away from a deal with Bob if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,600,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, there's still potential to negotiate a higher price. His willingness to meet your minimum suggests he sees value in the product. Rejecting his offer and providing a counteroffer keeps the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I value your offer, the product's unique features and market potential make a price closer to $1,450,000 more realistic. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations and provide significant returns. How about we meet in the middle?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:**  You're moving closer to Bob's offer but staying firm above your minimum price.  The significant drop from your initial ask ($150,000) shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming high. 
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the product's unique value and potential return on investment can help justify the higher price in Bob's mind.
* **Compromise:** Suggesting a ""meeting in the middle"" encourages a collaborative negotiation approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has unique features, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a more substantial offer. How about $1,300,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer is a reasonable compromise. While it's not the highest possible price, it's still $100,000 above your guaranteed offer from John.  

Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away altogether. It's best to accept this offer and secure a profitable deal."
