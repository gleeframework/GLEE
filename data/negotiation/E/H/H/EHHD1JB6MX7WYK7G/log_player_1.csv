Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $9,500 is a good starting point as it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** The message highlights the value to Bob, making it more appealing. 
* **Openness to negotiation:** The message encourages Bob to engage in further discussion.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profits while also keeping the negotiation open and giving Bob an incentive to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,800 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and even lower than your initial offer of $9,500. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open, allowing you to potentially secure a higher price in subsequent rounds. 
* **John is a backup:**  Having John as a potential buyer provides a safety net in case the negotiation with Bob falls apart.

This strategy allows you to continue negotiating with Bob, aiming for a more favorable outcome while ensuring you have a guaranteed sale with John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,200. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but maintain leverage:** This counteroffer represents a compromise from your previous offer but still leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Emphasis on value:** Highlighting the value to Bob strengthens your position and encourages him to consider the offer.
* **Openness to negotiation:** The message keeps the door open for further discussion, signaling that you are willing to work with Bob.

This approach aims to find a middle ground while still ensuring you receive a price closer to your minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:**  Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  It's unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer. 
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob as a buyer entirely, especially since you have a guaranteed sale with John.

This strategy maximizes your potential earnings while also minimizing the risk of losing a sale altogether."
