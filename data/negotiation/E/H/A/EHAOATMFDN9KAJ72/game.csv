"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. What are your thoughts?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I've done some research and I'm not sure it's worth $22,000 to me. Can you meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob. However, the value of this product is significant, and $22,000 is a fair reflection of that. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  This offer takes into account the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, but I'm seeing if we can close this gap. How about we settle at $15,000? This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to the point where I might have to walk away, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. Can you accept this price?",14000.0,Bob,6,
