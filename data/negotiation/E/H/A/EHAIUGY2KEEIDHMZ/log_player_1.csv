Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point that gives Bob a chance to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit. I believe Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, I'm willing to risk a little more to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial price. I'm hopeful that this will be acceptable to him, as it's still a fair deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm starting to feel like this negotiation isn't going anywhere. I'm not willing to go lower than $10,000, which is what John is offering.  Therefore, I'm going to sell to John."
