{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my price range.  Considering its value to me, I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  I'm ready to finalize the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 11500}
