"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $120 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```
My reasoning:

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down and still reach a price you're happy with.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give me valuable information about his level of interest and potential budget. 
* **Alternative Option:** I have the safety net of John's $80 offer, so I can afford to be a bit more ambitious in my initial offer to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is Engaged:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's genuinely interested in the product. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While $90 is better than John's $80, there's still a gap between Bob's offer and my desired price. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open.
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:** I'll use the next round to make a counter-offer closer to his price but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle. How about $105? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 105}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counter-offer aims to split the difference between his offer ($90) and my previous asking price ($120), but slightly favors me.
* **Maintaining Value:** By not drastically dropping my price, I'm still conveying that the product holds significant value. 
* **Encouraging a Response:** This counter-offer is likely to keep Bob engaged and prompt him to either accept or propose another counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. How about $95? I'm willing to meet you halfway again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $95 is a solid profit above my minimum of $80.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  We've gone back and forth a few times. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob losing interest or the negotiation stalling further.
* **Time Value:** While I could potentially squeeze out a few more dollars, closing the deal now has value. I can move on to other potential sales."
