"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but not exorbitantly high to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer in a way that emphasizes the value of the product and encourages Bob to consider it. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message implies that I'm open to discussing the price, setting the stage for further interaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to find the product for a lower price. Could we possibly negotiate down to $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $140 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since Bob expressed interest in the product. 
* **Avoiding John:** While selling to John guarantees $150, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.  

I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $140 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $160?  This would still be a great price for you and allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer but am showing flexibility by suggesting a price in the middle of our previous offers. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product, suggesting that $160 is a good deal for him. 
* **Staying above minimum:** I'm keeping the price above my minimum of $150. 

Let's see if Bob accepts this counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe we can find common ground. Would $150 be acceptable for both of us? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $150 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.
* **No further gains:** There's no guarantee that I can get a better price from Bob in the following rounds, especially with John waiting to buy for the same price.
* **Avoiding risk:**  Continuing to negotiate risks that Bob might walk away, or that I might miss out on selling to John, leaving me with nothing.

It's a good deal for me, and it avoids unnecessary risk."
