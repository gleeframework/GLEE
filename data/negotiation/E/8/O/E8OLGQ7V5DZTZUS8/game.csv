"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $8,500? That's still a great price for a product worth $8,000, and it gives us both a fair deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate the offer, but I would like to stick to my original price of $8,000. This is the maximum I am willing to pay for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,
