{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  I'm flexible on price, so let's see if we can find a good deal that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with my desired price ($100) but leaving room for negotiation. This lets Bob know I'm open to his input and might be willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice. $100 is a bit above my budget. How about $85? I'm really interested in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a price closer to my desired $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. While $85 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $95? It's a good compromise for both of us, and it's still within your budget."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd really like to make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $90 isn't my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum threshold ($100) and it seems Bob is firm at this price. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely. It also avoids the potential for further negotiation that may take longer and lead to a lower final price."
