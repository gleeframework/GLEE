"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I have a truly unique product for sale, and I believe it could be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you first, but it's a high-value item, so I'm asking for $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $800000. This is a fair price, considering the potential benefit this product holds for me.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum value of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. While $800,000 is below my minimum,  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's potential value to you. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still outside my price range. While I understand the value of this product, my maximum budget is $800000. I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, given the potential benefits this product brings.  Let's find a way to make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been firm on his offer of $800,000, which is below my minimum value of $1,000,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, the chances of him budging further are slim, and I've already lost two rounds. Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me my minimum value and ensures a quicker transaction."
