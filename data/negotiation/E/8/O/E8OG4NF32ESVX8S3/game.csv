"Bob, I have a truly unique product for sale, and I believe it could be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you first, but it's a high-value item, so I'm asking for $1500000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $800000. This is a fair price, considering the potential benefit this product holds for me.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. While $800000 is below my minimum,  I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's potential value to you. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still outside my price range. While I understand the value of this product, my maximum budget is $800000. I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, given the potential benefits this product brings.  Let's find a way to make this deal work.",800000.0,Bob,4,
