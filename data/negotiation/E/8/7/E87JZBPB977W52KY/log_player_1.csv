Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're still making a profit of $4,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has a strong incentive to negotiate, knowing the product is worth more to him. 
* **It shows you're serious:** You're not starting at a ridiculously high price, showing you're open to a deal. 

We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a decent amount and more than selling to John, it's still below our ideal profit margin.  We can likely do better.  By rejecting, we can counter-offer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500, but I'm not flexible on that price. I'm starting to think about buying from John, though. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting to get close to John's offer. If we reject, we risk losing him completely and ending up with John's lower offer.  $9,500 is still a decent profit, and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  It's time to take the deal."
