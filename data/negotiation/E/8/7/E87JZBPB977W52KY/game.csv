"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500, but I'm not flexible on that price. I'm starting to think about buying from John, though.",9500.0,Bob,4,
