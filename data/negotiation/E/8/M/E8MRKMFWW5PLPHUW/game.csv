"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $170 to start. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for offering, but $170 is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for the product. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that my initial price was a bit high for you. However, $60 is too low for me to consider. Could you meet me halfway at $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $75? That's a fair compromise, I think.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us.  While $75 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to go down to $100.  This is my final offer.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $100 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  I could meet you halfway at $87.50. Let me know what you think.",87.5,Bob,6,
