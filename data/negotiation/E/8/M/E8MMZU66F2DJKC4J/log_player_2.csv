"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. There's no reason to accept this offer.  It's better to reject and start negotiating."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  However, $1,200,000 is a significant gap from what I had in mind. To move this forward, I could consider $1,800,000.  This reflects the product's true worth and potential for your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,800,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to try and get a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value this product highly, but $1,800,000 is still beyond my comfort zone.  I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. It's a substantial amount, and I believe we can close this deal at this price. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
