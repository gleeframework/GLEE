{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $14,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  By offering a price slightly below my minimum acceptable value ($15,000), I can potentially secure a deal while also leaving space for Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm framing the message in a way that emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. 

**Next Steps:** 

* **Bob accepts:**  Great! I've secured a sale for $14,000.
* **Bob rejects:**  I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer based on how close it is to my minimum acceptable value. If it's significantly lower than my minimum, I'll consider selling to John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product and am interested in purchasing it. However, I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my valuation of $12000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, he has shown interest and is willing to negotiate. I believe there's still potential to reach a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Risk of Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit, it's also a missed opportunity to potentially get closer to my maximum profit.  I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob first.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll aim for a price that's closer to my minimum value but still reflects Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $13,500 is a compromise between my initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,000. This shows I'm willing to meet him halfway. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value by saying it's still a ""great deal"" even at $13,500.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing fairness by highlighting that this price allows me to make a ""fair profit"". This appeals to Bob's sense of equity. 

**Next Steps:** 

* **Bob accepts:**  I've secured a sale for $13,500, which is a good outcome.
* **Bob rejects:**  I'll have to weigh his next counteroffer against my minimum acceptable value and the risk of selling to John. If Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I may accept it. Otherwise, I'll make another counteroffer or consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget and the current market situation, I would like to propose a price of $13000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is only $500 below my minimum acceptable value of $13,500. 
* **Negotiation Exhaustion:** We've already been through several rounds of negotiation. It's unlikely Bob will budge much further.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject his offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'll be left with no sale.

**Next Steps:**

* I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $13,000. This is a reasonable outcome, considering I've already negotiated a price close to my minimum acceptable value."
