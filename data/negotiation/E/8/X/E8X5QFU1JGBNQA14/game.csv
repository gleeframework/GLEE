"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the product's value is quite a bit higher than that to me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $9,000.  It's a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
