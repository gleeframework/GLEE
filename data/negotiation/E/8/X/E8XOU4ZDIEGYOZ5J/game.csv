"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a steal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $820,000. It's still a great deal for me, and I'm willing to make a commitment to buy the product from you.",820000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $820,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this work. Let's meet in the middle at $860,000. What do you say?",860000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $860,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $820,000 and $860,000, so how about $830,000?",830000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $830,000 is still too far below my minimum.  Let's try $850,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to go that high, I'm going to have to sell to John.",850000.0,Alice,5,
