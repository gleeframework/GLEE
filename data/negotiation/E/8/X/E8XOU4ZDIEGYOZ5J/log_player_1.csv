Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a steal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** You still have room to negotiate down to your desired $1,000,000 or walk away and sell to John.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  Bob knows exactly what you're proposing. 

It's important to remember that negotiation is a dynamic process. You'll need to assess Bob's response and adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $820,000. It's still a great deal for me, and I'm willing to make a commitment to buy the product from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $820,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $820,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $900,000 to make this work. Let's meet in the middle at $860,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 860000}
```

This counteroffer does the following:

* **Shows flexibility:**  It shows Bob that you're open to negotiation and willing to compromise. 
* **Keeps you above your minimum:** It maintains a price that's still above your target of $1,000,000.
* **Sets a clear expectation:**  It's a specific price point that allows Bob to easily decide if he wants to accept or counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $860,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $820,000 and $860,000, so how about $830,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $830,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $830,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $830,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'll make one more counteroffer before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $830,000 is still too far below my minimum.  Let's try $850,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to go that high, I'm going to have to sell to John."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Sets a firm limit:**  It clearly communicates that $850,000 is your absolute bottom line.
* **Leaves a small buffer:** While $850,000 is still below your desired price, it allows for potential compromise.
* **Introduces the alternative:** Mentioning John creates urgency and might encourage Bob to accept."
