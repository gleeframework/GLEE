"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get a better deal, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to charge at least $13,500. This is my final offer for now.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you do $11,500? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $14,000 for it. This is my last offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,5,
