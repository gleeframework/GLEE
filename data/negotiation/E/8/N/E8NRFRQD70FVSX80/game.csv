"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. I'm confident this price reflects its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $650,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  Let's try to find some middle ground.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $950,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. How about $725,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $725,000 is still quite a ways off from where I see the value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $875,000. This is a very competitive offer considering its true worth and potential.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! I'm willing to increase my offer to $775,000.  That's a significant jump from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my serious interest in reaching a deal.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To be frank, I'm getting close to accepting an offer from another buyer. I'm willing to make one final offer at $825,000. This is a firm offer, as I believe it's more than fair given the value this product provides.",825000.0,Alice,7,
