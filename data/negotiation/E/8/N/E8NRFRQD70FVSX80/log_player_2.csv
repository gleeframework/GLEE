Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $650,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  Let's try to find some middle ground.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $725,000 is still quite a ways off from where I see the value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $875,000. This is a very competitive offer considering its true worth and potential.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To be frank, I'm getting close to accepting an offer from another buyer. I'm willing to make one final offer at $825,000. This is a firm offer, as I believe it's more than fair given the value this product provides.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball and her latest offer is still above your maximum budget. While she claims to have another buyer, there's no guarantee it's true. You have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000, ensuring you stay within your budget. It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Alice and potentially ending up with no deal at all."
