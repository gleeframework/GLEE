"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. This product is truly valuable and I'm confident it can bring you a lot of benefits. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, thanks for the offer and for recognizing the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $13,000 is too low for me.  How about $15,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",15500.0,Alice,5,
