"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less from John.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if she'll come down closer to his $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit higher than I can comfortably go right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,750. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still get the product for a better price from John. He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,750 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really trying to stay within my budget, and $9,000 is the absolute most I can do right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $9,250. It's a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice is coming down in price, but she's still above his maximum budget.  He's already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's likely Alice won't budge any further. It's better to lock in the price from John and avoid the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice."
