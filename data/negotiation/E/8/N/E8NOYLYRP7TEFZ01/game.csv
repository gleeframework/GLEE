"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit higher than I can comfortably go right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,750. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,750 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really trying to stay within my budget, and $9,000 is the absolute most I can do right now.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $9,250. It's a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product brings to your business.",9250.0,Alice,5,
