"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This gives you a good deal, and it's fair to me as well.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,250, which is closer to your offer but still represents a fair price for the product's value.  Let's reach an agreement and finalize this sale.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,250 and my previous offer of $8,750. Would you be willing to go down to $9,012.50? That's the best I can do.",9012.5,Bob,6,
