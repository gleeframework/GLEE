"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000?  This gives us both a good deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,325,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
