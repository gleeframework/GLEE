"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. It's a game-changer in its field, and I believe it could significantly benefit your business. Given its value to you, I understand its worth is estimated at $15,000. My offer to you is to purchase this product for $14,000, which I believe strikes a fair balance between our interests. I'm confident you'll find the investment worthwhile. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or if you have any questions. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you have a fallback option with John at $15,000. There's a chance you could get a better price from Alice with further negotiation."
