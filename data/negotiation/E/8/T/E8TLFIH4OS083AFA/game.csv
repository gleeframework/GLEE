"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find very valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is quite a ways off from what I can accept.  To move this forward, I could consider $1,950,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,950,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,600,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
