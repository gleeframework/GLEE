"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",60.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,90.0
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $75? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,85.0
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, but I think $75 is still a bit low for me. How about we compromise at $85? It's a fair price that should work for both of us.",85.0,Alice,5,,
