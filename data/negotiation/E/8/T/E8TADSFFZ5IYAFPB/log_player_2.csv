# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously crafted to meet your needs. With its exceptional features and quality, it's truly a valuable asset. Considering its worth to us and the benefits it provides, I propose a price of $95 for you to experience all that this product has to offer. I believe this is a fair deal that reflects both the value of the product and your anticipated satisfaction. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

While Alice's message is persuasive, $95 is still more than you're willing to pay. You know John will sell it to you for $80, making that the better option."
