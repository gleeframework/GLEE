Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
