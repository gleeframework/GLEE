Alice's offer is too high. It's better to try and negotiate with Alice."

I'm offering Alice $7,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from her initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering my budget."

I'm offering Alice $7,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and her last one. It's still within my budget, but hopefully, it's closer to what Alice is willing to accept."

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still more than what I'm willing to pay. I've already made several counteroffers, and it seems she's not budging much.  To avoid further negotiation, I'm going to buy from John for $8,000."
