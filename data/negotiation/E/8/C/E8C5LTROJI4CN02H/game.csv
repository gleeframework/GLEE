"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go as low as $950,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This would still be a significant deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a new offer of $1,025,000. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
