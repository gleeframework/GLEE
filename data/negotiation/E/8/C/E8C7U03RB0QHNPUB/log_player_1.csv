{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. It also highlights the value of the product for Bob, making the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $85? I'm sure we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $95 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $90 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's better to sell the product to John for $120, ensuring I get a good price and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
