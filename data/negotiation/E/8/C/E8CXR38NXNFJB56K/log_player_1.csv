Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $130, but I'm looking to pay closer to $110. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $110 is too low, and I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $120.  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm still holding out for a better price. $115 is closer to my ideal price point, but I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'm going to counter offer one more time and see if Bob is willing to come up a little higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $118? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 118}
