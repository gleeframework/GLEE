"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $130. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You can likely get a better deal than $130, so it's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $130, but I'm looking to pay closer to $110. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $120.  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You can still likely get a better price than $120. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate Alice down a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $120, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $115.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at that price?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $118? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Alice has come down to $118, which is close to your target of $115.  You've got 5 rounds left and the risk of going to John is significant.  Accepting the offer is a reasonable choice."
