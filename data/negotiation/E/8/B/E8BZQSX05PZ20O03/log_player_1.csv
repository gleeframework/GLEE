Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this offer."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a high price close to your minimum acceptable price ($15,000) maximizes potential profit if Bob accepts.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** The message is designed to be open-ended, allowing you to gauge Bob's interest level and adjust your approach if needed. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you don't have information about Bob's willingness to pay beyond $8,000. 
* There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer, but you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John."
