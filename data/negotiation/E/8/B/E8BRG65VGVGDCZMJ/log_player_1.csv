"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. As a starting point, I'm offering it for $16,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room to negotiate down and still achieve a price you're happy with.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By starting high, we can get a sense of how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:** Having the offer from John for $12,000 gives us a strong fallback position. We don't need to be desperate, and can walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches our minimum acceptable price, we still have room to negotiate.  We started high, so it's expected he'd counter lower. We'll try to meet in the middle and aim for a price closer to our initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. How about we meet in the middle?  Would you consider $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're signaling a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Middle Ground:** $14,000 is a fair compromise, splitting the difference between his counteroffer ($12,000) and our initial offer ($16,000).
* **Maintaining Value:** We're still aiming for a price significantly higher than our minimum, reflecting the product's value to us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,000. Would you be willing to go down to $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $13,500 is a solid profit above our minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Stronger Position:** Bob increased his offer, suggesting he's motivated and values the product.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations might not yield a significantly better outcome, and we risk Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting now secures a good deal."
