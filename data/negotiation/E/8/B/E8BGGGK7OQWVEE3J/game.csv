"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I understand the product's value to you, but I also need to ensure a fair return on my investment. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? It's a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better. How about $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
