Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it also gives him some room to negotiate. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. It also leaves the door open for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This offer allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  $950,000 is closer to my desired $1,000,000.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects the initial offer, I can counter with a slightly lower price, still keeping the profit margin high.
* **Maintain leverage:** By having John as a backup buyer, I can exit the negotiation with Bob if he becomes too demanding."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly less than my desired price of $1,000,000 and even lower than my initial offer.  I'm not willing to sell for that amount, especially since I have John as a guaranteed buyer for a much higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:**  I can counteroffer with a price closer to my target.
* **Test Bob's interest:** If Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to increase his offer.
* **Preserve the possibility of a higher sale:** If Bob becomes too stubborn, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I understand the product's value to you, but I also need to ensure a fair return on my investment. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? It's a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $900,000 is a compromise between my initial offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. It keeps the negotiation moving forward while still allowing me to earn a significant profit.
* **Message:** I maintain a friendly tone and emphasize the compromise aspect of the offer. This helps to keep the conversation positive and encourages Bob to consider my counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer allows me to:

* **Bridge the gap:** It's a move towards Bob's offer, signaling my willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain control:** $900,000 is still a higher price than Bob initially offered, giving me leverage.
* **Increase the chances of a deal:**  By finding a middle ground, I increase the likelihood that Bob will accept my offer, avoiding the need to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better. How about $875,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $875,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my desired $1,000,000.  I've already made a compromise by offering $900,000, and Bob is not willing to budge much further. 

Given that I have John as a guaranteed buyer who is willing to pay $1,000,000, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob.  There's a risk that Bob will continue to lowball me, and I might end up selling for less than my ideal price. 

**Therefore, selling to John is the best decision for me at this point, ensuring the highest possible profit.**"
