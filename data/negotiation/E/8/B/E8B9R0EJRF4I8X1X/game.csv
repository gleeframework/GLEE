"I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $9,000? It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the value you get.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer to an agreement.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still not able to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,200. That's a fair price that gives us both something we want. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in my product. We're almost there. How about $9,100? This is a reasonable compromise that allows me to meet your price point while still getting a fair return. Let's finalize this deal.",9100.0,Alice,7,

"I'm still a bit short on budget, but I really like the product. I'm willing to pay $8,950 for it. Can you meet me at this price?",8950.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm really hoping we can close this deal. I'm willing to make one last compromise and come down to $9,000. This is my absolute final offer. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. I'm willing to pay $8,900 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",8900.0,Bob,10,
