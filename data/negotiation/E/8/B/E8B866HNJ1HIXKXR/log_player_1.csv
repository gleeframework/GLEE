Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a potential offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit but also ensure Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little room for Bob to see value and might scare him off.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1150000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It's short, positive, and highlights the product's ""unique"" value.
* **The Price:** $1,150,000 gives Bob a $50,000 discount (incentivizing him) while securing you a $150,000 profit.

**Important Note:**  This assumes you don't know Bob's absolute maximum willingness to pay.  If you had more information, you might push the price higher."
