"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850000.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay closer to $850000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $875000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $875000, but I'm still hoping to find a price closer to $850000. How about we split the difference and settle on $862500? This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",862500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going below $900000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you the product for $880000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",880000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  $880000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $865000.  This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",865000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too close to my minimum price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $870000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",870000.0,Alice,7,
