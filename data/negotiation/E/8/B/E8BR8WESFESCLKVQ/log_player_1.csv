Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly valuable to you, and I want to give you a fair opportunity to benefit from it. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,100,000 before I move to other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's an opportunity to make even more profit if Bob accepts a lower price. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer of $1,100,000 is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), giving us room to negotiate if needed.
    * Still highly attractive compared to our guaranteed sale price, maximizing potential profit.
* **Time Consideration:** The message implies we have other buyers (""other interested parties""), creating a sense of urgency and potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still maintaining the security of the guaranteed sale to John."
