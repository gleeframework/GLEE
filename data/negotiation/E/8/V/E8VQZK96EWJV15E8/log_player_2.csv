Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $1,400,000 is getting closer, but I need to stay above my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $1,500,000 which is your alternative option with John. It's best to secure the product at the known price with John rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
