{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a competitive price of $1,750,000.  It's a great value considering its worth to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Let's start our negotiation off strong!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I see the value in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a maximum of $1,500,000 for it. How about we meet in the middle?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my ideal price, it's still above my minimum.  I'm not going to accept this offer immediately.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise closer to my desired price.  I've got 9 more rounds to work with, so there's no need to rush into a deal that's not mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is lower than I hoped for, I understand you have a budget. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,600,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we settle at $1,400,000? This offer reflects a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while working within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm not willing to settle for $1,400,000 just yet.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum and see if we can reach a compromise.  I still have 6 more rounds to work with and don't want to lose out on a potential higher profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $1,400,000 is getting closer, but I need to stay above my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000.
