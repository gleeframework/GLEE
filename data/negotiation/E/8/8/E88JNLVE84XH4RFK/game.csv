"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $120, Bob, but I was thinking we could even go a bit higher. How about $125? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings",125.0,Alice,5,
