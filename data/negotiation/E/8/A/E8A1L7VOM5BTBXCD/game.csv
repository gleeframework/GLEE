"Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,400,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,350,000? This price still leaves a considerable margin for you and is closer to my desired price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,320,000.  This price is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1320000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,260,000 simply doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise and gives you a good deal. Let's make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
