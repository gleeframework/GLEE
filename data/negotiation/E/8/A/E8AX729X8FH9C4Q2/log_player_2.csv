It's always best to try and negotiate a lower price, especially in the first round. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm starting with a significant discount to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  This is a strong starting point and gives us room to maneuver in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

We're getting closer, but we can still try to negotiate further. It's worth another round to see if we can get a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

We're going to make a smaller jump this time, showing Alice that we're serious about getting a deal done, but still pushing for a better price."
