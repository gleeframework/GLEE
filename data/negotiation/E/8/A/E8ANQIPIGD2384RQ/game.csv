"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've been carefully developing, and I'm confident it's worth at least $15,000 to someone with your expertise.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This price reflects a significant discount while still ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,1,
