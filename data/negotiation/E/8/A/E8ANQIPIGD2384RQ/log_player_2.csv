"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've been carefully developing, and I'm confident it's worth at least $15,000 to someone with your expertise.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This price reflects a significant discount while still ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** While Alice's initial message is a bit inflated, her final offer of $12,000 is still significantly lower than John's price of $15,000.
* **Saving money is the priority:** Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Accepting Alice's offer saves him $3,000 compared to buying from John."
