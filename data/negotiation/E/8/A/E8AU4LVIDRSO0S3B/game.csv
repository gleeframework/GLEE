"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this incredible asset. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a competitive price of $750,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $800,000 to you. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get closer to your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a new price of $725,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
