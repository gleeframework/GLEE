Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a strategic move. It allows me to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If Bob is truly interested, he may be willing to negotiate down from this price. 
* **Maximize potential profit:** If Bob accepts, I get a significant profit.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  I have room to lower the price if necessary, without going below my minimum acceptable value of $8,000. 

It's important to note that I'm aware this is a high starting point. However, I believe it's worth the risk to see if I can secure a better deal than what John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $7,500 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $8,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm countering with $8,500. This is a compromise that:

* **Is above my minimum:** This ensures I'm still making a profit.
* **Is closer to Bob's offer:** This shows I'm willing to negotiate and meet him halfway.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $8,000. While I would prefer to make more, Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price. 

I've reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of wasting time.  Selling to John guarantees me a profit and provides certainty."
