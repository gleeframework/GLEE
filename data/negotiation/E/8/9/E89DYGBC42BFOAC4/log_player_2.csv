"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $950,000 is below your maximum, it's still quite a bit more than Alice's value of $800,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price. 
* **John's offer is a fallback:** If negotiations with Alice fail, you can always go to John for a price of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects its value to me and leaves room for you to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is reasonable:**  $850,000 is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above her minimum value, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on value:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product to both parties, aiming for a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Opens the door for further discussion:**  The counteroffer creates an opportunity for further negotiation and potentially finding a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to recoup more of the value of the product.  I'm willing to go down to $900,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  Alice's offer of $900,000 is lower than her previous offer, but it's still above my ideal price. There's still room to negotiate further.
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  Rejecting this offer allows me to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my target of $850,000.
* **John remains a fallback:**  If negotiations with Alice stall, I can always go to John for $1,000,000."
