I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this offer is attractive enough for Bob to consider, while also giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation,  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I will counteroffer and try to reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $850,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise that could be attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, his offers are becoming too low. I'm confident that I can get a better price from John."
