Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $119, you are aiming to capture the maximum possible profit from Bob while still ensuring he gets a deal that's $1 better than his perceived value. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible sale price before resorting to the guaranteed $100 offer from John."
