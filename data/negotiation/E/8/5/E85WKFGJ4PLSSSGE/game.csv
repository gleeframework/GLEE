"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking for a good price for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,800. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,800 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm ready to pay $8,600 for the product. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal.",8600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,600. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,700. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",8700.0,Alice,5,
