"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to resist. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I agree this product is valuable, but  $800,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider  $500,000? That feels like a fairer price point to me.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $500,000. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $700,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $600,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the market value of similar products. Would that work for you?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $600,000. Considering the value it brings to you, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $650,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,
