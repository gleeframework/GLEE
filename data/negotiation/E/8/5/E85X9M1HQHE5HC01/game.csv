"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a significant gap from my initial asking price. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your operations.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the product's value, but $1,150,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
