"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential and worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussions."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong opening:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and your minimum sets a strong anchoring point for the negotiation. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""potential and worth"" helps justify the high initial price.
* **Room to Negotiate:**  This initial offer provides ample room for negotiation over the subsequent rounds. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping John's offer in mind ($1,200,000) gives you a safety net and leverage in the negotiation. You won't feel pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is moving in the right direction, it's still significantly below your target price and even further from your initial ask.  Rejecting now signals that you're serious about getting a price closer to your valuation. You have time to negotiate and the safety net of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While I understand your budgetary constraints, the value of this product is truly significant.  I could consider closing the deal for $1,550,000. This reflects the product's worth and my willingness to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** You've reduced your price by $50,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** Re-emphasizing the product's value reinforces your position and justifies the still-high asking price.
* **Middle Ground:** This offer aims for a middle ground between Bob's counteroffer and your previous price, encouraging him to move closer to your target. 
* **Urgency:** By framing it as a potential closing price, you add a touch of urgency without being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered Alice's latest offer, and while it's an improvement, I'm still looking to keep the cost below $1,500,000. My counteroffer is $1,450,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is negotiating in $50,000 increments, which is a good sign that he's serious. However, we're still significantly above his perceived value of $1,000,000.  It's worth pushing a bit further to see if we can close the gap, knowing that we have John's offer as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To demonstrate my commitment to getting this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By stating this is your final offer, you create a sense of urgency and emphasize the need for Bob to make a decision. 
* **Compromise:** Meeting Bob at his $1,500,000 limit shows you're willing to compromise, but only to a certain point. 
* **Justification:**  Reiterating that this is a significant compromise reinforces that you've moved substantially from your initial asking price.
* **Preparing for Next Steps:** This firm stance will help you gauge Bob's true interest and prepare for a potential walk-away scenario if he doesn't accept. You still have John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. My final counteroffer is $1,475,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob has moved substantially from his initial offer and has now countered your ""final offer."" This indicates a strong desire to purchase.
* **Minimal Gains:**  While you could try to negotiate further, the potential gains at this point are relatively small (only $25,000).
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob walking away, potentially leaving you with a less favorable deal from John. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  With only a few rounds remaining, accepting now secures a very good price and avoids the risk of running out of time.

Accepting Bob's offer of $1,475,000 provides a significant profit above your minimum and allows you to close the deal confidently."
