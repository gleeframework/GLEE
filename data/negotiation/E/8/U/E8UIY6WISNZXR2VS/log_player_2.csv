{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the value of your product, $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close, but we're not willing to go all the way to $775000. We're willing to make one more concession. We're proposing a price of $810000. This is our final offer, and we're confident it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $810,000, which is within a reasonable range of our target price of $750,000.  While we could potentially get a lower price with more rounds, the risk of Alice walking away or us having to buy from John at a higher price is significant. Accepting this offer allows us to secure the product at a reasonable price, saving us a considerable amount compared to buying from John."
