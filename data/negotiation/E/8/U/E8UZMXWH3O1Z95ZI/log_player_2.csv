"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a significant discount from its true value, and I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $1,200,000. That's still too high for Bob, who's willing to pay a maximum of $800,000. It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my valuation. I hope you'll consider this counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $800000 is simply too low for me to consider. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which is still a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere. This reflects the value you'll gain from the product, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,000,000 is still significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm committed to buying this product, but my maximum budget is $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business and the fact that I am a serious buyer.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $800000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm determined to make this deal work, but we need to find a solution that's fair to both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $900000. This is a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere, and it allows you to gain the value of this product while still staying within a reasonable budget.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has come down to $900,000, which is closer to Bob's budget, but it's still $100,000 higher. While there's a chance Alice might come down further, Bob has already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation and it's likely that she won't budge much more. Given that Bob has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000, it's the safer and more financially sound decision to buy from John at this point."
