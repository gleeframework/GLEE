"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a significant discount from its true value, and I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my valuation. I hope you'll consider this counteroffer.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $800000 is simply too low for me to consider. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which is still a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere. This reflects the value you'll gain from the product, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. ",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still too high for me. I'm committed to buying this product, but my maximum budget is $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business and the fact that I am a serious buyer.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $800000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm determined to make this deal work, but we need to find a solution that's fair to both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $900000. This is a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere, and it allows you to gain the value of this product while still staying within a reasonable budget.  Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Alice,5,
