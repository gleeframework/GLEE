"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a significant discount from its true value, and I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's high enough to maximize my potential profit while still being within a range that Bob might consider. 
* **Justifying the Price:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""discount"" to make it more appealing and highlight the value Bob would be getting.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for negotiation. I'm ready to discuss further, but I'm not desperate to sell immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my valuation. I hope you'll consider this counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's interested. There's room for further negotiation, and I can likely get a better price by rejecting his counteroffer and making my own. 
* **Time to play hardball:**  Since I have 10 rounds to negotiate, I can afford to be a bit more aggressive and push for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere. This reflects the value you'll gain from the product, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** I'm not accepting Bob's lowball offer, but I'm showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's closer to the middle ground, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility without giving away too much.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will receive, reminding him that even at $1,000,000, he's getting a good deal. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and focuses on finding a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still too high for me. I'm committed to buying this product, but my maximum budget is $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business and the fact that I am a serious buyer.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While Bob is expressing commitment to the product, his offer remains stubbornly at $800,000, which is far below my minimum acceptable price.
* **More rounds left:** I still have plenty of time to negotiate, and the risk of losing the sale to John is still relatively low.
* **Positioning for a better deal:** By consistently rejecting Bob's low offers, I'm setting the stage for potentially getting a better price in the future. He's already shown that he wants this product, and with a few more rounds, I might be able to push him closer to my desired price point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $800,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm determined to make this deal work, but we need to find a solution that's fair to both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere, and it allows you to gain the value of this product while still staying within a reasonable budget.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Showing flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise further, moving my price down from $1,000,000 to $900,000.
* **Highlighting the discount:** I'm emphasizing that even at $900,000, Bob is still getting a good deal compared to what I could get elsewhere. 
* **Focusing on shared success:**  I'm emphasizing that finding a solution that works for both of us is the key to making the deal happen.
* **Maintaining firmness:** While I'm moving towards Bob's offer, I'm not conceding to his initial price. I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my target."
