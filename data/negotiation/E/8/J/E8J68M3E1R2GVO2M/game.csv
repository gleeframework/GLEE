"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet somewhere in the middle of that and $90?",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $100.50. It's the closest I can get to my target without going below my minimum acceptable price. What do you think?",100.5,Alice,5,
