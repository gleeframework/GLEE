Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $95 for it."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price with some counter-offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  I'm sure you'll find the product is worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. Can we try $80? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd love to keep negotiating with Bob, he's now offering my minimum price. Since John is also willing to pay this amount, I'm going to choose to sell to John. This guarantees me a sale without risking further negotiation and potential loss of profit."
