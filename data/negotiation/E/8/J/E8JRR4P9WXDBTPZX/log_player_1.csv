"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000.  This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and hopefully incentivizes Bob to engage in the process.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I consider fair.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and try to close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000.  This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, but still protects my interests. I hope this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $850,000 is getting closer to his value, it's still far below my minimum.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

I'm going to counter with $925,000. This is a slightly lower offer than my previous one, but still closer to my minimum value than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping that this will be a compromise that Bob will find acceptable, as we're both getting closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  The negotiations with Bob have gone on for several rounds, and while we're getting closer to a deal, it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet me at a price I'm comfortable with.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, and I'm not willing to risk losing that for the chance that Bob might come around in the next few rounds."
