"Bob, I have a unique product that I think would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits. Let me know your thoughts!",12000.0,Alice,1,
