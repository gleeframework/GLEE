"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  This will give me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  I'll be watching closely to see if Bob is interested and how his counteroffer looks. If he rejects, I'll assess whether to lower the price or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,650,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and it shows I'm willing to be flexible. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob to agree, but I'm still prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We've been going back and forth, and this offer is just a little bit below my counteroffer, and much closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I don't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially ending up with a lower price, or having to settle for selling to John. It's time to close the deal!"
