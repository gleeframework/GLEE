"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good deal, it's still not the best possible price. I want to see if I can negotiate further and potentially get it for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. Would you be willing to accept $900,000? I believe this is still a fair price considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $925,000. This is still a great value considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $925,000 is a good compromise.  It's a significant savings compared to buying from John, and it's closer to my target price than her initial offer. There's always a risk that further negotiation could lower the price even more, but I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
