Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly beneficial for you.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  This is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price without seeming overly aggressive.  

This strategy aims to secure the best possible outcome with Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
