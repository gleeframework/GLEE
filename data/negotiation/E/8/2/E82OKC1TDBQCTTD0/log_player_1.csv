"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for the price to make it seem fair. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message clearly indicates I'm open to negotiation. 
* **Next Steps:** I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy for the next round, keeping in mind my minimum price and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is Key:** I still have 9 rounds to negotiate a better price. There's a good chance I can get closer to my desired price.
* **John as a Backup:**  While I'm open to negotiating, I'm not desperate. I have a guaranteed buyer in John, which provides leverage.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum,  while still being open to negotiation. The goal is to find a middle ground that allows me to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to see if we can find common ground. Let's keep talking."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate by reducing my price, but still staying above my minimum.
* **Middle Ground:** $1,600,000 is a reasonable compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer.
* **Maintain Optimism:**  My message is positive and encouraging, indicating a desire to continue the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects it again, I may consider making a smaller concession in the next round. However, I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** We've only had 4 rounds, and I have a solid backup option in John. I can afford to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer again, but this time I'll reduce my price by a smaller amount. My goal is to slowly close the gap while still maintaining leverage. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option, especially if the negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit below what I can realistically accept.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,450,000. This offer is fair to both of us, and allows me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:**  I'm reducing my price by only $50,000 this time, showing I'm getting closer to a final price, but not giving in easily.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** $1,450,000 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer.
* **Finality:**  I'm adding a sense of finality to my message, suggesting I'm nearing my limit for negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. If he still rejects it, I'll consider making a very small concession in the next round, but I'll also start mentally preparing to accept John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $1,400,000 is only $100,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Time:** We're now in round 6, leaving only 4 rounds to negotiate. Time is running out.
* **Risk of John:**  If I keep rejecting Bob's offers, I risk losing the sale to John entirely.  It's not guaranteed John will still be interested in 4 rounds.

**Next Steps:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice at this point. It minimizes risk and secures a sale that's fairly close to my minimum."
