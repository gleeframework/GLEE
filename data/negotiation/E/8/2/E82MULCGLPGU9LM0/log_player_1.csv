Bob's offer:

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal and significantly better than selling to John. It's important to recognize that Bob is likely willing to pay a bit more, but the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially losing him entirely is too high."
