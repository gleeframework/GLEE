Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $10,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $12,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $10,000.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming close to Bob's $12,000 valuation is ideal. However, being too aggressive could make Bob reject the offer.

**Possible Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500, which reflects its worth and potential benefits."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is positive, emphasizes value, and provides a reason for the price.
* **Price:** $11,500 leaves room for negotiation but secures a significant portion of the potential profit. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might lower your initial offer slightly.
* **Relationship:** If building a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a fairer price might be strategic. 

**Remember:** This is just one possible offer. The best approach depends on your overall negotiation strategy and any additional information you might have about Bob."
