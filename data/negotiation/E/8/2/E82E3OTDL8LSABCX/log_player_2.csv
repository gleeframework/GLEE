"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is less than Alice's value of $1,200,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about the price, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price of $1,000,000.  While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might become unwilling to lower the price further, or that Bob could end up paying more than $1,075,000. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price that's within his budget and saves him the potential risk of a longer negotiation."
