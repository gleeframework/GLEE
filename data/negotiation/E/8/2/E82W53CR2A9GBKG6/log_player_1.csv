Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first before listing it publicly. I think it would be very valuable to you! I'm willing to part with it for $110."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $120, aiming slightly higher with Bob could increase your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's interested, but still ensures you're well above your minimum. 
* **Appeal to Scarcity and Value:**  By mentioning you're offering it to him before a public listing, you subtly imply the product is desirable and in demand."
