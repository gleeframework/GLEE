"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 18000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.  I'm confident in selling to John for $15,000 if needed, so this initial offer leaves room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. I'm able to sell the product for my minimum desired price, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a failed deal."
