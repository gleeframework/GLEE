"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far above your budget. It makes more sense to reject and try to negotiate a better price. You still have 9 rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it signals that I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if needed. My goal is to see how flexible Alice is on the price and hopefully start a conversation towards a more agreeable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my budget, I still have time to negotiate further and try to get a better deal. Rejecting allows me to send another counteroffer and see if I can bring her down closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still trying to get a good deal.  $750,000 is within my budget and hopefully closer to Alice's ideal price.  I'm aiming for a compromise, but I'm also aware that I can still walk away and buy from John if Alice won't budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my target price. It's closer than previous offers, but I still have time to try and negotiate further. I'm going to reject and make another counteroffer. While the risk of losing the deal to another buyer increases with each round, I want to exhaust all options to see if I can get the price down to something closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is my final counteroffer. I'm pushing for the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. It's right at my budget limit, and if Alice accepts, it will be a good deal for me.  I'm aware that she might reject it, but I'm running out of rounds and need to make a firm stand. If she rejects, I'll move to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and with only 3 rounds remaining, the risk of not finding a suitable price is high. I've reached my limit and can't justify negotiating further.  It's time to accept the guaranteed price from John. While it's not my ideal deal, it's the most secure way to get the product within my budget and avoid the potential of a lengthy negotiation that might not yield a satisfactory outcome."
