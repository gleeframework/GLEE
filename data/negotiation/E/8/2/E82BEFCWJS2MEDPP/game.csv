"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd like to see some flexibility from your side as well.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,000,000?  This reflects the product's true value while still offering you a significant deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to compromise further and propose $950,000.
