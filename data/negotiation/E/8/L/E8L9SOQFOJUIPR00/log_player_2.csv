You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

You can do better than $10,000. It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

While $9,500 is closer to your desired price, you can still do better. Reject the offer and try to get Alice to come down even further."
