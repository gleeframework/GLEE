"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm asking for $14,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,500 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's value of $12,000. There's room for negotiation, so it's worth rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that is fair to both parties.  He's offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her value of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob. However, $13,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $14,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price. While it's closer to his budget, there's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a better price. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,500. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again offering a price that's in the middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's counteroffer.  He's demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and meet halfway, but he's still trying to secure a good deal for himself.  This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but wants a fair price."
