I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum value of $12,000, but it's still a potentially attractive price for Bob if he values the product higher. 

If he rejects, I can fall back on John's offer of $12,000, so there's no risk involved in making a higher offer."
