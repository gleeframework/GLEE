Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a price that:

* **Is higher than Bob's valuation:**  He values the product at $8,000, so he has some room to negotiate.
* **Is lower than my fallback option:**  I can sell it to John for $10,000, so I'm willing to take a slight discount to secure a sale with Bob. 

This strategy maximizes my chances of getting a sale with Bob while still getting a price closer to my desired value."
