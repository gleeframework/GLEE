"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,100,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your position.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $950,000 falls short of what I believe is fair.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. I believe this price represents a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob still has room to negotiate a better price.  Alice has already lowered her price from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000.  There's a good chance she'll be willing to come down further to get the sale.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $950,000."
