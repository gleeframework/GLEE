"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering its worth $12,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. There's room for both of you to find a price that works.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $9,500 is a bit high for me. Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This price is fair to both of us and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its worth $12,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $12,000, and it's likely that further negotiation won't get a much lower price.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $3,000 compared to buying from John, and it's a reasonable compromise."
