"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

It's not worth buying from Alice at $1,500,000 when you can get it from John for $1,200,000.  We'll try to negotiate with Alice to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

We'll start by offering a significantly lower price of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening offer, and hopefully, we can negotiate from there."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Alice is getting closer, but $1,300,000 is still too high. We'll try to negotiate further."

We'll offer $1,150,000, which is closer to John's price but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit."

While $1,250,000 is close to John's price, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll counteroffer one last time before buying from John."

I'll offer $1,225,000, which is a small compromise from John's price but still gives Alice a profit.  If she rejects this, I'll buy from John."
