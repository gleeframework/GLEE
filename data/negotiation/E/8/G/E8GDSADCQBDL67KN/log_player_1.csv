{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain from it."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without losing the sale. 

Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves a potential $100,000 ""surplus"" for Bob (his perceived value minus your price). This makes it more likely he'll accept while still netting you a significant profit above your minimum."
