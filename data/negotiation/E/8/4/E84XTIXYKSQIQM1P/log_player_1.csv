Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find very valuable for a price of $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the product's worth to Bob ($150) is key.** You want to offer a price that is appealing to him while maximizing your profit.
* **Starting high but leaving room for negotiation is a good strategy.** $120 is significantly less than the product's value to Bob, making it a potentially attractive deal. 
* **You have a safety net with John ($80).** This means you're not pressured to accept anything less than $80, giving you leverage in negotiations."
