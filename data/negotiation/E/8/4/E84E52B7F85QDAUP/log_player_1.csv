Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise and it could really benefit your operations. I'm initially offering it at a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, starting closer to your minimum ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation and signals the product's value to you. 
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's specific value to Bob, making the high price seem more reasonable.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The language suggests a willingness to discuss the price, making Bob more likely to engage rather than immediately rejecting the offer.

By offering a high price and leaving room for negotiation, Alice increases her chances of securing a deal significantly higher than Bob's perceived value while still having the safety net of John's offer."
