"I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $12,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground and get this deal done.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $16,000, but I'm still a bit far off from that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $14,000, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  Since we're both trying to meet in the middle, how about we split the difference and go with $15,500?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both come to an agreement.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting close.  I'm willing to come down to $14,500 for the product.  This is a good compromise that allows us to both get what we want.  Let's not let this deal fall through.  What do you say?",14500.0,Alice,7,
