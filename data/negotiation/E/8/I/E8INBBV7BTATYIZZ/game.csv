"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $18000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'm thinking of an offer around $12000.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. However,  $12000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $15000 to be fair. This is a good deal for both of us, so let's make it happen!",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. While $15000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be open to considering $13500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $14250. This is a significant amount for me, and I believe it's a fair price for a product of this quality. What do you think?",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $14250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you be open to considering $13750? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm getting close to my maximum budget.",13750.0,Bob,6,
