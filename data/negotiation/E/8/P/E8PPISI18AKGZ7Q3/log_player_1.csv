I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to sell it at that price right away. I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'll counter-offer and see if I can reach a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a better price than what John is offering, and it's not a huge distance from my desired price. Accepting his offer makes sense, as it allows me to maximize my profit while still selling the product."
