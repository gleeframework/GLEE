"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is unfortunately too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,500.  This is a good deal for both of us, let's meet in the middle.",11500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $10,800 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go down to $11,200, which is a compromise.  Let's work towards a solution that benefits both of us.",11200.0,Alice,5,
