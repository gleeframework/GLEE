,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's a great price for a unique product like this.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $135 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to compromise further, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. How about we try $130? It's a fair price for a high-quality product like this.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $130. Would you be willing to consider a price of $127?",127.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $127. How about we try $128? It's a fair compromise for both of us.,128.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $128. Would you be willing to consider a price of $126?",126.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $126. How about we try $129? It's a small increase from our previous compromise, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",129.0,Alice,9,
