Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. This is a very valuable item, and I believe it would be a great asset to your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This is a starting point for the negotiation.  I'm opening with a high price, but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable.  It's important to gauge Bob's initial reaction to see if he's interested and how much room there is for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, I'm aiming for a higher price. I believe the product's value to me justifies holding out for a better offer.  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This reflects the unique value of this product and its potential for your business. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1250000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not ready to accept. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to get closer to $1,350,000.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is still a bit low for me.  To show my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price, considering the unique features of this product.  Let's finalize this deal and make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still not convinced that $1300000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1275000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  $1,275,000 is close to my minimum, but I believe I can get closer to $1,300,000.  There's still a chance Bob might be willing to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one. Let's settle on $1,287,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. I'm confident you won't regret this purchase."", ""product_price"": 1287500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1260000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,260,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,260,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, Bob's counteroffer of $1,260,000 is getting too close to my minimum.  While I could try to counteroffer one more time, I'm not confident I can get him to budge further.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a sale and a substantial amount, which is a safer option at this point."
