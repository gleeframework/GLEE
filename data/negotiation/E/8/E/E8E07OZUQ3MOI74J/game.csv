"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12,000 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to let it go that low. I'd be willing to come down to $13,000. That still gives you a good deal, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,500? That's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while.",12500.0,Bob,4,
