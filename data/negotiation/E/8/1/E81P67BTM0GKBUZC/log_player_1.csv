Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that as possible while still making a profit.

{""product_price"": $999,000}

This offer is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'm not willing to sell the product for $900,000, as that would leave me with a loss. I'll make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll make a counteroffer of $950,000 to Bob. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, and I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here is my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": $950,000}

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway and accept this offer, which is still a good deal for him considering the product's value to him."
