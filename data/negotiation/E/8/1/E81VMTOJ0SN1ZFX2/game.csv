"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer $750,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and leaves room for both of us to make a profit.  Let's see if we can make this work.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me, while also being more reasonable for you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This price reflects the product's value to me and provides a reasonable profit for both of us.  Let's close this deal at $800,000 and move forward.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $800,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $875,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me, while also being more reasonable for you.",875000.0,Alice,5,
