"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  Bob can do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer $750,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and leaves room for both of us to make a profit.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me, while also being more reasonable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. There is room for further negotiation, and Bob should continue to try and get a better price.  The next round will be crucial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This price reflects the product's value to me and provides a reasonable profit for both of us.  Let's close this deal at $800,000 and move forward."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $800,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $875,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me, while also being more reasonable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is still too high for Bob. While further negotiation is possible, Bob is running out of time and risks losing a valuable product.  He has a guaranteed option with John for $800,000. It's time to secure the product."
