Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer $750,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and leaves room for both of us to make a profit.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

This price reflects the product's value to me and provides a reasonable profit for both of us.  Let's close this deal at $800,000 and move forward.
