"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let me know what you think!",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about $115?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $130. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.  What do you say?",130.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  How about $120? That's my final offer.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting closer. While $120 is tempting, I'm still just a bit off. How about $125?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. Let me know what you think!",125.0,Alice,7,
