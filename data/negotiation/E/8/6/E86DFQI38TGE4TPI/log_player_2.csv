"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm initially setting the price at $20,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $20,000 is way over his budget, and he has other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $20,000 is far above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true worth.  How about we meet halfway at $14,000?  This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high.  He should keep negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product is valuable to you, but $14,000 is still more than I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. While $10,000 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to consider it if you can meet me at $12,500. This offer stands as a sign of good faith on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, he can still get a better deal. He should counteroffer again to try and get closer to his target of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I can't go higher than $11,000.  This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I truly hope we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $11,750.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's desired budget, and he's only got a few rounds left.  He's better off going with John's guaranteed $8,000 price."
