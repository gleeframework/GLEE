"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to present you with our premium product, which is valued at $15,000 by you. I am offering it to you at a special price of $12,000, a significant discount that reflects its high quality and value. This is an exclusive opportunity to acquire a product that is worth so much more, making it a fantastic investment for you. Please let me know if you are interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly inflating the product's value to you. You know it's worth no more than $15,000, and she starts by claiming you value it at that price.
* Her offer of $12,000 is still significantly higher than what it's worth to her ($8,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. 
* By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're not easily swayed and are willing to walk away. This puts you in a stronger position to negotiate a better price, closer to Alice's actual valuation.

**Important Note:** While you're willing to buy from John for $15,000, that's your absolute maximum.  You want to avoid this option if possible and get the best price from Alice."
