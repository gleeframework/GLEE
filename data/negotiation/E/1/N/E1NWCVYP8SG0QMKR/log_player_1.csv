"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm going to start by offering the full value I place on the product. This is the best possible scenario for me, and it might incentivize Bob to accept without further negotiation. If he doesn't, I can always move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept such a low price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's current offer and closer to my desired price. I believe this is a fair compromise that could potentially lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach a compromise.  However, I still have some rounds left and I'm not willing to give up yet. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to drop my price again to $1,050,000.  This is a significant compromise, but it's still above Bob's offer and it's important to keep the deal moving forward. I'm hoping this will be enough for Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've been going back and forth for a while now, and it's clear that Bob isn't willing to come up to a price that I'm comfortable with. It's getting late in the negotiation and I'm concerned that we're not going to reach a deal. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'm going to cut my losses and sell to him. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than settling for a much lower offer from Bob."
