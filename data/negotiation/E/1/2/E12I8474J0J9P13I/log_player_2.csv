"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way above his budget. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if a better price can be reached."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high.  He should continue negotiating and see if he can get Alice closer to his ideal price point."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's already stated his willingness to pay $12,000.  There's still some room to bargain, and he shouldn't rush into a deal that's still above his target price."
