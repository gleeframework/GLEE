"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point, aiming for a higher price than Bob's estimated value, but leaving room for negotiation.  It also includes a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. It's worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $16,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both some room to work with."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $14,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum value. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to make one final concession and come down to $15,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't regret."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure if you're serious about selling the product, but I'm willing to meet you at $14,500. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds left, Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, it's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing out entirely. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, so that's the best course of action at this point."
