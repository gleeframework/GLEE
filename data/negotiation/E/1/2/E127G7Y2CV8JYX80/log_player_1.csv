Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

This offer is strategic for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $95 is higher than your minimum of $80, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $100, so he's likely to consider this offer.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can still negotiate and potentially increase the price. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping the negotiation open and potentially getting closer to Bob's maximum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $70 is above your minimum of $80, it is significantly less than your initial offer of $95 and leaves less room for further negotiation. It's better to reject this offer and try to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $70 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $100 to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $70 was probably a bit low.  How about we meet in the middle at $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $78 is still below your initial goal of $95, it's above your minimum of $80 and only slightly lower than your last counteroffer of $85.  It's a reasonable compromise and secures a sale, which is important to avoid potentially losing the deal altogether."
