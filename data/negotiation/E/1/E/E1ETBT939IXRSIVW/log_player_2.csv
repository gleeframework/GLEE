"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find very valuable. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice since you can get the product for cheaper than John's price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $100.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

It's still worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price. Alice is willing to budge, so there's potential to get the product for less than $115."

{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $110? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
