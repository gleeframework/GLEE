Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $9,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm open to negotiation, $9,000 is too low for me.  I'm confident I can get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I understand $12,000 was a bit high.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower my price to $10,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This feels like a fair price that allows us both to come away satisfied.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250.  This is a significant reduction from my initial asking price and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement.  Let's close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
