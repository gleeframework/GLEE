Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000.  This is a one-time offer, as I have another interested buyer."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible while still making the offer appealing to Bob.
* **Bob's Value:** Since the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, there's room to negotiate above that price.
* **John as Leverage:**  Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of urgency and scarcity. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** $1,100,000 gives Bob a significant discount compared to John's offer while securing a substantial profit for Alice."
