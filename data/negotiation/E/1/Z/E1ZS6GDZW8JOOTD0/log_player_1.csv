"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. While I understand its worth to your business, my budget constraints mean I can't meet the $2,000,000 price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm hoping I can get closer to that with a counteroffer.  I still have time to negotiate with Bob, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. This is still above my ideal price point, but given the urgency of my needs and the value I see in the product, I believe this is a reasonable compromise. I hope we can move forward with this arrangement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
This is a great opportunity for me. Bob's offer of $1,500,000 meets my minimum acceptable price and is a good compromise. I don't want to risk losing this deal and potentially having to settle for less in the future."
