While I understand its worth to your business, my budget constraints mean I can't meet the $2,000,000 price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.

I hope we can move forward with this arrangement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
