,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you trying to maximize your earnings, but I'm looking to save some money.  $95 is a bit steep for me. How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. To find a middle ground, how about we consider a price of $90 for the product? This would still allow us to achieve a reasonable profit while being more accommodating to your budget.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $88.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",88.0,Bob,4,
