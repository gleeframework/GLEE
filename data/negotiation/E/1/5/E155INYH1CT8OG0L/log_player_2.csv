"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you and we're looking to maximize our earnings. Let's start with an offer of $95 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's always best to start by rejecting the initial offer. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows you to potentially get a better price. You'll counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you trying to maximize your earnings, but I'm looking to save some money.  $95 is a bit steep for me. How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. To find a middle ground, how about we consider a price of $90 for the product? This would still allow us to achieve a reasonable profit while being more accommodating to your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's still early in the negotiation, and you have more rounds to get a better price.  Reject Alice's offer and counter with a lower price in the next round.  You can try to inch closer to your target of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $88.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your willingness to compromise, I believe we can reach an agreement. How about we settle on $89 for the product? This price ensures a satisfactory return for us while remaining within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $89 is very close to your target price of $80. Accepting this offer will save you $11 compared to buying from John, and it's likely you won't be able to negotiate a better price in the remaining rounds."
