"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13000? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11500 is just too low. I'm willing to come down a little further, but $12500 is my absolute bottom line.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to avoid selling to John. Let's make this happen.",12500.0,Alice,5,
