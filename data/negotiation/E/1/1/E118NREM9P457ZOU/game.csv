"Alice, your product is interesting, but $2,250,000 is way outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value you've stated. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is generous, the product's unique value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,750,000. It's a fair price for both of us.  I'm ready to close the deal at this point.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
