"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $115. It's a great opportunity to get it at a slight discount compared to its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We're aiming for under $120 and Alice's starting offer is fairly close to John's price. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

We're starting with a counteroffer closer to Alice's value of the product ($100), but leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we set the price at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price I'd accept. There's still room to negotiate and get closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I'd like to find a price that works for both of us, Alice. How about $108?"",
""product_price"": 108
}
``` 

We're moving in smaller increments now, signaling that we're getting closer to our limit. This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your offer, Bob, I think we can agree on a price of $109 for the product. This still allows us to keep a reasonable margin while being fair to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This price is within our acceptable range and significantly lower than John's offer. It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal from Alice at this point."
