"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. This is a great deal for you, as it's well below the market value.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below market value, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your serious intent to purchase while staying within your budget.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $1,050,000 still leaves some room for Alice to counter, but it's a strong opening position.
* **Fairness:**  You've framed it as a ""fair price"" that benefits both parties. This is a good strategy to appeal to Alice's sense of reason."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1050000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1150000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,150,000 is still above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a good compromise that allows us to both make a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** You're increasing your offer but only by a smaller amount this time. This shows that you're serious about buying, but also that you have a firm budget in mind.
* **Compromise Language:**  Framing it as a ""good compromise"" appeals to Alice's sense of fairness and encourages her to meet you halfway.
* **Finality:** This counteroffer is close to your limit. If Alice rejects it, you're prepared to move on to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1100000 is still a bit below what I need. Let's meet in the middle at $1125000. This is a fair price that allows us both to close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,125,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your budget. You've already negotiated significantly and reached a point where further negotiation might be futile.  Since John offers the product for $1,000,000, it's a better decision to move forward with John to save the extra $125,000."
