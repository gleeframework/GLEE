It's not worth buying from Alice at $15,000.  Reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer of $8,000. This is a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject and make another counteroffer."

I'm going to raise my offer to $9,500. This is a reasonable compromise, and hopefully, Alice will be willing to meet me in the middle."

Alice's offer is still too high.  While I could continue negotiating, it's clear that Alice isn't going to budge much lower. It's better to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $10,000."
