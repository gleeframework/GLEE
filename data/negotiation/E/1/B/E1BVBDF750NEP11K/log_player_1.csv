Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum price but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is willing to pay this much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, hopefully showing him that I'm willing to negotiate while still ensuring a decent profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would like to get a higher price,  $125 is a decent price and it's more than I would get by selling to John. Further negotiation may not be worth it, as we are getting close to my minimum price."
