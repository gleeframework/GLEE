"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many satisfied customers. Given its quality and the benefits it offers, I believe it's worth more than $80 to you. Considering its true value, I am offering it to you for $95. This is a special opportunity to acquire a high-quality item at a price slightly above its worth to you, ensuring both parties benefit. Please let me know if you're interested in this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While Alice's message is persuasive, $95 is still more than your $80 limit and more expensive than John's offer. You can do better by rejecting this offer and going with John."
