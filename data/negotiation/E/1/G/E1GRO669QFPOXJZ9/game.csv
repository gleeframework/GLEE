"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $9,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can do better than $11,000, but I need to meet you in the middle. How about we meet at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. Let's try to make this work - how about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! $9,750 is a good step up, but I'm still not quite there. I can see the value of the product is worth more to me than that. How about we meet at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to go up slightly, how about $10,000 even? That's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,6,
