"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. My initial offer is $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a high profit. 
* **Leaving Room:** I don't want to start at Bob's maximum value immediately. There's a chance he's willing to pay even more, and this opening leaves space for that possibility.
* **Alternative in Mind:** I'm aware of John's offer ($1,000,000) as my safety net. This knowledge gives me confidence to aim high with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my initial ask and still leaves a substantial amount of potential profit on the table. While his message emphasizes budget constraints, I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more agreeable price. I'm not ready to settle for $1,200,000 yet, especially since I have John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position on the price, but $1,200,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Understanding:** Acknowledging Bob's perspective can help build rapport and keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Compromise, But Hold Firm:** I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate by meeting in the middle of the previous offers. This keeps me in a strong position while still moving towards a potential agreement. 
* **Highlight Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth to counter his focus on budget limitations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $1,250,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  While not my ideal price, $1,250,000 represents a $250,000 profit, which is significant. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently moved closer to my offers, indicating a genuine interest in buying. Accepting now avoids the risk of him withdrawing or stalling negotiations. 
* **Time Value:**  Each round represents time and potential opportunity costs. Closing the deal now secures the profit and allows me to move on to other ventures."
