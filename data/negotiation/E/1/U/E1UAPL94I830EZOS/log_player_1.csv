Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot, and I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts high, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product to pique Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 seems a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to earn more, Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Selling to John would give me the same amount, and further negotiation might lead to a lower price or a stalemate."
