Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value and your potential gains. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value but still leaves a substantial profit for me.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and straightforward, highlighting the potential benefits for Bob while maintaining my position. 

**Reasoning:**

* This initial offer allows for negotiation while leaving room for potential counteroffers.
*  A price of $1,000,000  is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's a starting point for negotiation. 
* This approach balances maximizing profit with the possibility of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum value.**  While I want to make a deal, accepting $600,000 would result in a huge loss.
* **I have a better option with John.**  I can sell the product to John for $1,200,000, which is much closer to my desired value.

**Reasoning:**

* I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, but I'm not going to settle for a price that drastically undervalues my product.
*  The risk of a long negotiation with Bob is not worth the potential loss. It's more prudent to secure the sale with John, who is willing to pay my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to negotiate further. How about $850,000?  This price still allows for a good profit for you, and it's closer to my desired value."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering with $850,000. This is still significantly lower than my minimum value, but it's a reasonable compromise, leaving a substantial profit for both of us.
* **Message:** The message is polite and focuses on finding a mutually beneficial solution. I highlight the potential profit for Bob and emphasize that my counteroffer is a step towards a deal.

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation:** I'm willing to negotiate with Bob but will not accept a price that significantly undervalues my product. 
* **Balancing Risk:** This counteroffer balances the risk of a long negotiation with Bob while maintaining a strong negotiation position. 
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** $850,000 is a compromise that is closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial offer. This can increase the likelihood of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** Even though he's moved closer, $725,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,200,000.
* **John offers a much better deal.** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is a factor.** The longer I negotiate with Bob, the more time I risk losing and potentially missing out on John's offer.
* **Minimizing Loss:** While I would prefer to sell for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss. 
* **Certainty:** Selling to John provides certainty and a higher profit compared to the ongoing risk of negotiations with Bob."
