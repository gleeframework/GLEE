"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to consider your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $11,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That way, I can still get a good deal on the product, and you can still make a profit.",10500.0,Bob,4,
