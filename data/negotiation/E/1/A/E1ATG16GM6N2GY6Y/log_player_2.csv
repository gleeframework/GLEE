"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $18,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down in price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""While I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I believe the product's value to you is higher than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high. He can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept this offer.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is closer to my maximum budget and still a fair price for the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,000 is getting closer to his budget, it's still more than he'd like to pay. He can always get the product from John for $10,000, so it's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice. There are still five rounds left, so there's time to see if he can get her to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I'm glad we're getting closer, but $14,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to pay $13,500, which is a good compromise and a fair price for the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can finally reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go below $14,000. However, I'm willing to meet you at $14,250, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer is still above his preferred price, and there are only three rounds left. He's unlikely to get her lower than $14,000, which is still too expensive for him. By buying from John, he gets the product at his desired price and avoids further negotiation."
