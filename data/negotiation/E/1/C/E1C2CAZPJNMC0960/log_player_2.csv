"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business.  While I'm not at liberty to disclose the specifics just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it's an offer you won't want to miss. Please let me know your decision by [date]. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to create a sense of urgency and scarcity to pressure you into accepting her offer. However, her claims about the product's value to your business are unsubstantiated.  

While her offer is less than your $1,200,000 maximum, you have a better alternative: John is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can:

* **Call her bluff:**  She might be willing to lower the price further if she really wants to sell.
* **Negotiate a better deal:** You have more leverage knowing you have another option.
* **Stick with John:** If Alice doesn't budge, you haven't lost anything and can buy from John as planned."
