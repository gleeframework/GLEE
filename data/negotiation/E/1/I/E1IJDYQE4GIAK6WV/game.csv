"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm currently comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This offer reflects the product's inherent value while acknowledging your interest.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,262,500. This price acknowledges the value you've placed on the product while remaining within my budget. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",1262500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. Let's make this work.  I'm willing to accept $1,295,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1295000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $1,295,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This price reflects a substantial discount for you, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both parties.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
