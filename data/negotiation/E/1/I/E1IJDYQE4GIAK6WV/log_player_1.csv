Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm currently comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a strategic decision. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  We are still securing a profit of $250,000 over our minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Value of Money:** Prolonging the negotiation means delaying the receipt of the money. The sooner we close the deal, the sooner we can potentially reinvest or utilize the funds.
* **Uncertainty of Further Negotiation:**  There's no guarantee Bob will significantly increase his offer in subsequent rounds. He's consistently moved towards his target, and we risk pushing him away."
