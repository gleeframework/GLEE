"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $16,000. I think it's a fair price considering what you're getting."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
At this point, Bob is offering our minimum acceptable price.  There's no guarantee we can negotiate him higher in the remaining rounds. Accepting ensures we get the best possible outcome right now.
