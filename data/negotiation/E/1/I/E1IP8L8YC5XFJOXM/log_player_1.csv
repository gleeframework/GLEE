{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $175. It's a steal considering its value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and keeps Bob engaged. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter-offer, or switch to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's significantly below my minimum selling price of $150 and also below his perceived value of $100. I will counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to drop the price to $140.  How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my preferred range.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my target price.  I will counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to go down to $135. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would save you from having to look elsewhere. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'd like to make one more push. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum selling price of $150. Although I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum. Since John is willing to pay $150, I'll sell to him instead."
