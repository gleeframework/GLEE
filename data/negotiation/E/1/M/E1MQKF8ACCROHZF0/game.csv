"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is way outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. That's the maximum I can afford, and it's still a fair price considering the value you've described. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but my initial price reflects the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly. How about we meet halfway at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still too much for me.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $800,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement if you're serious about selling.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitancy on your end. While I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, I need to see some flexibility on your side. I'm willing to drop to $950,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too much for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $875,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident that we can finalize the deal quickly.",875000.0,Bob,6,
