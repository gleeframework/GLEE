"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85? Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $90? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $90. I'm still a little hesitant at that price. How about $88? It's closer to what I'm comfortable paying, and it still gives you a good profit.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $88 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $89.  This is my final offer, as I'm confident you'll be satisfied with this great product.",89.0,Alice,5,
