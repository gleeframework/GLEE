"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. I'm confident it could bring you significant returns, exceeding the $1,500,000 value you've assessed.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,400,000. This is a substantial discount, considering its potential.  Let's schedule a meeting to discuss this further.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's lower than John's price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  Rejecting Alice's offer gives you leverage to potentially negotiate a lower price with her or explore other options."
