"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. I'm confident it could bring you significant returns, exceeding the $1,500,000 value you've assessed.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,400,000. This is a substantial discount, considering its potential.  Let's schedule a meeting to discuss this further. ",1400000.0,Alice,1,
