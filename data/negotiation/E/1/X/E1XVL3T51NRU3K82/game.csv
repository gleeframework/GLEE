"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,250?  It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",12250.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,750 still doesn't quite work for me.  Let's compromise at $12,000.  This way, we both get a fair deal.  What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit impatient, but I'm still interested in the product. How about we meet at $11,500? I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I don't think I can go any lower than that.",11500.0,Bob,6,
