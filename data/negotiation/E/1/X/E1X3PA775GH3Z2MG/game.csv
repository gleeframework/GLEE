"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? How about $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. How about we split the difference and go with $160?  It's a fair price that allows me to make a profit while also giving you a great value.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I understand your position, but I still believe there's room for compromise. Could we aim for $140? This would allow us to meet in the middle.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm happy to keep negotiating. $140 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $145?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the deal.",145.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. Let's aim for $142.50. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",142.5,Bob,6,
