Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $1,300,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit margin for you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise that considers both our positions. This price reflects the potential value of the product while leaving room for you to make a solid profit. Let's try to reach an agreement at this price.
