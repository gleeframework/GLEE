"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to consider the product at $850,000. This would allow both of us to have a successful deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to make a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product, which is a significant step closer to your position.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
