Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell at $850,000, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $1,000,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $850,000 is still below my minimum value for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value I'm placing on it, and I believe it's still a fair price for you, given its worth to you. Let's continue working together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant jump from my previous offer. Would you be open to meeting in the middle at $900,000? I believe this represents a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
