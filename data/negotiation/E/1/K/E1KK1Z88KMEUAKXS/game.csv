"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this price reflects its value and is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. However, $850,000 is still below my minimum value for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value I'm placing on it, and I believe it's still a fair price for you, given its worth to you. Let's continue working together to find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant jump from my previous offer. Would you be open to meeting in the middle at $900,000? I believe this represents a fair compromise for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
