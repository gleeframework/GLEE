"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $800000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with this price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1100000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me is $800000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $900000 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $950000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1000000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $920000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",920000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $920000. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $930000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement here.",930000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice. However, $930000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $910000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm starting to think that buying it from John might be a better option if we can't come to an agreement here. What do you think?",910000.0,Bob,6,
