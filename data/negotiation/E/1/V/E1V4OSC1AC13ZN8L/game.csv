,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your interest in the product, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is my best price for now.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  I'm still pretty set on $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $9,500 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",9500.0,Alice,5,
