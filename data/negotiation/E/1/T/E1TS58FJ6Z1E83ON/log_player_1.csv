I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a good starting point, as it's a reasonable price for both of us. It's higher than my minimum price of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

I'm accepting Bob's offer for $110. While I would prefer to earn more, it's a good price and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. It's also better than selling to John for $80."
