"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $12000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $9000 is below my minimum price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. I'm now offering the product to you for $11000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the value you'll get from the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your new offer, so I'm offering $9500 for the product. Can we make a deal?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, but $9500 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm now offering the product to you for $11500. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I've made several concessions, and I'm starting to think we're not on the same page. I'm willing to meet you at the lowest price I'm willing to pay, which is $9000. Please let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,6,
