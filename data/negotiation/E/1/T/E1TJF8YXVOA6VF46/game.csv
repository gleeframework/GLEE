"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to reach an agreement. I'm willing to come down to $9,250, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider selling to John. I'm confident he'll be happy to pay my asking price.",9250.0,Alice,5,
