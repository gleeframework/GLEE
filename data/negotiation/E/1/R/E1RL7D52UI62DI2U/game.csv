"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1200000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1250000. This price gives you a slight advantage while allowing me to earn a bit more than my minimum.  Let me know if you're interested in this opportunity.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
