"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1200000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1250000. This price gives you a slight advantage while allowing me to earn a bit more than my minimum.  Let me know if you're interested in this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than the value you're willing to pay. You can get the same product from John for $1,200,000, which is within your budget. Rejecting Alice's offer saves you $50,000."
