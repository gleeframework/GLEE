,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,200,000 is lower than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,450,000. This is a fair price that considers both our positions.  What do you say?",1450000.0,Alice,5,
