"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that with a strong initial offer, I can secure a good price while also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to make a deal, I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,200,000 is lower than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 
 
This counteroffer is my absolute minimum. It's still above Bob's initial offer, but it allows for a possible compromise. If he rejects this, I might consider selling to John, as his offer is my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,500,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, even though it's closer to my desired outcome. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll need to see a higher offer from him. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe we can still reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,450,000. This is a fair price that considers both our positions.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

I'm coming down slightly again, but I'm firm on this price. It's a good compromise that allows both of us to walk away feeling like we got a good deal. If he rejects this, I'll be ready to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit below my target. Would you be willing to consider $1,425,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to take a couple more rounds to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but if he rejects it, I'll be ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $1,425,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,440,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's the last offer I'm willing to make.  If you're serious about buying the product, let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1440000}
``` 

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding firm at a price that's above my minimum. I'm trying to create some urgency by letting him know this is my final offer. If he doesn't accept, I'm ready to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a critical point in the negotiation. Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're running out of rounds. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed profit with John. While I would have preferred a higher price, it's better to have a sure thing than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with nothing."
