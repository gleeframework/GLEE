"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I'm confident it will be a great asset for you.  My initial offer is $1,150,000.  This reflects its significant value and allows for a comfortable margin for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While I value a mutually beneficial agreement, $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,112,500. This still allows for a good margin for both of us.  What do you think?",1112500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,112,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $1,100,000. Would you consider $1,090,000?",1090000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate further.  However, $1,090,000 is still below my minimum.  How about we meet at $1,100,000? This is a fair compromise, and we can close the deal.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
