Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find very valuable.  I'm asking for $14,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While I start high, the message's tone is open to discussion.  Bob might try to negotiate down, and I have some wiggle room before hitting my minimum price.
* **Highlight Value:**  By mentioning that the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, I'm reinforcing the value proposition and justifying the high price. 
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $12,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation. I don't mention John directly, but the confidence from having a backup is implicit."
