Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider this offer?

It's too early to sell to John. I can likely get closer to my minimum price with a few more rounds of negotiation with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,750 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'm within striking distance of my goal with John, so I'm willing to risk it and keep negotiating with Bob for one more round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're firm on your offer, but $8,900 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,100. This is my final offer.  If we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options. "", ""product_price"": 9100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get as much as you can, but I'm really close to walking away. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,900 and $9,100, which is $9,000. This is my final offer. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,000 isn't my ideal price, I'm close to running out of time and risk losing out on John's offer.  Accepting Bob's final offer is the best course of action at this point."
