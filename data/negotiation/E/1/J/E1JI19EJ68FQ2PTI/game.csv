"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $950000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value and my minimum acceptable price. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts in negotiating, Alice. However, I am unable to agree to the price of $950000. Considering my budget and the current market value, I am proposing a final offer of $930000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",930000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $930000. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to give up any more. I'm willing to sell the product to John for $1000000, and I think that's a fair price considering its value. I'm giving you one last chance to meet me at $975000. If not, I'll have to consider selling it to John. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,7,
