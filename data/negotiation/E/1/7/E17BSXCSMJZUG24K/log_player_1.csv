{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I believe it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a good starting point. I'm offering a price higher than my minimum but leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and emphasizing the potential value to Bob.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $10000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8500.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, I still believe the product has value for Bob, and I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  Let's see if I can counter with a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you're looking for a good deal. While I'm willing to come down a bit,  $8,500 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 9250}
