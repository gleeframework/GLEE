"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I believe it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good deal, there's always room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore if Alice is willing to come down further in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you're looking for a good deal. While I'm willing to come down a bit,  $8500 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9250? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, and $9,250 is still a good deal for you, saving you $2,750 compared to buying from John. While you might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject your next offer and you'd be stuck with John's higher price.  Accepting this offer secures a good price and avoids further negotiation risk."
