"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This gives me room to negotiate down while gauging Bob's interest level. 
* **Anchoring:** A high initial offer can anchor the negotiation in my favor. Even if unrealistic, it sets a reference point that can influence Bob's counteroffers.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message emphasizes openness to discussion, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate but also confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000. I'm confident that we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I still believe there's potential to negotiate a higher price. His willingness to ""meet halfway"" after only one round suggests he might be willing to go higher. I'll counter with a price closer to his perceived value but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,500,000.  It demonstrates your understanding of this product's potential. To be fair, I need to be closer to $1,900,000 for a deal to make sense on my end. Would you be willing to consider something in that range?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Appreciate:**  Recognizing Bob's offer and using positive language helps maintain a good negotiating environment. 
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm coming down significantly from my initial offer but staying well above Bob's offer and my minimum.  
* **Justification:** By vaguely mentioning  ""making sense on my end,"" I offer a reason for my counter without revealing my hand or becoming overly aggressive.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Phrasing my counteroffer as a question encourages Bob to respond and keeps the negotiation active."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,800,000, which is my absolute maximum. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase from his previous offer and represents a substantial profit margin for me.
* **""Absolute Maximum"" Signal:**  By stating this is his maximum, Bob signals he's unlikely to go much higher. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of losing Bob without a guarantee of a better offer. Accepting now secures a very good deal. 

While I could potentially push for a bit more, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential reward at this point."
