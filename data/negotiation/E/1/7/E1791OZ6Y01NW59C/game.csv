"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. How about we settle on $750,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $750,000 is closer, it's still a bit steep for me. How about $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
