"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the opportunity, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a budget of $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $95?",95.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraint, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $100 is a fair price, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer you the product for $105. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",105.0,Alice,5,
