"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening position that aims to gauge Bob's potential interest and willingness to pay a premium.  If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to adjust my offer in subsequent rounds based on his counteroffer and my desire to maximize profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's a significant improvement from his initial rejection, it's still below my desired price point. I believe there's room for negotiation and I want to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm countering with $950,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages him to close the deal while still securing a good price for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still squeeze out a bit more. There are still several rounds left, and I'm not yet at the point where I'm comfortable settling for a price that's only $20,000 above John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}
```

I'm countering again with $940,000.  This is a smaller increment than before, showing that I'm getting closer to a compromise.  I'm hoping this small adjustment will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit lower than my ideal price, the negotiations have gone on for a while.  With only 4 rounds left, the risk of Bob walking away and me having to sell to John for a lower price is increasing.  $930,000 is a good profit, and it's time to secure the deal."
