"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find an agreeable figure through negotiation.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay up to $1,500,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your position.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the value I believe this product holds, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,750,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to land at $1,600,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to acquire the product within my budget.  Let me know if you're open to that.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
