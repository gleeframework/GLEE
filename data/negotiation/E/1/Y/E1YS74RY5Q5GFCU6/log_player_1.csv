Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John, it's worth trying to sell to Bob for more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested, potentially reaching a price higher than $120.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but the message frames it as a ""special deal"" to entice him.  

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still securing a guaranteed sale to John if needed."
