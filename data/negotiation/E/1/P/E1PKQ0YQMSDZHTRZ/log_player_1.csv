"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $15,000 to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if he counteroffers, while still ensuring I earn more than my minimum value of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is above my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $15,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but still allow me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $14,000,  $13,500 is a good deal and it's getting late in the negotiation.  There's a risk that if I reject and counteroffer, Bob will walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $12,000."
