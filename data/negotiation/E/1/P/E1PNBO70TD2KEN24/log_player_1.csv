Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage.
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves you room to negotiate and still secure a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** It directly addresses the price and invites Bob to respond.

If Bob rejects this offer, you can analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a counter-counteroffer, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin. You have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay your minimum price.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Counter with a higher price:**  You can aim for a price closer to $1,100,000 or even a bit higher.
* **Gauge Bob's seriousness:**  If Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to increase his offer further.

By keeping the negotiation open, you have the potential to secure a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counter:** This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise, splitting the difference between your previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Focus on Value:** The message emphasizes the value of the product to help Bob understand why the price is justified.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message suggests a willingness to negotiate further, keeping the door open for a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,000,000.  I'm willing to pay $1,025,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows for some profit for you. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate, his latest offer is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price.  You have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $1,200,000, which is well above your minimum and a much better deal than Bob's current offer. It's time to cut your losses and secure the higher price with John."
