Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is still a decent price, I'm aiming for a bit higher. I believe I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8,200. If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $8,200 is a good price, and I'm getting closer to my desired target. There's a chance I could get a bit more by continuing to negotiate, but there's also a risk that Bob will walk away or I'll end up selling to John for a lower price. It's better to secure a good deal now."
