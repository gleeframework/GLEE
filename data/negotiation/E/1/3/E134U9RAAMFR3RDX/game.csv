"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I've done my research and I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is appreciated, but it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay up to $850,000.  This reflects the value I see in it and my budget. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product.  It's a fair compromise considering the value we both see in it.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value I'm getting from the sale.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
