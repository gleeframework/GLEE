"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to acquire a truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value, justifying the high price without revealing my own minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and invites Bob's response and potential counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,500,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is good, it's still significantly below his perceived value of the product. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the remaining rounds. Selling to John for $800,000 is a last resort and not yet necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, the value this product brings warrants a price closer to my initial proposal.  Would you consider $1,275,000?"",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my price, but only by a small amount ($25,000). This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Focus on Value:** The message reiterates the product's inherent value, subtly reminding Bob of its worth to him.
* **Open for Discussion:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a question, encouraging continued dialogue and potentially a counter from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am still aiming to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 represents a $450,000 profit, which is a significant return. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I might be able to push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the risk of Bob walking away increases. Accepting now secures a very favorable outcome.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now also saves time and potential negotiation fatigue."
