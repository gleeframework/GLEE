This seems like a good time to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You've managed to negotiate the price down to $930,000, a saving of $270,000 from Alice's initial offer and $270,000 less than John's price. 
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has stated this is her final offer. Pushing further might lead to an impasse, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Time Investment:** You've already spent five rounds negotiating. Accepting now secures the deal and avoids potentially wasting more time if the negotiation stalls."
