"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $9,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about $8,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $8,800 is not ideal for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $9,200? This gives us both a decent deal, and we can avoid further back and forth.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $9,200 is the best price for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,6,
