You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to pay no more than $12,000.  Alice's offer is too high.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to his maximum of $12,000. Starting with a counteroffer of $12,500 is a reasonable first step, leaving room for negotiation while showing Bob's seriousness."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's target of $12,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate.  There's still room for Alice to come down in price and for Bob to get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price.  A counteroffer of $13,000 shows that he is willing to compromise while still leaving room for Alice to negotiate if she needs to.  This keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above Bob's ideal price of $12,000, but it's getting closer.  Considering that Bob has limited rounds and a safe alternative with John, accepting this offer makes sense.  It's a reasonable compromise and saves Bob from potentially getting stuck with a worse price later."
