Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $11,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my asking price.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
