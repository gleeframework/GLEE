"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $11,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my asking price.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
