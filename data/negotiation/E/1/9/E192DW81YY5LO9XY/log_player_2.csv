"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction.  By offering $950,000, he's demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still keeping a substantial margin for himself. This offer is considerably lower than Alice's initial offer, but still potentially profitable for Alice as she values the product at $1,200,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is only $50,000 more than what Bob could buy the product for from John.  While there's still room for negotiation, the potential savings are minimal at this point. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product for Bob, and he only pays a small premium compared to John's price.  Further negotiation might not be worth the time and effort."
