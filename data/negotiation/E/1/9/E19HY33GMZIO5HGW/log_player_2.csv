"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $120. Alice's offer is $115. While it's a good deal, you can still get it for less from John, who is selling it for $120. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John saves you $5."
