Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $115 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate, while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:**  Offering a price too close to $120 might discourage Bob, leading him to reject the offer and forcing you to sell to John for $100."
