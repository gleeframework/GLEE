,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  How about $130? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $137.50. I think this is a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you.",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $137.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $135.  I'm sure we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $138. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal!",138.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still holding out for $135. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $138, Bob. I've already made concessions, and I think that's the lowest price I can offer. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to discuss further, but I need to be fair to myself as well.",138.0,Alice,7,
