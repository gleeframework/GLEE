"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. While I can't disclose the specifics just yet, I can assure you this product is worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a chance to secure a significant investment with a high potential return. If you're interested, please let me know and we can discuss further details. If not, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $1,500,000, which is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While she claims the product is worth $1,000,000 to her, that doesn't guarantee it's worth that much to you. It's better to reject her offer and buy from John for $1,200,000, staying within your budget."
