"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This price is still fair considering the product's value and the market.  What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,800. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market. Can you consider this offer?",11800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11,800 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,200. This is a reasonable compromise, and it's the final offer I'm willing to make. If you're serious about buying, let's close this deal.",12200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one more counteroffer of $11,900. I think this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Can you consider this offer?",11900.0,Bob,6,
