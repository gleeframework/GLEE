"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, giving me room to negotiate if necessary.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $100 to Bob, and this price allows for some potential profit.  We'll see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum, I'm not going to settle for that price right away. I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob, and I still have 8 rounds to work with. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still a good profit for me. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, we're nearing the middle ground and I want to avoid the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price. I'm happy with $110 and I'm not interested in delaying the sale."
