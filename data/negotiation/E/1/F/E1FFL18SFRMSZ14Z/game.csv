"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $15,000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, considering its value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you and my minimum price of $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10,500?  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to me and your minimum price.  I'm hopeful we can close the deal here.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me and my minimum price of $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11250.0,Alice,5,
