"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $15,000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's a good starting point, it's still significantly above what the product is worth to Alice ($8,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **Buying from John is a safety net.**  Having the option to buy from John for $15,000 provides a ceiling for the negotiation, ensuring you don't overpay.
* **Rejecting allows for a counteroffer.**  By rejecting, you can start the negotiation process and try to lower the price further."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:** This counteroffer represents a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about negotiating. However, it's not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected.
* **Focus on value and mutual benefit:**  The message highlights the value to you and the potential for a good deal for both parties, making it more appealing than just a lowball offer.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message ends by asking for Alice's opinion, leaving room for further negotiation in the next round."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you and my minimum price of $8,000.

* **Buying from John is still an option.** This provides a safety net in case the negotiation falls through.
