{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I could get from other buyers.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Bob's interest:** I'm highlighting that it's a good deal for him and that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This price allows for several rounds of negotiation before I need to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my goal. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** There is still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Selling to John is a last resort:** Selling to John for $15,000 is a secure option, but I want to exhaust the negotiation with Bob first to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $10,500?  That's still a fair price for both of us, and gives you a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $12,000 to $10,500, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying above minimum:** $10,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring I don't sell for less than I'm comfortable with.
* **Appealing to Bob's interest:**  I'm highlighting that it's still a ""fair price"" for him and that it gives him a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking $9800 is a more reasonable price for me. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There is a risk that further negotiation will result in a lower price, and I might end up having to sell to John for $15,000 anyway.
* **Time factor:**  Negotiation takes time and effort, and accepting Bob's offer allows me to finalize the sale quickly.

In this situation, the potential gain from further negotiation is minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal entirely or having to sell to John for the same price.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most prudent decision."
