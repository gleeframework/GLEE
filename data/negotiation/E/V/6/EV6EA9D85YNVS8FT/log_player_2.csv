"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $120.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate it, $140 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $125 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135. That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly, but it's still above my maximum budget of $120.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk is that she'll either reject my next counteroffer or hold firm at $135.  Buying from John guarantees me the product at my desired price, so it's the most sensible option."
