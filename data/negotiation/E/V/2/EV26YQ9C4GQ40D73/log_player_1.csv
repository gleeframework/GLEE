Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $19,000.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have other potential buyers."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim for a higher price with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down if he's interested but finds the initial price too high. 
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other buyers can encourage Bob to act quickly if he's genuinely interested.

**Important:** It's unlikely Bob will accept a price above $10,000 knowing it's only worth that much to him. However, this strategy maximizes your potential gain before resorting to your guaranteed sale."
