"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while also ensuring I make a profit beyond my minimum value of $10,000.  I'll assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is a decent price, I'm aiming for a higher profit. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a lower price in the next round, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering $13,500, a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still holding out for a higher price than Bob's initial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer more,  I'm not confident I can get a significantly better offer in the remaining rounds, especially with John always as a backup option at $10,000. It's better to secure a profit now than risk losing out entirely."
