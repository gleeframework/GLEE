"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's very competitive.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's opening message is vague and doesn't give any concrete information about the product's value to you. 
* Her offer of $9,500 is only slightly below your maximum price and significantly above her own valuation.
* By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or move on to John. While John's price is your maximum, there's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price to avoid losing the sale."
