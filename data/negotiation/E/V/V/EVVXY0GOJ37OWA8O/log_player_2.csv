"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You are aiming for a price closer to your $8,000 limit, and this offer is too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still potentially within her range, considering her value of $12,000. It also leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. While it is closer to your target price, it's worth trying to push for a lower price. You have several rounds left, so you can afford to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
``` 

You're inching closer to your target price. This counteroffer is a compromise, offering Alice a price higher than your initial offer but still significantly lower than hers. It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while maintaining your goal of getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's closer to her value than yours, and you're running out of rounds.  However, there's still room to negotiate a better price, and it's worth trying to push for a lower offer.  You're still closer to your goal with Alice than with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

This counteroffer is a significant jump from your previous offer but still represents a substantial saving compared to Alice's latest price. It's a calculated risk - if Alice accepts, you'll be closer to your target price.  If she rejects, you'll have to decide if it's worth continuing to negotiate or moving to John's offer.  You're getting close to the end of the rounds, so you need to start considering the potential loss if you continue to bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

With only three rounds remaining, the risk of not getting a good deal with Alice is too high.  Alice's offer is still above your target price and not close enough to justify further negotiation.  You've reached a point where it's more beneficial to go with the guaranteed price from John and avoid the potential for a breakdown in negotiations.  You can always try again with Alice another time, but at this point, you're better off locking in a deal."
