{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum value:** This gives you some wiggle room to lower the price if necessary.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows you're confident in the product's value. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to give him the product for a price that low.  I'll try to meet him halfway with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:**  It demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Stay above your minimum:**  It keeps the price above my $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:**  It allows for potential future adjustments if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the price I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $875,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to give in to his pressure just yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $875,000 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $887,500.  This is a final offer. If you're serious about buying the product, let's close this deal. Otherwise, I'll move on to other buyers."", ""product_price"": 887500}
```

This offer is a calculated move:

* **Finality:**  It establishes a sense of urgency and a clear deadline for Bob. 
* **Small Compromise:**  It shows a continued willingness to compromise but keeps the price above my minimum.
* **Pressure Point:**  It pushes Bob to make a decision, potentially leading to an acceptance or a counteroffer close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that this is a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable paying $887,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $882,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the price I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $882,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $882,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $882,500 is very close to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,000,000.  I've already made multiple concessions and feel like we're at an impasse.  Rather than continuing to haggle with Bob and potentially lowering my price further, it's more beneficial to accept John's offer and secure the full $1,000,000."
