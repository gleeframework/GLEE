"I appreciate your response, Alice. After careful consideration, I am still unable to commit to a price higher than $1,100,000. I am hopeful we can reach an agreement closer to that figure. Here is my latest counteroffer: $1,075,000.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're close. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,150,000.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1,125,000. This allows both of us to move forward with a deal that feels fair.  I'm confident this price is beneficial for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
