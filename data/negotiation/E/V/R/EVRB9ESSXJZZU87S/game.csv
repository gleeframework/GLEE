"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a serious offer to you today. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to make some concessions, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we compromise at $850,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be open to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to listen. However, $750,000 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $825,000? This is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, this is getting close to what I had in mind.  How about $780,000? That's a fair offer considering the value and our respective positions.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close. However, $780,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. How about we meet at $825,000? This is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,7,
