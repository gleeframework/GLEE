"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $100 for it."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still lower than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a better price.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and positive message sets a good tone for the negotiation. 
* **Direct Offer:** I'm making a clear offer to avoid any ambiguity.

**Strategy:**

* I'm hoping Bob will accept my initial offer. If not, I'll be prepared to negotiate further in the next rounds.
* I'll keep the option to sell to John at $80 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm not sure I can go that high right now.  How about $90?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reasonable Counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer is a fair price considering my initial offer and the product's value to him.
* **Potential for Higher Offers:** Accepting his offer ensures a sale. I can still try to get a higher price if we continue the negotiation. 
* **Time Factor:**  Accepting the offer secures a sale early in the negotiation process, leaving less room for the deal to fall apart.

**Strategy:**

*  I'm willing to accept this offer for now. This will allow me to secure a sale and keep the negotiation open for potential future rounds. 
* I'm not in a rush to sell to John, as I still believe I can get a better price from Bob."
