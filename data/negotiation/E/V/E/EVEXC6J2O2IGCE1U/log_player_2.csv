"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $90 is better than $120, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($80). This suggests there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Offer close to Alice's value:** This counteroffer is just above the product's worth to Alice ($80), showing Bob's willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Reasonable Justification:** The message explains the reason for the counteroffer, making it less of a blunt rejection and more of a negotiation. 
* **Keeps the deal alive:** By making a counteroffer, Bob keeps the negotiation going without resorting to buying from John immediately."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product's value is worth a bit more than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While Alice is willing to meet ""halfway"", the offer of $95 is still above Bob's desired price range of $120.
* **Negotiation potential:** Alice has shown willingness to negotiate. This suggests there's still room for a compromise.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to push for a lower price. 
* **Risk of escalation:** Accepting the offer risks ending up with a price closer to John's $120, which is not ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Alice, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer $90. This is a fair price that takes into account the product's value and my budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's last offer ($95) and Bob's previous offer ($85), showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Justification:** The message highlights the value of the product and Bob's budget limitations, making the counteroffer seem reasonable.
* **Keeps the negotiation moving:** This counteroffer continues the dialogue and avoids a premature jump to John's offer."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm thinking more along the lines of $97.50. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $97.50 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $120. 
* **Negotiation continues:** Alice's willingness to compromise shows there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer keeps the process open for a better deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $92.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $94.75.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $94.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $94.75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $93.75. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'll meet you at $95. This is still a good deal for me, considering the product's value, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** This is the 9th round of negotiation, leaving only one round remaining.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has repeatedly rejected offers closer to Bob's budget, demonstrating that she might be unwilling to compromise further.
* **Price Point:**  The price offered by Alice ($95) is still outside Bob's budget range. 
* **Risk of Escalation:**  Accepting the offer at this point, with limited time remaining, could potentially lead to Alice asking for an even higher price in the final round.
* **Secure Option:**  Purchasing from John at $120, while not ideal, provides a guaranteed transaction within Bob's budget, avoiding the risk of a higher price or a failed deal with Alice."
