"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in the product but my budget is capped at $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? ",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget limitations. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is my final offer.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,450,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  However, I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value of the product and my financial constraints.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
