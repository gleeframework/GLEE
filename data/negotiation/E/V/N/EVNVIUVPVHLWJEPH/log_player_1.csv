Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $600,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. Given the product's value, I'm willing to offer $750,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.
