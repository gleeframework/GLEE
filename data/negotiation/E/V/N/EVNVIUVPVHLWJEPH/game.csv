"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly special. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $600,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $600,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. Given the product's value, I'm willing to offer $750,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $750,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $725,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth.",725000.0,Alice,3,
