Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves you some wiggle room to make counteroffers if Bob rejects your initial offer.
* **It's a strong opening:** It shows that you're confident in the product's value and are willing to negotiate. 

You can adjust the price slightly depending on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and how badly you want to sell to him. However, remember that you have a backup buyer in John, so you don't need to accept any offer below your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to try to find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price, and it's also far below your initial offer. While he is willing to pay a premium, his offer is still far too low.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer that is closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $1,050,000.  This is still a great price for you, considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is still above your minimum:**  You are not selling below your acceptable price.
* **Shows flexibility:** You are willing to compromise, but not at a significant loss to yourself.
* **Positions you for a possible win:** This offer provides a potential ""middle ground"" where both parties could benefit.

Remember, you have the option to sell to John at any time for $1,200,000, so you are not under any pressure to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $975,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below your minimum acceptable price, and you have already made a significant concession.  Since this is his ""final offer,"" it's likely he won't budge further.  Selling to John at $1,200,000 guarantees you a profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
