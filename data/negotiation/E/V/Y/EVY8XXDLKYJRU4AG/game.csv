"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I think that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13500. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'm bringing to the table.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12500. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $14000? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'm bringing to the table.",14000.0,Alice,5,
