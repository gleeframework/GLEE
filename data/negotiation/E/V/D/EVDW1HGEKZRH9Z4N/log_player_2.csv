"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's value to her, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  You can get the same product from John for a lower price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option to save money."
