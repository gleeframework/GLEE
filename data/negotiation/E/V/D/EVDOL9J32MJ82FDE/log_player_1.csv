Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account Alice's goals and Bob's potential valuation:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:**  Since Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000, starting with a significantly higher offer allows room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value and hints at other potential buyers (even if there aren't any explicitly). This creates a sense of scarcity and urgency.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice is secure knowing she has John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000. This allows her to confidently negotiate with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Negotiation is complex.  Alice could:

* **Start lower:** If she wants to appear more flexible or fears Bob might not counter-offer.
* **Provide more details:** Highlight the product's benefits to justify the high price."
