Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value is undeniable, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially offering it to you for $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his perceived value. You have room to negotiate and should aim for a price closer to his valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $900,000 undervalues the true worth of this product and the benefits it offers.  I'm willing to move down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Hold Firm:**  While we want to be flexible, dropping to $900,000 is too steep a concession. By holding firmer at $1,100,000, we signal the value of the product and our own bottom line.
* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to be more serious with his next counter-offer. 
* **Justification:** We've slightly softened our stance with ""willing to move down"" but remain firm by highlighting the value Bob would receive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that the product is valuable, but I need to stick within my budget. Would you consider $975,000? This is a fair offer that reflects my serious interest. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Value:** Bob's offer is moving closer to our minimum, but it's still significantly below his own perceived value of the product.
* **Negotiating Room:** We're only on Round 4 of 10. There's plenty of room to negotiate further and try to close the gap. 
* **John as Backup:**  We always have the safety net of John's offer. This allows us to be a bit bolder in our negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To show I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to accept a price of $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to see this product in your capable hands. "",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Show Flexibility:** We're making a substantial move down to $1,050,000 to demonstrate our willingness to negotiate and reach a mutually acceptable agreement.
* **Highlight Compromise:** By emphasizing our ""significant compromise,"" we subtly remind Bob that he also needs to be willing to move from his position.
* **Positive Language:**  We're maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation atmosphere conducive to a deal.
* **Urgency (Implied):**  While not explicitly stating a deadline, moving down this much implies we're getting closer to a point where we might accept John's offer if Bob doesn't counter reasonably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're clearly motivated to sell and I appreciate the movement you've shown. To be honest, $1,000,000 is the absolute top of my budget. If you can meet me there, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Our Minimum:** Bob's offer now matches our absolute minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Strong Signal:**  His language (""absolute top of my budget,"" ""ready to close the deal today"") indicates he's unlikely to go higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we *might* be able to squeeze out a bit more in further rounds, the risk of him walking away isn't worth the potential reward at this point. We have a sure $1,000,000 on the table."
