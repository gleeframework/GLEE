"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good outcome.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $105 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $97.50?  That seems like a fair price for both of us.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. I'm willing to drop my price to $102.50, which is a fair compromise that's closer to your offer. Let's make a deal.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $102.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That would be a fair price for both of us and get this deal done.",100.0,Bob,6,
