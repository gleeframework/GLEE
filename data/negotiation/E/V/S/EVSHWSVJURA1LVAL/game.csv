"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-end product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of a price of $15000 for it. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $11000. Can you consider that?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for it. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for it. I can offer it to you for $12500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $12500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $11500. Can you consider that?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a price we can both agree on. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11500. I can offer it to you for $12000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $12000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $11500, and that's my final offer. Can you consider it?",11500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made a lot of concessions so far, and I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a fair price. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $12000. I'm willing to throw in a free upgrade to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to throw in an upgrade, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $11000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000.",11000.0,Bob,10,
