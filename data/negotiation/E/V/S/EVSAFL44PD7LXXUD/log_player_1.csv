Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at the highest possible point while also conveying a sense of fairness.  Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, it's a good starting point for a potential bargain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still a 30% reduction from the product's value to Bob. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price, and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $850,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. It's a bit closer to your initial offer, but still a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** While I'd prefer more, $750,000 is still a significant sum and a good deal considering Bob's initial offer of $700,000.
* **Time:**  Further negotiation risks losing time and potentially ending up with nothing.
* **Security:**  John's offer provides a safety net, but it's not ideal. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale with a good profit.

This decision prioritizes a reasonable profit over potentially maximizing the sale price."
