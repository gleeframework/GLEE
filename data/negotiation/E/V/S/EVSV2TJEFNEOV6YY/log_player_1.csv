Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and doesn't risk immediately pushing him away. It also sets the stage for you to potentially secure a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,500 is tempting, it's below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,750. This price reflects the unique value it offers, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9750} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand your position and respect the value of your product. I would like to propose a price of $9,600 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise and hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,600 is still below my minimum threshold of $10,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, I'm not confident I can get a better deal from Bob, and it's possible he could continue to lower his offers.  John's offer of $10,000 is a safe and guaranteed option, so I'll choose to sell to John."
