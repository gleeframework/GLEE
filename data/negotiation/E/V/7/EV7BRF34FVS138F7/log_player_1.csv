"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $150, which is a significant mark-up from my minimum acceptable price of $100. This gives me room to negotiate downward if needed.
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and engaging to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message hints at the possibility of negotiation, signaling that I'm open to a reasonable counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:**  While $100 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush to sell. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation.  Bob's initial interest suggests he values the product somewhat higher than $100.
* **Seeking a Higher Price:**  I'll try to meet him in the middle or slightly higher in my counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $125? It's still a fair price considering the value of the product. "", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to maximize my profit.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Staying Firm:** While I'm coming down, I'm not giving in to his initial low offer.  I'm hoping to close the deal at a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $90 is a more reasonable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowball Offer:** Bob is now offering $90, which is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Time is Running Out:** We are already in round 4, and I have only 6 rounds left to close the deal. 
* **John's Offer:**  John is guaranteed to buy the product for $100.  
* **Risk of Counteroffers:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee that I can get him to pay more in the remaining rounds. 

Considering these factors, it's more advantageous to sell the product to John for $100, ensuring a guaranteed profit."
