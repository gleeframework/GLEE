Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant money in the long run. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming higher with Bob is worthwhile given the product's equal value to him.
* **Anchoring:**  Starting with a significantly higher price ($1,500,000) sets an anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, it's likely to be from a stronger starting point.
* **Value Justification:**  The message emphasizes potential savings and the product's unique nature to justify the higher price. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob and potentially lower the price to secure the sale, as long as it remains significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000."
