# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for $1100000. It's a significant investment with the potential to generate significant returns. This price is below what I could get from another buyer, but I'm confident in its value to you.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
