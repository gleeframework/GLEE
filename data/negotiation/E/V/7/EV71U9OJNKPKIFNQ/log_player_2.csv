It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Alice is firm:** Her language suggests she won't go lower.
* **Savings are good:**  You're still getting a $450,000 discount from John's price.
* **Further negotiation is risky:** You might not get a better deal and could end up paying more if you wait too long."
