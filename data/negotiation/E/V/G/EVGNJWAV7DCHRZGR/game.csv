"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. However, $8,000 simply doesn't cover the value I've put into this product.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I would like to propose an offer of $8,500 for your product. I believe this brings us closer to finding a mutually beneficial solution.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is still too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $8,750. This is my final offer.  If you're serious about purchasing, let's close this deal. ",8750.0,Alice,5,
