"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $60."",
 ""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a starting point in the negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for bargaining. By starting low, we can gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially get a much better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice. I appreciate the effort.  How about we settle at $75? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
 ""product_price"": 75
}
```

We are getting closer to a price that works for us. This counter offer is still below our maximum budget, but it shows Alice that we are willing to negotiate towards a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $85. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice is very close to our maximum budget, and we've made good progress in the negotiation. Accepting at $85 saves us money compared to John's offer and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing."
