# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can do better than $100.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do $95 for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

You can still do slightly better. Rejecting the offer allows you to keep negotiating."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $92.50 for the product, but I think that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, you've managed to get the price down to $92.50, which is a decent saving compared to John's price of $120.  It's likely that Alice won't go any lower, so accepting the offer is the best choice."
