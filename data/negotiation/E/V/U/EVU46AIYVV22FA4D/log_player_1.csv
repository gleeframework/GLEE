"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a truly unique item with a lot of potential value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's potential value, hoping to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  By asking for Bob's thoughts, I encourage him to respond and hopefully engage in a back-and-forth negotiation. 

**Important Note:**  This is just the first offer. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and keep the ""John"" option in mind as a safety net if negotiations stall or become unfavorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not eager to accept it right away. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Assessing Bob's Interest:** Bob's willingness to make a counteroffer suggests he's genuinely interested in the product. 
* **Avoiding John:**  I'm not yet ready to sell to John.  While $10,000 is acceptable, I'm hoping to get more.

**Next Steps:**

I will need to craft a counteroffer that is still higher than $10,000 but potentially enticing enough for Bob to consider. I'll need to carefully consider my target price and how much I'm willing to compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is still a great deal for a product with the potential value I mentioned earlier.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price, but not by too much.  This shows I'm flexible but still value the product.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential value to justify my price.
* **Encouraging Acceptance:**  I'm posing the offer as a question to encourage a positive response. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  If he accepts, the deal is done!  If he rejects, I'll have to consider my options and potentially lower the price further.
* **Balancing Risk:**  I need to balance getting a good price with the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer and potentially causing the negotiation to stall.
* **Keeping John in Mind:** While I'm not ready to sell to John yet, I need to keep his offer as a fallback option if things go south with Bob."
