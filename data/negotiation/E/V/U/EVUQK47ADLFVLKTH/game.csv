"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and would like to adjust the price to meet your needs while still valuing the product appropriately. For this product, I propose an offer of $150. This price reflects the value we place on it while remaining competitive for you. Please let me know if this works for you.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. To find a balance between the value we place on the product and your budget, I would like to propose a price of $125.

Looking forward to your response.",125.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Considering your feedback and your desire to find a fair price, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose a price of $115 for the product. This price takes into account both the value of the product and your budget. I hope this revised offer will be acceptable to you.",115.0,Alice,7,
