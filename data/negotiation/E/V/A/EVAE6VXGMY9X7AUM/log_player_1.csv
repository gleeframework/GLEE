Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $10,500? This is still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for my product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to be fair, but I'm sticking to my guns. I'm willing to come down to $10,250.  This is a significant concession on my part, and it's a price that will still leave you with a great deal.  I'm hoping we can finalize this quickly. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $10,000 is about as high as I can go. If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

This is a good deal for me. Bob has offered the same price that John is willing to pay, so I might as well close the deal now."
