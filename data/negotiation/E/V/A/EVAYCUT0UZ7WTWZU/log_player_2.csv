{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **You have room to negotiate.** There are 9 more rounds, giving you ample opportunity to try and get a better price.
* **Buying from John is always an option.** If you can't get a better deal with Alice, you can always fall back to John's offer."

Round 2

{""product_price"": 750000}
```

* **Aggressive opening:**  Start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's price, showing your willingness to negotiate.

* **John's offer is a safety net.** You can always secure the product from John if negotiations with Alice fail."
