"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I'm looking for a serious buyer, and I believe you may be the right person for this.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1800000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. I'm willing to negotiate further, but that's my starting point.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800000 is below my target price. I'm willing to consider a compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for the product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1100000? This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, $1100000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we aim for $1300000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm  really trying to make this work, but $1300000 is still a stretch for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1200000. I'm ready to finalize the deal at that price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, $1200000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1300000, but I'll throw in a small bonus or warranty to sweeten the deal?",1300000.0,Alice,7,
