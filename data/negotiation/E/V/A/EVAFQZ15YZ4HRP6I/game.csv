"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $11,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth it!",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to meet you at $13,250, which is just a little above the middle ground. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it!",13250.0,Alice,5,
