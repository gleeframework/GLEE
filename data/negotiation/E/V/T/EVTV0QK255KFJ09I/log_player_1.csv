Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly moving towards our desired price point, but we're still significantly above his perceived value. We have room to negotiate further and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but my price reflects the real value of this product. Let's settle this at $1,850,000, a final offer from my side."", 
""product_price"": 1850000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer to Bob's limit, and it's time to signal some firmness. This offer is a strong compromise, splitting the difference between our previous offer and his while still staying significantly above his perceived value and our guaranteed offer from John.  It also introduces a sense of finality that might prompt him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a deal that works for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While we'd ideally like to get closer to $1,700,000, Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is still a significant profit above our guaranteed sale to John. It's getting late in the negotiation, and there's a risk Bob might walk away if we push further. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing him as a buyer."
