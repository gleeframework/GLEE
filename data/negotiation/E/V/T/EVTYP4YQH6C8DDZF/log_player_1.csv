"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount of money, I'm aiming for a higher price. Bob's offer is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing negotiations.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can secure a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,100,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $950000 is a fair price. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied.  There are only 6 rounds left, and I want to maximize my profit. I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially considering John's offer of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're getting closer to my price range. However, $950,000 is still not quite there for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,025,000. This shows good faith on my part, and it's a great opportunity for you to secure this valuable product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1000000. How about $990000? I think that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $990,000 is very close to my minimum price, but I'm running out of time. With only 4 rounds remaining, I risk getting stuck in a cycle of counteroffers that won't get me the price I want.  John's offer of $1,000,000 is a guaranteed sale and a higher price than Bob's current offer.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing."
