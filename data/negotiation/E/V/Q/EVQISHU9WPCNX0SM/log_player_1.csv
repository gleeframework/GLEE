"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant markup from your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation and still leaves Bob with a considerable profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is a good starting point, I can still likely get a higher price. It is worth trying to negotiate a higher price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still leaving myself a good profit margin. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not giving away the product for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $980,000 is tempting, I'm still confident I can get a higher price. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my price further, but still maintaining a good profit margin. This offer shows Bob I'm serious about negotiating, but I'm not willing to go below a certain price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting too low, and I'm nearing my minimum acceptable price.  It's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach a deal, and I risk losing time and potentially more money if I keep negotiating.  It's best to sell to John now and secure the $1,000,000."
