I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.,20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can do better than $12000. I'll counteroffer at $16000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14000, but that's my absolute limit. I'm really interested in the product, so I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to negotiate, but I've already met you halfway and even a bit more. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'll counteroffer at $15500. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $15500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13500, but I really think we can do better than that. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. Can you consider $14000?",14000.0,Bob,6,
