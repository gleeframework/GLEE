"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, and I believe it could be very valuable to you. Let's start with a fair price. How about $150?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to meet me at $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understand your budget constraints. I'd like to offer you the product at $140, which I believe is a fair compromise.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $130. Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see, Bob. Thank you for your offer. I would like to counter with $135 for the product. This is the highest price I can offer given its value to me.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty about the product's value to you, Alice. I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll offer $132.50 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",132.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. Considering the value of the product to me, I am willing to accept $134 for it. This feels like a fair compromise.",134.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $134 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $132, but that's as high as I'm comfortable going. Would you be willing to meet me at $132?",132.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Considering the negotiations we've had so far, I am willing to sell the product to you for $133. This feels like a fair price given the value of the product to both of us.",133.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $133 is still a bit too high for me. I'm at my limit, and I'm starting to consider buying from John for $120. If you're willing to meet me at $130, I'll take the product from you. Otherwise, I'll have to walk away.",130.0,Bob,10,
