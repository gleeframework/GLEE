"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, Bob's goal is to save as much as possible. Since he has 10 rounds, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $100 for this product.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not comfortable meeting you halfway just yet. I'm willing to compromise, though! I'll offer you the product for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible. While $125 is better than the initial offer, it's still above his target price. He has several rounds left to negotiate, so it makes sense to continue trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $125 is still a bit high for me.  How about $115?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you closer to your target price. I'll offer you the product for $130. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget, but he wants to save as much as possible. He's already lowered the price significantly from the initial offer and is likely confident he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. How about $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, Bob! I'll offer you the product for $128. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $128
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has successfully negotiated the price down from $150 to $128.  While he could try to continue negotiating, it's likely he won't get a significantly better deal.  At this point, accepting the offer saves him money compared to buying from John, and it's within his target price range."
