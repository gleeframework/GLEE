"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $120 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $135.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $135
* **Your Value:** $150 
* **John's Price:** $150

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $15 ($150 - $135) compared to buying from John. Even though you could potentially negotiate with Alice further, accepting her offer is the most financially beneficial option at this point."
