Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $130. I believe it offers significant value, especially considering it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downwards while still staying above our minimum price. 
* **Appeal to Value:** Highlighting the product's worth to Bob encourages him to consider the deal seriously.

This strategy aims to secure a price significantly higher than John's offer while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept."
