"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. This seems like a fair price considering the value of the product for me. Let's try to find some common ground.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price that respects the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
