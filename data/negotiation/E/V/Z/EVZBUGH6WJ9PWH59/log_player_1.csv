Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. It's a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate. I know I have a fallback option with John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob won't meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still below what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000.  This is a compromise, meeting halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  Hopefully, this shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a fair price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's the same price John is offering, so there's no reason to keep negotiating. I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
