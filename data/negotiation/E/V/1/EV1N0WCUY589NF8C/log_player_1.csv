"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.  Given its value and features, I'm asking for $22,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with an offer significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This allows room for negotiation and potential concessions.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  This first offer will help gauge Bob's level of interest and flexibility. His response will give insight into how much he values the product and how far he might be willing to go.
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping the option of selling to John for $15,000 in mind provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, Alice can walk away and still secure a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is still below his own perceived value of the product ($10,000). This indicates room for negotiation.
* **Below Minimum:** Accepting $14,000 would be a loss for Alice, as it's below her minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **John as Leverage:** Alice has the security of selling to John for $15,000. This allows her to confidently reject Bob's offer and aim for a price closer to her target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your budget concerns, Bob, but $14,000 is significantly below the value this product provides.  I could consider coming down to $19,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true worth of what's being offered."", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Alice needs to show some flexibility to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation. Coming down $3,000 from the initial offer demonstrates willingness to make a deal.
* **Still Above Value:**  The new offer of $19,000 remains comfortably above both Bob's perceived value and Alice's minimum.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value, Alice reinforces the idea that her offer is reasonable and not arbitrary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $19,000. How about $16,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $16,500 is now above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This means she would make a profit.
* **Strong Counter:** Bob meeting in the middle is a strong counter-argument, suggesting he's getting close to his upper limit. 
* **Time Value:** While Alice could try to push for a little more, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations."
