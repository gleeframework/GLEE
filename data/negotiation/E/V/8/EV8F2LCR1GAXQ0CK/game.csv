"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  Given the value to me, I'd be happy to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000,  which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can agree on that.",11000.0,Bob,4,
