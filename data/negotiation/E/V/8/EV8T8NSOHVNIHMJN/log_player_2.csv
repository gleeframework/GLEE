"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a very reasonable price. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While you could get the product from John for $150, Alice's offer of $120 is a better deal for you. You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice's price is lower, meaning you save $30."
