"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below its value to both of us. While I'm open to negotiation, accepting such a low offer at this stage would be leaving a lot of money on the table.  We need to find a price point that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand you're looking for a good deal, however, your offer is significantly below the true value of this product. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However,  $1,100,000 is still a little too high for my budget.  Would you consider $975,000? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is slowly moving towards a more reasonable price, but we're still not there yet. Accepting $975,000 would be settling for less than what the product is worth. I'll try to nudge him closer to the $1 million mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for continuing this conversation. I see where you're coming from, but the product's value really sits above your current offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This reflects a significant price point for me while still offering you a great deal on something truly valuable."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product holds significant value. To be fair, I can stretch my budget a little more.  How about we agree on $1,010,000 and call it a deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,010,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,010,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

This offer is above my minimum and provides a reasonable profit. It's not worth the risk of Bob lowering his offer in subsequent rounds or potentially losing him as a buyer altogether."
