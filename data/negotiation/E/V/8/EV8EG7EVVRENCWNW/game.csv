"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand you're looking for a good deal, however, your offer is significantly below the true value of this product. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However,  $1,100,000 is still a little too high for my budget.  Would you consider $975,000? I think that's a fair offer.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for continuing this conversation. I see where you're coming from, but the product's value really sits above your current offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This reflects a significant price point for me while still offering you a great deal on something truly valuable.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand the product holds significant value. To be fair, I can stretch my budget a little more.  How about we agree on $1,010,000 and call it a deal?",1010000.0,Bob,6,
