Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$130:** This price is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $100, and it leaves room for negotiation. It also leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal since it's below his estimated value of $150. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and encouraging. It avoids being overly aggressive or demanding."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is better than selling to John, I still have room for negotiation.  Bob has shown interest and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob.  $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  I'm confident you'll really enjoy this product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$125:**  This is a compromise that's closer to my desired price while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Message:** I reiterate my confidence in the product and encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'd like to try to get a better price. How about $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $115 is only $5 away from my minimum.  While I would prefer more, at this point I'm close to my bottom line, and it's better to close the deal with Bob than risk losing him and having to settle for $100 from John."
