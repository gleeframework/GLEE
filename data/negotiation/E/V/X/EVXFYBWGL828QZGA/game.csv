"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. Would you consider a lower price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000, which I believe is a fair price.  Let me know if you're open to it.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway and then another quarter of the way. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. I can offer you the product for $850,000. This is as low as I can go and still make a profit.",850000.0,Alice,5,
