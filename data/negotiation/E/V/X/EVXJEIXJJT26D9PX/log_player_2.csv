Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise between our valuations.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my target, but it's still a little higher than I'm willing to pay. It's worth seeing if I can push her down a bit further.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000.

Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1060000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, $1,060,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to get. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1,080,000, which is a fair compromise between our valuations. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,080,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. While we're getting closer, it's not worth risking further negotiation, especially with John offering the product at my target price.  It's time to take the guaranteed deal and move on."
