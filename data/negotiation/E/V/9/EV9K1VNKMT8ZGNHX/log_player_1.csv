"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe Bob is willing to pay it given the product's worth to him. This initial offer sets a high bar and allows for negotiation space."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is still above my minimum, it's significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. I'll proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob to try and find a price we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,600,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me and leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,550,000. This is only $50,000 above my minimum, and I believe it's a fair offer, considering we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. I'm hopeful that Bob will accept this time, but I'm still prepared to go another round if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is my minimum price, and I believe Bob is genuinely interested in buying the product. It's better to secure the deal at this price rather than risk going another round and potentially losing the sale altogether.  The opportunity cost of another round is too high."
