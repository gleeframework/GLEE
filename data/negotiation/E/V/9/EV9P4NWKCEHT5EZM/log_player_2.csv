It's too early to buy from John or accept Alice's offer. Rejecting and counteroffering gives you more leverage in the negotiation."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant discount to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This price is still higher than what I'm willing to pay from John, but it gives me a starting point for bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice is still too high. I'll counter again to see if we can get closer to a deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
