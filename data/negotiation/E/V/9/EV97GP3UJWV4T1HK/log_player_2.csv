"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more than that! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is better than $120, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but still within the range where both parties could potentially profit. It also shows that Bob is serious about buying the product, but is willing to negotiate.  This opens the door for further dialogue."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a little too low for me.  How about $110?  That's still a great price for the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still not within his target range of $120 or lower.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a little high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $107.50.  I'm really interested in this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Bob is willing to meet Alice halfway. The price is still under Bob's target of $120, and it shows a willingness to negotiate further.  This approach aims to build a sense of fairness and encourage Alice to accept."
