"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a little too low for me.  How about $110?  That's still a great price for the value you're getting.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a little high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $107.50.  I'm really interested in this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
