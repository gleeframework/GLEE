Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $10,500, which is still a great deal for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

While Alice is coming down in price, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. John's offer of $10,000 is the best guaranteed price."
