Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which both you and Bob would be willing to make a deal exist between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high while still giving Bob a reason to accept.  Here's a possible approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Opening:** This price is close to your guaranteed amount from John, maximizing your potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message vaguely implies the product's ""unique value,"" potentially justifying the high price without revealing your guaranteed sale to John.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly lower to give yourself more room to negotiate.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a less aggressive opening price. 

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
