"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. My initial offer is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get close to the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is a good starting point, but Bob can likely get a better price.  There are still 9 rounds left, so it makes sense to try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit high for me at this point. I'd be willing to pay $800,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $800,000. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, but I believe the product's value to you is closer to $1,200,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, there's still room for negotiation.  There are several rounds remaining, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer to continue pushing for a lower price is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $950,000 is closer to where I'd like to be, but let's try to split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think the product's value to you is closer to the higher end of the spectrum. I'm willing to come down to $920,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer in this range. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has been consistently pushing for a lower price, but at this point, Alice's offer of $920,000 is a good deal.  It's only $20,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer, and with only five rounds remaining, it's likely that continuing to negotiate won't yield a significantly better price. Accepting the offer means Bob gets the product for a price well below his maximum and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
