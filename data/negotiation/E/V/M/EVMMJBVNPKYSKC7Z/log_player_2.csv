Bob should reject the offer.  While it's tempting to go for the deal,  Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? That's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $11,250 is still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price, and there's room for negotiation.  He should counteroffer again, trying to get closer to his desired price."
