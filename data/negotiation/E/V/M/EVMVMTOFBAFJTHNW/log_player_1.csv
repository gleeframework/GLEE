Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is far beyond my budget.  Given my understanding of the product, I'm willing to offer you $800000.  I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in this item.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
