"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $600,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate.

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $500,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $525,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",525000.0,Alice,5,
