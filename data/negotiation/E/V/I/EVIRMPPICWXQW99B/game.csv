"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering our options, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the product's value, but that price point is a little too high for me. How about we meet halfway at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $900,000. Would you be willing to consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. I'm now offering the product to you for $975,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
