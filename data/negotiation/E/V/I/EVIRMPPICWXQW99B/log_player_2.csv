# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering our options, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?

I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. I'm now offering the product to you for $975,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below John's price. It's better to secure the product at $1,000,000 from John than to risk further negotiation with Alice."
