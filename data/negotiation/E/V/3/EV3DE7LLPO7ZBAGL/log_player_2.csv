"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point.  There's no immediate benefit to accepting.  Rejecting allows you to see if Alice is willing to negotiate lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you consider $125? "", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $125 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140?  It's still a great deal for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $140, which is still within my budget and a good deal considering my initial offer of $125.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my offer again, and I may end up paying the full $150 to John.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at a slightly lower price than John's."
