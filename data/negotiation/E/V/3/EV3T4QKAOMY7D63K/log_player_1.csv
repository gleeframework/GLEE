Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but he's still far below our $1,000,000 walk-away point. At this rate, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's acceptable to us within the remaining rounds.  John represents a guaranteed sale at our desired price, so it's time to cut our losses with Bob and move on to the guaranteed deal."
