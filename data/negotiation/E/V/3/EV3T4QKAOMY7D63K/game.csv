"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. It's incredibly valuable and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you.  I'm initially offering it for $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects its value while still offering you a significant gain from its use.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,100,000 is still too high for my budget. I could consider $700,000. This offer reflects my strong interest in the product while remaining financially feasible for me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's try $950,000. This represents a significant reduction on my part while acknowledging the product's intrinsic worth.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point that works for me.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to stretch to $750,000, which I believe is a fair offer considering its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,6,
