,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $12,000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still too high for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $10,000? That would be a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $14,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $11,000. Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I have to say, I'm getting a bit anxious about selling it to you at this price. It's a great product, and I want to make sure I'm getting a fair deal.",13000.0,Alice,7,
