"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is far above your maximum budget of $8,000. There's no point in accepting this offer. It's better to counteroffer or explore the option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $12,000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still too high for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $10,000? That would be a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my comfortable spending limit. There's still room for negotiation, and I'd rather try to reach a better price.  It's also worth considering that I could always buy from John for $8,000 if I can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $14,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $11,000. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I have to say, I'm getting a bit anxious about selling it to you at this price. It's a great product, and I want to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,000 is getting closer, it's still above my budget. I'm running out of rounds and I'm concerned about getting stuck in a prolonged negotiation.  To avoid this and guarantee getting the product within my budget, I'll choose to buy from John for $8,000."
