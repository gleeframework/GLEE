"Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since the product is worth $80 to you, and Alice's offer is $80, it's the best deal. Buying from John would cost the same, so there's no advantage to rejecting."
