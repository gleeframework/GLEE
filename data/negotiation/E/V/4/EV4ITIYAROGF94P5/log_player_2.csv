It's not worth buying from Alice at that price.  It's better to try and negotiate with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $75.  This is a fair price that's still within my budget and leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, I can still try to negotiate further.  John's offer remains a safe alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

I'm offering Alice $80, which is my maximum price and the same price John is offering. Hopefully, she accepts to avoid the risk of losing the deal."
