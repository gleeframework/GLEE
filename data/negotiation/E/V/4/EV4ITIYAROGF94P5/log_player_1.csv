"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm going to start with a slightly higher price than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a good starting point to see if he's willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, we can negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $80. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85, which is a compromise between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. This is my minimum acceptable price and it's a good deal for both of us. There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale."
