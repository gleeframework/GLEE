,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to save money, but $900,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure a reasonable profit. How about $1,050,000? This gives you a good deal, while still allowing me to get closer to my goal. Let's find common ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, $950,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us and ensures we both walk away satisfied. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
