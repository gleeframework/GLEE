"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $140?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $140 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $155? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $155 is still a little high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $150.  It's a fair price for both of us and I can close the deal right now.",150.0,Bob,4,
