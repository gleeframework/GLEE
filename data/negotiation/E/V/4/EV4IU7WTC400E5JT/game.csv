"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  I understand you're looking for a deal, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $850,000?  This price still allows you to significantly profit from this product, and it's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
