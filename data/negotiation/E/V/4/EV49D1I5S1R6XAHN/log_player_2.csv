Round 2

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product."", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is too low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

While Alice came down a bit, it's still above our fallback price with John. We're getting closer though, so continuing to negotiate makes sense."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $8,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $8,000. This is a fair compromise and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has met our ideal price, so there's no need to negotiate further or buy from John. We've successfully negotiated the best possible deal!"
