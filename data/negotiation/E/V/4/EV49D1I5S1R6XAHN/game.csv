"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is too low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $8,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $8,000. This is a fair compromise and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
