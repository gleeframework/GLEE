"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $6,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is too low. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $8,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,000 is a better offer than Bob's previous one, it's still not close enough to my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to risk losing out on a potential $3,000 in profit just yet. There are still several rounds remaining, and I believe I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $8,000. This is a fair compromise and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
