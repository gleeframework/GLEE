"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $110. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is lower than her value for the product, but still above your maximum price. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do it for $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

This counteroffer aims to bring the price closer to my budget while leaving room for further negotiation. It also signals my interest in the product, encouraging Alice to continue the discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $95 for the product? I hope this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down in price, and $95 is a good deal, saving you $5 compared to John's offer. It's unlikely you'll get a better offer from Alice."
