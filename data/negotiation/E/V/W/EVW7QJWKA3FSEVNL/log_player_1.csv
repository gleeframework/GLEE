{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  It's a fair price considering its value and potential.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob to increase his interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm indicating that I'm open to discussion and negotiation, making the offer less intimidating. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while still being open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.**  
* **Selling to John guarantees a better outcome at this point.** While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's initial counteroffer is too low.  
* **Rejecting and counteroffering allows me to potentially increase the price.**  I'll aim for a middle ground that's still profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's try to find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within my range:**  $12,000 is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **Emphasis on value and deal:**  I reiterate the product's value while also framing the price as a good deal for Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message again emphasizes my willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. 

This counteroffer aims to:

* Maintain a profitable price point.
* Increase the chances of a successful negotiation with Bob.
* Avoid selling to John at a lower price than I'd prefer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $12000 is not within my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.** While it's closer, it doesn't make sense for me to sell at a loss. 
* **Selling to John guarantees a better outcome.** John's offer is higher and provides a secure, guaranteed deal.
* **Counteroffering again risks a prolonged negotiation and potentially a lower price.** 

In this situation, the risk associated with further negotiation outweighs the potential benefits. I'm choosing to secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $10,500. This price reflects the value of the product while giving you a fair price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within a reasonable range:** $10,500 is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **Emphasis on fair price:** I'm framing my counteroffer as fair to both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm still willing to discuss and potentially adjust the price further to reach an agreement.

**Why not sell to John immediately?**

While selling to John for $10,000 is guaranteed, I still want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob.  Counteroffering at $10,500 gives me a chance to secure a higher price while still being open to negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $10500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9800 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.** This is the fourth round of negotiation, and it's clear Bob is unlikely to go significantly higher.
* **Selling to John is the most logical choice.** It guarantees a higher price than Bob's offer and eliminates the risk of further negotiations with Bob potentially leading to a lower price.
* **Time is a factor.**  Continuing to negotiate could prolong the process and potentially lead to a loss of opportunity with John or another buyer.

While I'm open to negotiating, in this instance, it's more advantageous to secure the guaranteed $10,000 from John rather than risking a lower price with Bob."
