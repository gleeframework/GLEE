"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $999000 is a tempting price, but I'm hoping to come in a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product.  This is a significant offer, and I'm sure we can find a deal that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable going down to $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $950000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity.",950000.0,Alice,3,
