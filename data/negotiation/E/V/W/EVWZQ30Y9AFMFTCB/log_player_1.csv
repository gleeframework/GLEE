Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still exceeding your minimum price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a price significantly higher than your guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The phrase ""limited time"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. If he's a savvy negotiator, he might realize you have a backup buyer and try to lowball you. However, this offer presents a strong starting point to maximize your potential profit."
