,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure if $1800000 is within my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle at $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this deal. Considering your initial offer of $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between that and my original offer of $1800000. Let's aim for a price of $1650000.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $1650000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of $1475000. Can we meet in the middle?",1475000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'll meet you at $1550000, which is slightly above your latest offer. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1550000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1525000, but I'd like to propose a slightly lower price of $1495000. Can we meet in the middle?",1495000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1512500, but I need to emphasize that this is my final offer. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1512500.0,Alice,7,
