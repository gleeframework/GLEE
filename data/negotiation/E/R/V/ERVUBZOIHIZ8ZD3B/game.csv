"I understand your position, Bob, but $100 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get. How about we meet in the middle at $170?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $170 is still too high for me.  Let's try $125.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.",125.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To make this work, I need to get at least $150 for it. That's my final offer.",150.0,Alice,5,
