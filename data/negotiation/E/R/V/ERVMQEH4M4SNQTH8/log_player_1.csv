Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals and constraints:

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still ensuring Alice gets significantly more than John's $10,000 offer. 
* **Time Value:** Offering it to Bob first at a desirable price could lead to a faster sale, which has its own value.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiating style or financial limitations."
