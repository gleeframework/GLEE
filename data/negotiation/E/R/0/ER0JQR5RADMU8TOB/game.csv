"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $8,500 is your current limit.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'd be happy to sell for $9,500. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for coming down to $9,500. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",9000.0,Bob,4,
