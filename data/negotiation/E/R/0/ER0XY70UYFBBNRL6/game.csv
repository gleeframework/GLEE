"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is considerably below its market value.  I'm willing to be flexible, how about we meet halfway at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,225,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
