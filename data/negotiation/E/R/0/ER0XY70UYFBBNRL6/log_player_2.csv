"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiation at $1,600,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,600,000 is far above his budget and he can get a better deal from John or by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is considerably below its market value.  I'm willing to be flexible, how about we meet halfway at $1,225,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving in the right direction, $1,225,000 is still too high for Bob. He should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,225,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, the product's value significantly exceeds your offer. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, $1,100,000 is still too high. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further, and if not, he can always buy from John for a guaranteed price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $1,100,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
