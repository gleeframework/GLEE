Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6

Although I could hold out for a price closer to John's offer, accepting Bob's $1,000,000 offer makes the most sense at this point.  Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  $1,000,000 is a substantial profit over my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids further delays and allows me to reinvest the earnings sooner.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing the negotiation might not yield a significantly better offer from Bob.

Accepting a sure $1,000,000 now outweighs the risk of potentially getting a slightly higher offer from Bob later."
