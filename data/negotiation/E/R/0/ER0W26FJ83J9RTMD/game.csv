"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to my minimum price as possible.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product is only worth $10,000 to me, and I know I can get a similar one elsewhere. How about we start at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $12,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a good value.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a little, but $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm serious about finding a fair deal, so I can offer $9,500. However, if we can't agree on something closer to that, I might have to explore other options.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me halfway, I'm open to negotiating further. How about we try $10,750?",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer.  I'm willing to go up slightly, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and call it $10,375?  That's my final offer, Alice.",10375.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,375. I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $11,250? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a good value.",11250.0,Alice,7,
