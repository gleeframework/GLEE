Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product is only worth $10,000 to me, and I know I can get a similar one elsewhere. How about we start at $8,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a little, but $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm serious about finding a fair deal, so I can offer $9,500. However, if we can't agree on something closer to that, I might have to explore other options.
