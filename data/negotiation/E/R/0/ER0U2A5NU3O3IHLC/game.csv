"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $900,000? This price still allows for a significant profit for you, while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I value your continued interest in the product.  $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $890,000.
