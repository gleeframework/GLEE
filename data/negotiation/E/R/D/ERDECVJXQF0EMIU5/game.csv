"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're on a tight budget, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at $9000. However, I'm willing to compromise and make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11000. It's still a great deal, and I think it's worth the investment. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking of offering $10500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $10500. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10800. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10800. I'm willing to offer $10200. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",10200.0,Bob,6,
