"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price. Given its value to you, I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement. I am offering it to you for $100, which is a significant discount from its original value and still a great deal considering its worth to you. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is less than your maximum budget, you can potentially get a better price. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and knows you're interested. By rejecting this offer, you might prompt her to counter with a lower price, bringing you closer to the $80 value she places on it."
