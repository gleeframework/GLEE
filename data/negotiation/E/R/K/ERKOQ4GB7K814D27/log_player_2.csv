"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. However, $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000.  This would give you a good price and allow me to get closer to my target. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price:**  $11,000 is a good compromise, bringing the price down significantly from Alice's initial offer and closer to Bob's target of $10,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer could lead to a longer negotiation process, potentially resulting in more rounds and an increased chance of needing to buy from John at the higher price.
* **Time is a factor:** Bob has a limited number of rounds to make a deal. Accepting the offer secures the product at a decent price without risking losing it to John or prolonging the negotiation."
