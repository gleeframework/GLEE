Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still get a higher price.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000.  This would give you a good price and allow me to get closer to my target. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
