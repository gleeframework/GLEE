"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $17,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This is a bad starting offer from Alice.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'll definitely buy from John at $10,000 if Alice doesn't come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a low offer to see how much Alice is willing to move. This gives me the most room to negotiate upwards.
* **Anchoring:** By starting low, I'm trying to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to my desired price range.
* **Leaving Room:** Even though my maximum is $10,000, I'm leaving some room to negotiate upwards if needed.

This strategy aims to get a good deal while understanding that I have the fallback option of buying from John for $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate. $9,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  It's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down, but $14,000 is still too high. I'm sticking to my strategy and willing to see if she'll move closer to my range. The risk of her walking away is outweighed by the potential savings. I'll keep John as my safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Apparent):**  I'm suggesting a price that *appears* to be a compromise, signaling a willingness to negotiate but still staying above my true limit.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps me gauge how flexible Alice is and if a deal within my budget is realistic. 
* **Maintaining Walk-Away Power:**  I'm still prepared to walk away and buy from John if Alice doesn't budge enough."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer you the product for $13,250. This is a fair price, and it brings us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, but her concessions are getting smaller. While $13,250 is closer, it's still significantly more than John's price. I need to show I'm serious about my budget and won't easily move from my range.  The next counteroffer is crucial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $13,250 is still pushing my budget.  I can do $10,500, and that's my final offer.  It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you agree."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear this is my best and final offer, introducing a sense of urgency.
* **Slight Concession:** I've increased my offer slightly to show willingness to compromise, but I'm still below my absolute limit.
* **Framing:**  I'm emphasizing that this is a fair price and that I'm ready to buy, putting the ball in Alice's court.

**Strategy:**

At this point, Alice knows I have a viable alternative with John. By holding firm at $10,500, I'm aiming to:

1. **Secure a Good Deal:** Ideally, Alice will accept and I'll save $2,500 compared to her initial offer.
2. **Force a Decision:** If she rejects it, I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John, ensuring I don't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $10,500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm prepared to sell for $12,000. It's a fair price, and I believe it's the best we can both do.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not willing to come close enough to my budget.  She's rejected my best offer, and her counter-offer is still significantly higher than what John is willing to sell for. It's time to walk away and take the guaranteed deal with John. 

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Knowing your walk-away point is essential.** I was able to negotiate confidently knowing I had a backup option.
* **Don't be afraid to walk away from a deal.**  Sometimes, the best negotiation tactic is knowing when to cut your losses and pursue other opportunities."
