"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  I'm asking for $20,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $11,000 is cutting it too close. How about we settle at $12,500? This is my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
