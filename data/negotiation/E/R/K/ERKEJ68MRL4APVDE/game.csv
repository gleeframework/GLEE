"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I still believe the product's value to you is significant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm glad to see we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, I still need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $725,000.
