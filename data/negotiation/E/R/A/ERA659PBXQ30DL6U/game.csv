"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. Given the product's value, I'm willing to pay $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it falls significantly short of what I believe the product is worth. This product offers immense potential, and $1,150,000 is a more realistic price reflecting its true value.  Let me know if this works for you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
