"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low at this time.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000? This still leaves you a significant profit, and it's a fair price for the value of this product. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. That's a significant compromise on my part, and it still allows you to profit handsomely from this product.  I'm confident this is a win-win solution.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
