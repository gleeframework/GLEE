"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly motivated to sell as her valuation ($1,000,000) is lower than her asking price ($1,150,000).
* You have a price ceiling of $1,200,000, and John acts as a guaranteed backup at that price.
* Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of negotiating a lower price, closer to her actual valuation.  

**Strategy:** By rejecting the initial offer, you signal to Alice that you're not willing to pay that much. This gives you leverage to potentially negotiate a better deal."
