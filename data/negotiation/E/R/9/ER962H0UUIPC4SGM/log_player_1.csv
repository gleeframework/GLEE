Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Fair offer:** $1,400,000 is a good middle ground, leaving a profit for me and a potential good deal for Bob. 
* **Positive message:** I'm being encouraging and highlighting the value of the product for Bob.

**Next steps:**

* **Bob accepts:** I've earned $1,400,000.
* **Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* **Stalemate:** If the negotiation drags on, I'll have the option to sell to John for my minimum desired price of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $1,300,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum desired value of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's room for further negotiation. I can still try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Risk of selling to John:** If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, I risk losing the chance to sell to John for a higher price. However, the potential for a better deal with Bob is worth the risk at this point. 

**Next steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Remaining firm:** I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Maintaining positive tone:** I'm keeping the negotiation amicable and highlighting the value of the product.

**Next steps:**

* **Bob accepts:**  I've secured a decent price and achieved my goal of getting closer to my minimum desired value.
* **Bob rejects:** I'll need to assess if it's worthwhile to continue negotiating or if it's time to accept John's offer and move on."
