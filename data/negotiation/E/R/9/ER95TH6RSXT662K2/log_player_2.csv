"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will greatly benefit you. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a very high initial offer, much more than you're willing to pay.  Rejecting and counter-offering is the best strategy to start the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product but can only offer $1,000,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your budgetary constraints, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,500,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high. You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so you should keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,500,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm very serious about purchasing this product, and I believe we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as it's my maximum budget."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
