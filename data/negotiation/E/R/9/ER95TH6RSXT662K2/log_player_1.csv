Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product but can only offer $1,000,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, there's still room for negotiation with Bob.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your budgetary constraints, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,500,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price for a product of this caliber."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,500,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm very serious about purchasing this product, and I believe we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as it's my maximum budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a tricky spot. Bob is now matching John's offer, and his language suggests he won't go any higher. Let's analyze:

* **Accepting Bob's offer:** This meets our minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation.
* **Rejecting and countering:** This is risky. Bob might be firm on his ""final offer,"" and we'd be left with John's price anyway.
* **Selling to John:** This guarantees the $1,200,000 but closes the door on potentially getting more from Bob.

Since Bob's offer matches our minimum, and the risk of him walking away is high, it's the safest play to accept.
