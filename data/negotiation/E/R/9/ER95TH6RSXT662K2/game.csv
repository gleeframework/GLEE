,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product but can only offer $1,000,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your budgetary constraints, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,500,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price for a product of this caliber.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,500,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm very serious about purchasing this product, and I believe we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as it's my maximum budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
