"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.**
* **John's offer is also above your budget, but closer to it than Alice's offer.**  You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if you can negotiate with John to lower his price."
