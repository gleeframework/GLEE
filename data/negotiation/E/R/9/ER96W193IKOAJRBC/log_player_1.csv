Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible, while still ensuring the deal is attractive enough for him to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $1,400,000, there might be a possibility for Bob to negotiate down slightly.  However, we've set a strong starting point.
* **Considering the Alternative:** We know John will buy the product for $1,200,000. Our offer to Bob must be significantly more appealing than this fallback option."
