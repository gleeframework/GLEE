I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This leaves a good margin for Bob while still offering me a significant profit. It also gives room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $1,300,000. This is still a good price for both of us, and it shows him that I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,250,000. This is closer to Bob's last offer but still leaves room for some profit. I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to my minimum, but I'm not sure I can get any more from him.  John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a safer bet than trying to squeeze a little more out of Bob.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
