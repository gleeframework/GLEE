"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me. How about we bring it down to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $1,025,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Could we settle at $975,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  $975,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, but I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer.  It represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
