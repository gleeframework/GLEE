{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price but still above Bob's perceived value. This allows for some room to negotiate and potentially reach a deal that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can only justify paying up to $10000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I would get from John.  I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I still feel that $10000 would be a fair price for the product. I'm willing to go up to $10500 if that helps move us closer to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, I'm still more than happy with the $15,000 offer from John. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will get me a higher price, and time is valuable. I'll take the sure thing and sell to John."
