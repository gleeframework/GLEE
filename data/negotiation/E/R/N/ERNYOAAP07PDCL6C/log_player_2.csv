"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. Given its features and value, I'm offering it to you for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you know the product is worth to John. It's best to negotiate down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious starting point:** We're starting with a low offer ($10,000) to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. 
* **Polite and interested:** The message keeps the tone positive and shows we're serious buyers, just aiming for a better price.
* **Leaving room to negotiate:** This counter-offer gives us space to potentially meet in the middle if Alice is unwilling to go this low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 reflects the true value of this product, I understand your budget constraints. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:**  $16,000 is better than the original offer, but it's still significantly above your $12,000 fallback option with John.
* **Room for negotiation:** Alice moving down to $16,000 from $20,000 indicates she's willing to negotiate. We have space to counteroffer and try to meet closer to your desired price range. 
* **Time is a factor:** While we have rounds to spare, it's good to keep the negotiation moving. We don't want to drag it out unnecessarily."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I appreciate the compromise.  To be honest, $14,000 is the absolute highest I can go. If that works, I'm ready to close the deal."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic move towards target:** This offer puts us $2,000 below Alice's last price and closer to our $12,000 limit. 
* **Sense of urgency:** By stating $14,000 is our ""absolute highest,"" we create a sense of urgency and signal that we're serious.
* **Prepared to walk away:**  We're still above John's price, but we need to gauge Alice's flexibility.  If she doesn't budge significantly, we're prepared to go with John."
