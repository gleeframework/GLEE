"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I believe the product is valuable, but your price is a little high for me. Could we agree on $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as it's still a significant profit for me.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $975,000? This would be a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is the best I can do, as it's getting close to the minimum I need to make a profit.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
