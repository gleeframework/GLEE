Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, so I propose $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the asset's worth while acknowledging your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is pushing the boundaries of what I can accept.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,250,000.  This represents a significant concession on my part and underscores my commitment to getting this deal done. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and it's a reasonable price considering her initial asking price and known value to her.  Waiting might not yield a significantly better outcome and risks losing the deal altogether."
