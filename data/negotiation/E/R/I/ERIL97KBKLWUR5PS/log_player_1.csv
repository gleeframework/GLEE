Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $950,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price, which reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about we agree on $1,025,000?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $900,000 is a more reasonable price for me. I'd like to explore that option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable compromise, we still have room to negotiate. We're aiming for the highest possible profit, and settling for $900,000 at this stage feels premature. We'll try to steer him closer to $1,000,000 in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's find a middle ground.  Would you consider $975,000? This reflects my desire to make a deal while acknowledging the product's inherent value."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $925,000 is a more reasonable offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we'd like to push for a higher price, Bob is consistently moving towards a reasonable compromise. Accepting his offer of $925,000 secures a significant profit ($125,000 above our minimum) and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
