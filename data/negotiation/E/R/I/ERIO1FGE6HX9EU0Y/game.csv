"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $155. This is the lowest price I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $155 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can see you're willing to spend $130, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $142.50. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise.",142.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more, but $142.50 is still a tad high for me. How about we settle right in the middle at $136?",136.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not getting the price I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I'll do $139.50. This is my last counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",139.5,Alice,7,
