Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value, I believe it's worth more than $12,000 to you.

This is a fair deal that respects its value while leaving room for both of us to benefit."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  This would still be a good deal for you as it's well above your minimum.  Let me know if you're open to this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"", ""final_price"": 12500}"
