"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $650,000, which would be $725,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. However, $725,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $680,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product while being reasonable for both of us.",680000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $680,000. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you halfway between $725,000 and $680,000, which would be $702,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",702500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $702,500 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $690,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",690000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $690,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $725,000 and $690,000, which would be $707,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",707500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting close. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $695,000.  This is a fair compromise and would allow us to close the deal. What do you say?",695000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $695,000.
