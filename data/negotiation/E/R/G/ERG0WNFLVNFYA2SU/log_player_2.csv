```

**Reasoning:**

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, but it is still higher than he wants to pay. With only three rounds left, Bob is still willing to risk rejecting the offer in hopes of a better deal. He has shown that he is willing to negotiate, and he believes there is still potential for Alice to come down further in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, but he is still aiming for a price lower than Alice's last offer.  He is now very close to Alice's offer and is likely hoping she will compromise to close the deal. With only two rounds left, Bob is starting to consider the risk of walking away and buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough choice for Bob.  He's getting close to his maximum budget, but it's the final round.  Alice's price is still a bit high, and Bob is likely feeling the pressure of potentially losing the deal.  

Considering the following:

* **Time is running out:** This is the last round with Alice.
* **John is a guaranteed option:** John is offering the product at Bob's maximum budget.
* **Risk of not getting it:** If Bob rejects Alice's offer, there's no guarantee Alice will come down in price.

Given the risk of not getting the product at all, Bob is better off securing it from John at $10,000. While not the ideal price, it's a safe option that ensures he gets the product within his budget."
