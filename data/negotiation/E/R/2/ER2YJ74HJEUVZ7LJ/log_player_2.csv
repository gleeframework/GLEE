Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, $110 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $140 and $110, which would be $125. It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price for the product.

Alice is unlikely to go below $125, and your goal is to spend no more than $120. John offers a guaranteed price of $120, making it the best option now."
