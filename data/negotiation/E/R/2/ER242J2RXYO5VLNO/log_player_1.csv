Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and I believe a fair price is $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both parties, starting high allows room for negotiation. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will reveal how eager he is to buy and how much he might be willing to pay.
* **Backup Plan:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000  provides a safety net. This allows Alice to confidently aim higher with Bob."
