"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your offer, but $60 is quite low.  Could you do $130?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $130 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Could you meet me somewhere around $75? That would be a great deal for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $100?",100.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the effort to find a compromise. How about we meet in the middle of our last two offers, say $87? That feels like a fair deal to me.",87.0,Bob,6,
