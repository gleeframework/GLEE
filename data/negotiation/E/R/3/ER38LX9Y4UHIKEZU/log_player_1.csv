{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $130.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good starting point in the negotiation.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter and hopefully come to a mutually agreeable price.  But if the negotiation drags on, I can always fall back on selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $120.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $110 is a good price, I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $115? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115} 
``` 
I'm aiming for a middle ground, hoping Bob will find this price more appealing. If he doesn't, I can still fall back on selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $108 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I don't want to risk going lower. At this point, I'm better off selling the product to John for $120. It's a sure thing and ensures I don't lose money."
