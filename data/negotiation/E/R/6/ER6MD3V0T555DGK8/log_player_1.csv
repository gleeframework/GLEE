Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will be interested, but I'm also prepared to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value and I believe I can get a better price. I'll proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm going to counter Bob with $1,750,000. This is still significantly higher than his offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise.  I believe this price is a fair middle ground and hopefully will entice Bob to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower and lower. While it's tempting to keep negotiating,  $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This is a safe and guaranteed deal that meets my minimum requirements."
