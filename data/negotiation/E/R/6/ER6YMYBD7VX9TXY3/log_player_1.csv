Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good compromise:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000**, which is important for your own financial goals.
* **It's still less than the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000)**, giving him a substantial gain if he accepts.  

This approach increases the likelihood of Bob accepting, while ensuring you get a much better price than John's offer."
