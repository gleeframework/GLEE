"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little from my initial price. How about $13,500? This would still leave you with a great deal, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly. What do you say?",13000.0,Bob,4,
