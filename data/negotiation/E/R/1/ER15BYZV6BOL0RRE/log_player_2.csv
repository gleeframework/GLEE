"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get it for less.  There are still 9 rounds left, providing ample opportunity to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay.
* **Communicates interest:** Bob expresses interest in the product to keep Alice engaged.
* **Sets the stage for negotiation:** This counteroffer creates an opening for further discussion and potentially a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little from my initial price. How about $13,500? This would still leave you with a great deal, and I'd be happy to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price lower than $13,500. While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially secure an even better deal. With 7 rounds remaining, Bob has time to explore options and find a price that works for both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  Bob increases his offer slightly, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but staying within his budget.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  Bob highlights the benefits of the deal for both parties to encourage Alice to accept.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning a quick close creates a sense of urgency and potential pressure on Alice."
