"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $120. I appreciate your interest in the product! After considering it, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $175. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a great value. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $175 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $150 for the product. Can you consider that?",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $160. It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $145 for the product. Can you consider that?",145.0,Bob,6,
