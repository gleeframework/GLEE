Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $150. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still make a profit.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price, even if it's just emphasizing the value, can make it more palatable to the buyer. 
* **Limited Time:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to accept the offer quickly. 

If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can then propose a lower price, gradually approaching $120 to maximize her potential profit."
