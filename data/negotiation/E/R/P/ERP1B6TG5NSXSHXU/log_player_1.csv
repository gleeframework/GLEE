"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable.  I'm offering it to you for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives Bob some incentive to accept, while also allowing me to potentially earn more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product. I am willing to pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $150 to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110}
