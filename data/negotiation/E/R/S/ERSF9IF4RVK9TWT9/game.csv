"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on $875,000.  This is a fair price that's closer to my budget and allows us to reach a deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $875,000 is still a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $890,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",890000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $890,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get it down to $880,000. This would be a good deal for both of us and we could finally close this deal.",880000.0,Bob,6,
