```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than the initial offer, it's still higher than your target price. There's still room for negotiation, and you want to save as much money as possible.  You're closer to your target price, but it's worth continuing to negotiate."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on $875,000.  This is a fair price that's closer to my budget and allows us to reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $875,000 is still a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $890,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your target price, but it's still above your ideal budget.  You've shown willingness to negotiate, and it's worth trying to push for a lower price. You're only a few rounds away from your goal and have the backup option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $890,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get it down to $880,000. This would be a good deal for both of us and we could finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 880000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $880,000 is still a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $885,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is very close to your target price of $800,000. You've already made several counteroffers, and it's unlikely you'll be able to push for a significantly lower price.  Accepting this offer saves you time and potentially avoids further rounds of negotiation, while still getting a relatively good deal."
