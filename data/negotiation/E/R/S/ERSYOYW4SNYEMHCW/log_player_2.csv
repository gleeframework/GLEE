"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her value for the product, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Bob should reject the offer and make a counteroffer to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He's starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  This counteroffer is still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay, while also giving him room to potentially negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant discount from her initial asking price.  While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, it's not a huge price difference and there's a risk Alice might become less willing to negotiate.  It's generally better to accept a fair offer rather than risking a breakdown in negotiations, especially considering the alternative option is to buy the product from John for $1,000,000."
