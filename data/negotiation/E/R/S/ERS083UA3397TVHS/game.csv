"Hi Alice,  $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $200 might be a bit high, but $80 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $110 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I could do $125, and that's my final offer.",125.0,Alice,5,
