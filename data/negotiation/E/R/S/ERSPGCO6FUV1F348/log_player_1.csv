Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $140. It's a steal considering its value! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $130 is still below my minimum, and I have a few more rounds to play with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is still too low for me. How about $135?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $132. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $132 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm not ready to give up on negotiations yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm trying to do the same.  How about we split the difference and go with $133? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 133}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $133. I'm willing to go up to $131. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $131. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $131
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  We're running out of rounds, and it's clear that Bob isn't willing to go above $131.  While I'd like to get closer to my desired price,  I'm not going to risk losing the sale completely.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, and it's the most sensible decision at this point."
