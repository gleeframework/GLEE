"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value of the product ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive message to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm subtly highlighting the value of the product to Bob, even though he already knows its value to him. 

This approach gives me a strong starting point for the negotiation while keeping the door open for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob has lowered his offer significantly from my initial price.  While $110 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm hoping to earn.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not desperate to sell the product right away. 
* **Maintaining Control:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can counter with a price closer to my target.

I'm confident that I can secure a better price than $110 in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to find common ground.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value of $150.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication positive and encouraging Bob to consider the offer, highlighting the value he'll get for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $120, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it's still below my target. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe I can still secure a price closer to my target by continuing the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm confident in the value of my product and don't want to settle for a price that undervalues it.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control and have the opportunity to propose a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $117.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 117}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm continuing to demonstrate my willingness to compromise by offering a price in the middle of Bob's last offer and my previous offer.
* **Close to Target:** $117 is much closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, and it's a good price for me given the time constraint of 10 rounds.
* **Urgency:** The phrase ""Let's close this deal!"" adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept the offer. 

I believe that this offer is attractive enough for Bob to consider, especially since it's a significant improvement from his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to pay $112 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:** We are in round 6, and only 4 rounds remain. The negotiation is getting prolonged, and I'm not sure I can reach my desired price with Bob.
* **Value of John's Offer:** John's offer of $150 is significantly higher than Bob's offer of $112 and meets my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of Lower Offer:** There's a high risk that Bob will continue to lower his offers, and I might end up with a price that is too low.

Given the time constraint and the potential for a better deal with John, it's more advantageous to sell the product to John at this point."
