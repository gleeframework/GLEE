"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your proposal. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a lower price? I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider.  Would you be open to $1,275,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort towards reaching an agreement. However, based on my budget, I am still unable to meet the proposed price.
