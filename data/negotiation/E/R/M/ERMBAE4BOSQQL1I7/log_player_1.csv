Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1,300,000, considering the market value of similar products.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the urgency, but I'm not ready to commit to $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need a bit more wiggle room. How about $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

While I'd like to push for more, Bob is very consistently moving towards his desired price point. Accepting at $1,075,000 locks in a significant profit above my minimum, and avoids the risk of him dropping his offer further in later rounds."
