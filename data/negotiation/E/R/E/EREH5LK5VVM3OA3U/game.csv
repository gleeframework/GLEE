"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I'm working within a budget.  How about we bring the price down significantly?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're working within a budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we compromise at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I still think there's some room to negotiate.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I think $950,000 is the lowest I can go. It's a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
