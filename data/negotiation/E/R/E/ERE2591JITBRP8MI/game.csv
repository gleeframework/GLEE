"Bob, I understand your position, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $140?  I think this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $130? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",130.0,Bob,4,
