"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. Considering your offer of $8,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $9,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $9,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $8,700. Would that work for you?",8700.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. Considering your offer of $8,700, I'm willing to meet you at $9,200. This is my final counteroffer. Let me know if it's acceptable to you.",9200.0,Alice,5,
