Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price.  $10,000 is still below my minimum, and I have more rounds to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you, and it gives me a bit more room to make a profit.  Let's see if we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can close the deal on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the price. I want to push for a little higher to see if I can get closer to my target. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,500 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,750.  This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal.  Let's close this deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 10750}
