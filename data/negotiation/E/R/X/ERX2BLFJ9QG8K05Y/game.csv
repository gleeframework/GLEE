"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $87.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price!",87.5,Alice,3,
