"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm not quite comfortable with that price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $850,000 to you. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about we meet at $875,000? This is a good middle ground that still reflects the product's value to you.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm afraid $875,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $825,000? I feel that's a fair offer considering the market value.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $825,000. I think the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $825,000. How about we try $850,000 again? This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
