Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to give myself room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:** $12,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum value ($15,000), allowing for some flexibility.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is positive and engaging, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000, and even below my initial offer of $12,000. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Room for counteroffer:** I believe there's still room to negotiate. I can counter with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to find a middle ground. 
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me confidence to hold firm in negotiations with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer ($12,000) and his offer ($9,000). 
* **Appeal to fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fair price"" aspect to make the offer more appealing to Bob.
* **Still above my minimum:** $10,500 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going while giving Bob a reasonable opportunity to accept, potentially leading to a sale that's closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to go down to $9,750?  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $9,750 is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Close to John's offer:**  Since John is willing to pay $15,000, I can afford to be more firm with Bob.
* **Possibility for a better deal:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired value than before, I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially secure a price closer to $10,500. 

Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially find a more favorable outcome. If we fail to reach an agreement, I can always turn to John for a guaranteed sale at my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,750 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price. How about $10,000? I think that's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession from my previous offer of $10,500, showing flexibility while still maintaining a price closer to my target.
* **Appeal to Compromise:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to see the value in accepting.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $10,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price ($15,000),  while also being within a range that Bob might consider.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that is both acceptable to Bob and beneficial to me. It allows for a potential agreement while keeping the option of selling to John open if negotiations with Bob fail."
