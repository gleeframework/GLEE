"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to go down to $9,750?  I think that's a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,750 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price. How about $10,000? I think that's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. ",10000.0,Alice,5,
