"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $10,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my original asking price.",10200.0,Alice,5,
