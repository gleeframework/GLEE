"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you have budget constraints, but I'm afraid $1000000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1250000.

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1150000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.
