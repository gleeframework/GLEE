"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal. By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counteroffer and try to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as low as possible. By offering $1,250,000, Bob is testing the waters with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This counteroffer is still within Bob's budget and leaves some room for negotiation. It's a fair starting point for a counteroffer, as Alice has a higher value for the product and is likely motivated to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, and it's closer to John's price than to Bob's target. It makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice in hopes of getting a better deal. By rejecting, Bob can try to push the price down further with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his initial offer and Alice's last offer. By offering $1,300,000, Bob is showing willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price lower than Alice's current offer. This counteroffer is closer to Alice's perceived value of the product, increasing the chance of acceptance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to John's price, and there's a high chance that further negotiation will lead to a price closer to $1,500,000, which is the same as John's offer.  At this point, it's no longer beneficial for Bob to continue negotiating with Alice. Buying from John will guarantee a price within Bob's budget without risking the possibility of a higher price during further negotiation."
