"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with an aggressive price of $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value, but it allows for room to negotiate. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not going to settle for it just yet. I want to see if I can get him to increase his offer, especially considering I offered him a significantly higher price initially. I believe there's room for negotiation and I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, but still higher than Bob's initial offer, demonstrating I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more. I'm aiming to meet him halfway, hoping to get a better deal while still leaving room for future negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,250,000 is a significant improvement from Bob's previous offer, I'm still not convinced this is the best deal I can get.  There's only a $50,000 difference between Bob's current offer and selling to John, and I have several rounds left.  I'm going to keep pushing for a slightly higher price to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,300,000.  This is a small increase from my previous offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product has value. I'm aiming to find a middle ground, hoping to incentivize Bob to close the deal while still leaving room for further negotiations if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offers, and it's just $75,000 less than what John is offering.  With only 4 rounds left, I want to secure a deal and avoid the risk of Bob rejecting my next counteroffer.  I'm confident I can get a better deal than this in the future, but it's better to accept a good offer than to risk losing a deal entirely."
