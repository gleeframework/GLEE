This offer starts the negotiation at a strong point.  It's significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation, but it's also a substantial discount for Bob, making it appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is high for us both, but I am hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we aim for $850,000? I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my desired minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer to try and secure a price closer to my goal."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still gives you a substantial discount.  This price reflects the value of the product to both of us, and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. While $900,000 is an improvement, I still feel there might be room for a better agreement. How about we aim for $875,000? I believe this could be a satisfactory price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it is still below my minimum. I want to see if I can get a bit closer to $900,000.  I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm open to finding a fair price, $875,000 simply doesn't work for me.  Let's compromise at $890,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. Considering our previous discussions, how about we aim for $885,000? I believe this could be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While $885,000 isn't my ideal price, it's only $5,000 below my previous counteroffer and it is above my minimum. It's time to close the deal before Bob changes his mind again or I risk selling to John for a much lower price."
