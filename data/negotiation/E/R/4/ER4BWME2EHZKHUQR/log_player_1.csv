I'm going to try to get a bit closer to my $90 mark.  While $88 is above my minimum of $80, I'd like to see if I can push for a slightly better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more. While $87 is close to my minimum, I'd like to see if I can push for a bit closer to $90. I still have a few rounds left, and I'm not desperate to sell to John yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. Would you consider $89?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 89}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but I still think $86 is a fair price. Can you meet me at that number? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now, and we're not getting any closer to a deal.  While $86 is still above my minimum of $80, I'm worried that I'm running out of time and Bob is unlikely to budge much further.  Rather than risk getting stuck at a price lower than I'd like, I'm going to sell to John for $80."
