"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,750,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  Given my budget, I can offer you $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value you place on it and my maximum budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your effort.  $1,200,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price allows me to make a fair profit while still giving you a competitive deal. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
