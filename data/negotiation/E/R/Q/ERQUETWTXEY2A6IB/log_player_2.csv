Alice's offer is close to my maximum but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not quite comfortable with $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $120.

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but I'm still aiming lower. I'll counteroffer again, but I need to be mindful that the gap is closing."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $98. I'm willing to go up to $102, which is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:

Alice has come up quite a bit, and the difference now is only $18. It's getting risky to push further, as she might not budge much more, and I'd end up paying John's price anyway. Accepting at $102 feels like a good compromise to ensure I get the product at a reasonable discount."
