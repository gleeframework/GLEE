"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still above your ideal price. You have room to negotiate further and try to get a better deal. There's a chance you can get the product for less than $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying at the moment.  I'm ready to offer you $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $700,000. Considering our initial offer of $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $750,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a reasonable profit for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $750,000, which is a good price considering her initial offer was $800,000.  You've already rejected her offer of $800,000, and it's likely that further negotiation will just lead to more back and forth. It's in your best interest to accept this offer and get the product for a price that's still lower than what you're willing to pay from John."
