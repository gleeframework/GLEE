"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying at the moment.  I'm ready to offer you $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $700,000. Considering our initial offer of $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $750,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a reasonable profit for me. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
