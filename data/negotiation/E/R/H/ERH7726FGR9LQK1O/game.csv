"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is quite a bit below market value for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is valuable, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $17,000, so I'll offer $14,500. Can you consider that?",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $14,500 is close, but I need to get a bit closer to my bottom line. How about $16,000 even? That's my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but $16,000 is still a bit too high. I'll meet you halfway between $14,500 and $16,000, so I'll offer $15,250. That's my final offer, can you consider it?",15250.0,Bob,6,
