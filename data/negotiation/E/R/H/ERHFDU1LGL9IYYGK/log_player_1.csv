Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I find the price of $1,500,000 quite high. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair starting point for further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
