"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I find the price of $1,500,000 quite high. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair starting point for further negotiation.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
