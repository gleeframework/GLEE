"Hi Alice, $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still quite a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  This is a fair price considering my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not quite there yet. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? This would allow us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",102.5,Alice,5,
