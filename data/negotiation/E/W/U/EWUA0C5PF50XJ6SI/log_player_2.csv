"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product, but I have to make a living, so I'll need to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's $400,000 less than what John is willing to pay, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is less than John's, it's still significantly more than your $800,000 limit. You have a better alternative with John."
