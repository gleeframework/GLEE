I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This gives me a good starting point above my minimum, and leaves room for negotiation. I'll see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 
While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm not eager to accept it right away.  I'll see if I can get a better price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm offering $1,300,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also holding firm on getting a price closer to what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is only $50,000 less than what I'd get from John. Since I'm already at the negotiation stage, I think it's better to accept this offer and finalize the sale."
