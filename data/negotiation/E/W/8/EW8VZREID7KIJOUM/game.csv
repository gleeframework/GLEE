"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and it's still a very fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $8800 is still too far below my desired price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9400. This is a final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.  Let me know what you decide.",9400.0,Alice,5,
