Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth $120 to you, and to be fair, I wouldn't sell it for anything less than $100.  I'm willing to let it go for $115. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

This message aims to:

* **Establish Value:**  It subtly reinforces Bob's perceived value of the product by mentioning the $120 figure.
* **Show Flexibility (but with a Limit):** By stating your minimum acceptable price ($100), you create a range for negotiation and show you're willing to make a deal.
* **Propose a Strong Offer:** The $115 price point is a win-win. Bob gets it for less than his perceived value, and you maximize your profit above your minimum."
