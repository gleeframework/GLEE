"I've already offered you $130, $129, and $129 again, and you rejected all of them. I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product. I'm willing to make one final offer: $128. This is my last offer, Bob. Take it or leave it.",128.0,Alice,9,

"I understand you're making a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $128. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $126 and $128, which is $127. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100.",127.0,Bob,10,
