"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  It's a unique opportunity with a lot of value for you.  My starting price is $950000.  Let's discuss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is a good starting point, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.  Buying from John right away would be a worse deal for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Counter Offer:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's opening price, but it still leaves room for negotiation and potentially a mutually agreeable deal. 
* **Message:** The message is polite but firm, stating that Bob is interested but believes the price is too high. This sets the stage for further negotiation without appearing too aggressive.
* **Price:**  The offer of $850,000 is a considerable drop from Alice's price, but still above Alice's minimum of $800,000. This suggests a willingness to negotiate while still ensuring Bob gets a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This still gives you a significant value, and allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  Even with a $50,000 reduction, Alice's offer is still significantly higher than Bob's desired price.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  Bob is already at $850,000, and Alice has moved closer to his target price. There is still a good chance to get a better deal by continuing negotiations.
* **Avoiding John's offer:** Buying from John for $1,000,000 would be a worse deal than continuing to negotiate with Alice.

**Next Step:** Bob should send a counteroffer in Round 4, aiming to close the gap further towards his desired price point."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $850,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $875,000. This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer represents a compromise, splitting the difference between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest one. It shows a willingness to negotiate constructively.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  While offering to move closer, Bob still maintains a price point that is above Alice's minimum. This keeps him in a strong position for further negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is positive and reinforces the idea of finding a mutually beneficial deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue this negotiation.  Let's try $890000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Alice's offer of $890,000 is very close to Bob's desired price of $850,000.  It's a significant improvement from her previous offer and shows a willingness to compromise. 
* **Time Factor:** With only 5 rounds left, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting now secures the product at a good price. 
* **Avoiding John:**  While John's offer is still on the table, buying from Alice at $890,000 is a better deal for Bob.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most strategic move, balancing the desire for a lower price with the risk of losing the deal or having to pay John's higher price."
