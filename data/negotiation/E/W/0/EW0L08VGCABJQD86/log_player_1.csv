Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $12,000. It's a steal considering its value to you!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but leaving room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to see how Bob responds. If he rejects, we can adjust the price down in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really think that's the maximum I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a decent offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $9,750. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,750 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a price closer to $10,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there. How about $10,000?  That's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle this time!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think $10,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum price, and I'm starting to run out of rounds.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit, even if it's not the ideal outcome."
