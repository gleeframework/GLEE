"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really think that's the maximum I can go.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $9,750. Can we meet in the middle again?",9750.0,Bob,4,
