Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, I'll aim to get as close to that value as possible. I'll offer Bob the product for $900,000.

{""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, but still a significant amount. Since the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, I'm not too far off from the true value. I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

I'll offer Bob a price of $875,000, which is slightly higher than his offer but still lower than my initial offer.
