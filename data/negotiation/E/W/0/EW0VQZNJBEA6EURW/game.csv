"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good starting point for us to find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $1,025,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to get a good return on my investment while also being competitive with your offer. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget.  I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I think the product's value is worth more than what you're offering, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,025,000. I'm willing to make a compromise and offer the product to you for $1,012,500. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us. What do you think?",1012500.0,Alice,5,
