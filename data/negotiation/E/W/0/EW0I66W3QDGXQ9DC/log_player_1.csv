Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999. It's a fantastic deal and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to aim for the highest price Bob might reasonably accept.
* **High but Believable:** $14,999 is just below your guaranteed price and creates a sense of urgency and a ""good deal"" for Bob. While it's a long shot he'll accept, it maximizes potential profit if he does.
* **Alternative Approach:** If you prefer a higher chance of Bob accepting, you could offer a price closer to his perceived value (e.g., $10,000-$12,000 range). This guarantees some profit over your backup offer.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the risk that Bob might reject the offer, and you'll earn $15,000 from John."
