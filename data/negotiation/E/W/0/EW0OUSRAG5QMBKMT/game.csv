"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer you $750,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $750,000. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to go any lower.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer you $800,000, which is my absolute maximum budget.  If this is acceptable to you, I'd be happy to finalize the deal.  If not, I might need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $800,000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $815,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm not sure I'll be able to go any lower. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",815000.0,Alice,5,
