Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,900. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 11900
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still exceeding your minimum selling price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,900 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, but still nets you a significant profit.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000."
