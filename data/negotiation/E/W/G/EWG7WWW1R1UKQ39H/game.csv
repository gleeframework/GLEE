"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my own assessment of the product, I'm willing to offer $750,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I see in it.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize your valuation, the product holds significant potential beyond that price point. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise and allows both of us to benefit.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'll offer $850,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  This way, we can both come to an agreement and move forward.",850000.0,Bob,4,
