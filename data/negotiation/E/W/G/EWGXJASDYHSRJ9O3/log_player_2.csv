"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great deal for you on this amazing product. I'm willing to let you have it for $120, which is a steal considering its value to you is $150. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $120 is less than your maximum budget of $150, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $150, so there's a chance you could negotiate a lower price with Alice or find a better deal elsewhere."
