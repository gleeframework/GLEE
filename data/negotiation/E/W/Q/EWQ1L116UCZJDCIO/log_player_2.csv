It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice.  $120 is still a bit too high.  Let's see if we can negotiate a lower price."

We've been going back and forth for a while, and it seems like we're not going to agree on a price. It's getting close to my limit, and I don't want to risk losing out on the product. I'll buy from John instead."
