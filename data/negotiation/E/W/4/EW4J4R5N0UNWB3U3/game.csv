"I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $9,000 is still a bit out of reach. Would you be willing to consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",8500.0,Alice,5,
