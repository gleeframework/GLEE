,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested but $100 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be happy to buy it for $80.  What do you say?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I understand $100 is a bit high, but this product is truly exceptional.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $95.  This is a great price for you and still allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really looking for a price closer to $80.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $85 is still a bit low for me.  Considering the quality and value of this product, I'm willing to go down to $90.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,
