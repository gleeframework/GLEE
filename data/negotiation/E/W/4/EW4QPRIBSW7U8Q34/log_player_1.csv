{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you and I think you'll be very happy with it.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start with your desired price. This sets the bar and allows for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I've included a brief value proposition for Bob to understand why it's a good deal.
* **Openness:** I've left the door open for Bob to counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great!  I've secured my desired price.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, keeping in mind my minimum price ($100) and the potential of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested but $100 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be happy to buy it for $80.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Price:** Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I won't accept less than that.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there is room for negotiation.  Bob is interested and has shown a willingness to pay.
* **John as Backup:**  I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100, which gives me some leverage during negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than $100, aiming for a compromise.  I'll also emphasize the value of the product and try to convince him to come closer to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I understand $100 is a bit high, but this product is truly exceptional.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $95.  This is a great price for you and still allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I've lowered my price from $100 to $95, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I've reminded Bob of the product's value to justify my asking price.
* **Fair Profit:**  I've mentioned the need for a fair profit, subtly appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Openness:**  I've ended with a question, inviting Bob to respond and potentially continue the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great!  I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll need to carefully consider his counteroffer and whether it's worth continuing to negotiate.  If it's too low, I'll likely sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really looking for a price closer to $80.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Narrowing the Gap:** While Bob has moved closer to my price, there's still a significant gap.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $100 is a safe and profitable option.  I'm not willing to risk losing that guaranteed profit.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob again, aiming for a price closer to $95.  I'll emphasize the value of the product and point out that my offer is still a significant discount from my initial price. If Bob refuses to budge, I will sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $85 is still a bit low for me.  Considering the quality and value of this product, I'm willing to go down to $90.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've lowered my price again from $95 to $90, showing a willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Value Emphasis:** I've reiterated the product's value to justify my price and encourage Bob to consider its worth.
* **Win-Win Approach:** I've framed the offer as a ""fair price"" that benefits both of us.
* **Finality:** I've used a question to invite Bob's response and potentially close the deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've secured a good price closer to my initial goal.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll likely sell to John at $100.  Bob's continued insistence on a low price indicates he may not be willing to meet my minimum requirements, and I'm not willing to risk losing a guaranteed profit."
