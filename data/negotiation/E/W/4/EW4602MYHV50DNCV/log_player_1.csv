Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. If that works for you, we can close this deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear it's going to be a long negotiation to get even close to $1,150,000. John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000 which is already a great deal for me. It's not worth the time and risk to continue negotiating with Bob."
