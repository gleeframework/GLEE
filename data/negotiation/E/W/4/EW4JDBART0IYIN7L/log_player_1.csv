"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's becoming clear he's unlikely to reach our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. We have a guaranteed offer from John at that price. It's better to take the sure thing than risk getting stuck in a protracted negotiation with Bob."
