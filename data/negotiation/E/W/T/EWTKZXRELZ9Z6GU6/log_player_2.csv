"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

It's the first round and Alice's offer is above my budget. I should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $72.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still a bit away from a price I'm fully comfortable with. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit more."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand Alice, but I was hoping to keep it closer to $70. Would you be willing to meet me there?"",
