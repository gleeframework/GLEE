"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to you ($9,500 vs. $8,000).**  It is worth trying to negotiate a lower price.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save money.**
* **Buying from John at this point would be less advantageous as you can likely get a better deal with Alice.**"

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than the product's value to you ($9,000 vs. $8,000).**  You can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer, potentially bringing the price closer to your target.**
* **Buying from John would be more expensive than this current offer, making it less attractive.**"
