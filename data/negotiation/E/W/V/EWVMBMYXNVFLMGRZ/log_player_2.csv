The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is offering it for $120. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

This offer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's significantly lower than Alice's price but still above your maximum value. It shows you're serious about buying the product but are willing to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer of $100 is still higher than my maximum value of $80. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed price from John."
