"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

The product is worth $120 to Alice, and she's offering it at $140. You can definitely get a better deal. Let's try to counteroffer and see if we can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above her value of the product, giving her some room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $135 is a good compromise. It's within your budget, and it's likely the best deal you'll get from Alice. Buying from John for $150 is not a good option."
