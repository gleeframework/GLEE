"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll gain.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $750,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers at $825,000. This price reflects the value of the product and ensures a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,5,
