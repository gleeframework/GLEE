"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $800,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given the value of this product to me, I'd like to offer you $700,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After reviewing the market and the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value you'll get from it. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit more than I can justify at this time.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $700,000. This price reflects the product's value to me and allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's see if we can agree on this.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. Considering the product's value to you and the market conditions, I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This is a reasonable compromise that should meet your needs. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility.  $850,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  This would be a fair price that benefits both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $800,000 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession.
