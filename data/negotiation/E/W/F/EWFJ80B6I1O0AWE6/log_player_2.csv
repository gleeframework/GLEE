# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($9,500 < $12,000).** 
* **You save money compared to buying from John ($12,000 - $9,500 = $2,500 saved).**

Even though you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, accepting her offer guarantees a purchase within your budget and saves you a significant amount of money."
