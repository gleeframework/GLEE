Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Offering $1,000,000 is still significantly higher than the $800,000 Bob values the product at. This gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum value:** It's well below your minimum price of $1,200,000.  This means you have room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **It's a strong opening:** This price shows you are serious about selling the product, but it also gives Bob room to counteroffer.

This strategy is designed to maximize your chances of getting a good price while still maintaining the option of selling to John if the negotiations with Bob don't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to accept because it's better than nothing, it's not a good deal for me.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, or if that fails, I can sell to John for a significantly higher amount.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my minimum value but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what the product is worth. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying above my minimum:** $850,000 is still above my minimum value of $1,200,000.
* **Compromising:** This counteroffer demonstrates willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  It's still below my initial offer, suggesting I'm open to further discussion.

This strategy aims to get closer to a price that is acceptable to both of us, without sacrificing too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still a significant distance. I'm not willing to drop below $800,000, which would be a significant loss for me.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $800,000. I'll try to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us, but I will not compromise below my bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to go down to $800,000. This is my final offer, as it's the lowest I can go and still make this deal worthwhile.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This message emphasizes that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or reject. 
* **Lowest Possible:**  $800,000 is the absolute lowest I can go while still maintaining a reasonable profit.
* **Direct Approach:**  The message is direct and clear, leaving no room for ambiguity.

This counteroffer is a firm stance while still acknowledging Bob's perspective.  It gives Bob a clear decision point and increases the likelihood of a deal while minimizing my financial risk."
