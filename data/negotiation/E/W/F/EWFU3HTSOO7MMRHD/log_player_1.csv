Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $15,000
* **Bob's maximum acceptable price:** $8,000
* **Starting point:** I'm starting with a price of $13,000, which is significantly lower than my minimum but still higher than Bob's maximum.
* **Negotiation strategy:** I'm aiming to get a price as close to my minimum as possible.  I believe Bob might be willing to negotiate upwards, especially if he really wants the product.
* **Plan B:** John is a backup option, which allows me to walk away from negotiations with Bob if they don't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:** $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could accept Bob's offer, I'm not willing to lose $6,000.  There's a chance that I can negotiate a better price with Bob or, if not, I have the option to sell to John for my minimum price.
* **Next steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Previous offer:** Bob's offer of $9,000 was significantly lower than my minimum.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** I'm lowering my price from $13,000 to $11,000, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Finding middle ground:** This offer is still higher than Bob's offer, but it moves closer to a potential middle ground.
* **Plan B:** I can still sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a drastically low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:** $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiation.
* **Guaranteed outcome:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 
* **Time is money:** Continued negotiation with Bob could drag on, and John is a guaranteed sale."
