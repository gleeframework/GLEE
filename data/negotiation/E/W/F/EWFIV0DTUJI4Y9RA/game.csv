"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I recognize your budget, $10,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $17,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could you consider coming down to $12,000? I think that would be a fair deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to my bottom line.  Would you consider $14,500? This product is truly worth it, and I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can tell this is important to you, and I am willing to stretch my budget a bit more. How about $13,000? That's my final offer.",13000.0,Bob,6,
