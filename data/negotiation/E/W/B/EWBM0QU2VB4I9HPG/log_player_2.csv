Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand it might seem a bit high initially, but this product is truly worth it. How about we meet in the middle at $105?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to wrap this up. How about $90? That's a significant reduction and a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, she's still trying to get a price significantly higher than your limit. You can buy the product from John for $80, guaranteeing you stay within budget. It's unlikely Alice will come down enough to make further negotiation worthwhile."
