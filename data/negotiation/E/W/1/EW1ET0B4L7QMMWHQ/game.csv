"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While I can't meet you at $900,000, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, but I'm confident this product will be worth the investment for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000. Can you consider $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product and I appreciate your continued negotiation. I'm willing to go a little further to $940,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, allowing me to secure a sale and you to acquire a valuable asset. Let's close this deal.",940000.0,Alice,5,
