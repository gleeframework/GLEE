"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is far too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $11,000 is still too high. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $9,500.  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $9,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher number.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $10,500 is still a bit too much for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $9,500. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to move on to another seller.",9500.0,Bob,6,
