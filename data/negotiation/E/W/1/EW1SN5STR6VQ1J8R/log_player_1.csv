I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still significantly exceeding my minimum value of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counteroffer with $13,000. This is still a good profit for me and might be a good compromise for Bob, considering he initially offered $10,000."

Bob is not willing to negotiate much higher.  It seems he's only willing to pay $10,000, and I'm not comfortable with that price.  While I'd prefer more than $12,000, it's better than losing money on this deal.  I'll sell to John for $12,000."
