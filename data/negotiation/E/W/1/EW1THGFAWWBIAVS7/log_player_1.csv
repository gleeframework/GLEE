Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000 and we have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, we start high to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving negotiation room:**  A starting price of $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying comfortably above John's offer.
* **Polite and professional tone:**  Maintaining a positive and respectful tone encourages open communication and increases the chances of a successful negotiation. 

**Goal:** Ideally, we want Bob to accept this offer or a subsequent counteroffer that remains significantly above $1,500,000. If negotiations fail, we can always fall back on John's guaranteed purchase."
