Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible without going below my minimum ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high but below my absolute minimum allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate. Even if he counters, there's a chance to settle above my guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Create Urgency:** By highlighting the value and asking for his thoughts, I subtly nudge Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

This strategy aims for the best-case scenario â€“ selling to Bob at a high price. However, it keeps the safety net of John's offer, ensuring I don't lose out."
