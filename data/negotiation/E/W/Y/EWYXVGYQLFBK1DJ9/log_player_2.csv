"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a concession to make it happen. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:** While Alice's offer is still higher than the product's worth to her ($8,000), it's significantly lower than Bob's alternative price from John ($12,000). 
* **Bob saves money:** Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $2,500 compared to buying from John."
