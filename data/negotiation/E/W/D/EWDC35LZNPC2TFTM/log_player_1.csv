Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, so she starts negotiations significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer allows for some negotiation downward while still remaining well above Bob's $800,000 valuation.
* **Justifying the Price:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing specifics, aiming to pique Bob's interest and justify the high price.

**Strategy:**

Alice's strategy is to anchor the negotiation at a high point, hoping that even with some negotiation, she can secure a price significantly higher than Bob's initial perception of the product's worth. If Bob rejects the offer, she has the security of John's guaranteed purchase."
