"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price. I would like to propose an offer of $1500000 for the product.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the product's minimum value to me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to see some movement from your end. I'll meet you at $1650000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll meet you at $1675000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to another buyer.",1675000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower than I already have. I've made concessions, and I believe the product's value is worth more than what you're offering. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at $1700000. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1700000.0,Alice,9,
