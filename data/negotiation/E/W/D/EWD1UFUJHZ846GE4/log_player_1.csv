Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $11,500, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $11,500, which is slightly above my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a better starting point.
* **Positive Message:** I'm using a friendly and positive message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's value and its potential benefits for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $10500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I still believe I can get a higher price. The product is worth significantly more to Bob ($12,000), and I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal.
* **Proceeding to the next round:** I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my desired amount before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  The product is truly worth more, and I'm confident it'll be a great investment for you. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm offering a counter-offer of $11,000, which is a compromise but still higher than Bob's offer. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and its potential for him. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my initial price, but still aiming for a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I'm still not comfortable paying $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10750. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's offer:** While Bob's offer is still lower than what I initially wanted, it is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and  $10,750 is a significant increase from John's offer. 
* **Time is a factor:** We are already in Round 4, and there's a chance Bob might not budge further.  
* **Potential for future deals:** By accepting Bob's offer, I might open the door for future collaborations or potential sales with him in the future."
