"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings!",125.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit more. I'm offering the product to you for $115. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm really trying to make this work, but $115 is still too high for me. I'm happy to pay $95, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm getting.  Let's make this happen.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to make this work, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering the product to you for $105.
