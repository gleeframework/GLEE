Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a strong fallback position, giving you leverage in the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
