Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,275,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, his offer is still too low. I believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1,275,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still thinking $1,250,000 is a more realistic price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,275,000, but I'd rather not go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm losing valuable time and negotiation rounds. I'll take John's offer and sell the product for $1,200,000. It's a guaranteed deal and a reasonable price."
