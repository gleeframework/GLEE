While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,225,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** I'm still securing a $225,000 profit over my minimum. 
* **Time Factor:**  Dragging negotiations out longer risks Bob walking away.  
* **Bird in Hand:**  I have a solid offer on the table, whereas continued negotiation doesn't guarantee a better outcome."
