"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially even more than my asking price.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,100,000 is considerably below what I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle â€“ would you consider $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on this product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  How about we settle at $1,175,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me halfway. How about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're both serious about making this deal happen.  To show I'm willing to compromise, I can offer $1,200,000.  That's my best and final offer.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
