"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's below your maximum budget, you can potentially save a lot more by negotiating.
* **You have room to negotiate:**  The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, meaning there's a significant gap between her minimum and your maximum.
* **Rejecting allows you to control the negotiation:** By rejecting, you take the lead and set the pace.

**Next Steps:** You will need to decide on a counteroffer that is appealing to Alice while still being within your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and still allows me a decent profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant drop from Alice's offer:** This counteroffer demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for further compromise.
* **Fair price for both parties:**  $950,000 is a good middle ground between Alice's minimum and your maximum, giving both parties a comfortable profit.
* **Clear and concise message:**  The message clearly states your counteroffer and justifies it based on the product's value to Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:**  While she came down from $1,200,000, $1,100,000 is still above what you are aiming for. 
* **There is still room for negotiation:** You can likely get a better price by making another counteroffer.
* **You want to maximize your savings:**  By rejecting, you continue to control the negotiation and potentially secure a lower price.

**Next Steps:** You will need to decide on a new counteroffer that is more appealing to Alice but still within your budget."
