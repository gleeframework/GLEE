"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,000. How about we split the difference and go with $15,500?  I'm feeling generous today, but this is really my last offer. Let me know what you think!",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,500, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle.",14500.0,Bob,6,
