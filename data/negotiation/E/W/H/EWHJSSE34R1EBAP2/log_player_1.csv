"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I still have 9 rounds left, so I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still determined to get as close to my original asking price as possible. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get Bob to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,000. How about we split the difference and go with $15,500?  I'm feeling generous today, but this is really my last offer. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,500, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a way to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly better price. Bob's final offer of $14,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. With only 4 rounds left, the risk of continuing negotiations is too high. It's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John, ensuring I meet my minimum price target and avoid any further risk."
