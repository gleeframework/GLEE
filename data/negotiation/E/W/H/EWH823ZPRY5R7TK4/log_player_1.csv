"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a good starting point.  I'm offering a price that's significantly lower than Bob's valuation but still higher than my minimum. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while also showing that I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the deal, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm aiming to get the best price, I'm also trying to avoid a complete breakdown of the negotiation. I will counter with a slightly lower offer than my initial price in the next round.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's try to reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I would like to counterpropose a price of $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'll counter with a slightly lower price again to see if we can close the gap. I want to see if I can push Bob further before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best price, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to go down to $10,000, but that's my final offer. If you're serious about buying this product, I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offers. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counteroffer at $9,750 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and I'm starting to run out of time. It's better to accept his offer and get $9,750 than risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $8,000."
