"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$20,000 is way above Bob's budget.  It's best to reject and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high.  Bob should continue negotiating to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. Let's split the difference and go with $11,000.  That would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to consider your proposal, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up too much more. I'm willing to come down another $500, but I think $10500 is the lowest I can go. This is already a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still a bit too high.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if Alice will go lower.  There's a good chance she will since she's already come down quite a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still hoping to get the price down a bit more. How about $9,500? This is a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10000. This is already a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $9500, so I'm offering it to you for $9750. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting close to his budget limit, but there's still a little room to negotiate.  He can try to get Alice down just a bit further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer and I'm getting closer to where I want to be. I'm willing to go up to $9,600. If you're serious about selling, this is the final price I can offer."", ""product_price"": 9600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to consider your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $9600. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9750 and $9600, so I'm offering it to you for $9675. This is my final compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,675. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,675
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob is getting very close to his budget limit, and while $9,675 is a great deal, it's still above his preferred maximum. It's better to stick to his initial budget and go with John's offer, as he's guaranteed to get the product for $8,000."
