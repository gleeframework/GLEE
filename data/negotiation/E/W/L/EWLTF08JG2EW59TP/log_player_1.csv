"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $1,450,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 but also leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially capture a larger portion of the value difference. 

**Rationale:**

* **Maximize Potential Earnings:** This initial offer aims to secure a price close to the product's worth to Bob, potentially netting me a good profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** By not starting at the highest possible price, I signal a willingness to negotiate and create space for Bob to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **Strategic Advantage:** If Bob accepts the offer, I win. If Bob rejects, I can still use the remaining rounds to negotiate further.
* **Back-Up Plan:**  Knowing I have John as a backup option at $1,200,000 gives me confidence to pursue a higher price with Bob."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer.  I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob and potentially secure a larger profit.

**Rationale:**

* **Room for Improvement:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm confident I can push for a higher number in the remaining rounds. 
* **Maximize Profit Potential:** Rejecting allows me to maintain leverage and potentially secure a price closer to my desired $1,450,000. 
* **Avoid Settling:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean leaving $100,000 on the table, a significant amount.
* **Strategic Advantage:**  I can use the remaining rounds to test Bob's commitment and see if he's willing to meet me closer to my initial offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to Round 3 and send Bob a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price from $1,450,000 to $1,400,000. This counteroffer is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. 

**Rationale:**

* **Maintain Leverage:**  I'm not giving in too much, but showing a willingness to meet Bob halfway. 
* **Test Bob's Resolve:**  This counteroffer will gauge whether Bob is truly interested in closing the deal or just trying to get the lowest possible price. 
* **Balance Profit and Progress:**  This offer keeps the possibility of a higher profit while moving the negotiations closer to an agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good outcome. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and determine if it's worth accepting or pushing further. 
* I'll also continue to keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1390000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price to $1,390,000. This shows I'm flexible and willing to meet Bob halfway, but I still believe the product is worth more than his latest offer.

**Rationale:**

* **Finding Common Ground:**  I'm making a small concession, signaling that I'm genuinely interested in reaching an agreement.
* **Maintaining Value:**  This counteroffer is close to my previous offer, ensuring I don't lose too much value. 
* **Pressure on Bob:** This places the onus on Bob to either accept or make a more substantial counteroffer.
* **Strategic Advantage:**  I'm aiming to close the gap and potentially reach a deal before the negotiation runs out of rounds.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a good outcome.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to carefully evaluate the situation. If his counteroffer is significantly lower, I may need to consider accepting John's offer to avoid losing too much time and money."
