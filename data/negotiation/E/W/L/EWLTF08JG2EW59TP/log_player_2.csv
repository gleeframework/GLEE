"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,450,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate. It's also a price that is still more than the product is worth to Alice, leaving room for further negotiation if she rejects the offer. This strategy aims to find a price point where both parties can agree without Bob exceeding his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $1,400,000 is still a bit high. There's still room for negotiation to try and reach a price closer to $1,350,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her last offer and Bob's previous counteroffer.  It shows Bob's willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to his target. This tactic aims to find a middle ground and potentially reach a deal in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,390,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,390,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to Bob's desired price range.  It's only $20,000 higher than his last counteroffer.  Continuing to negotiate could result in further back-and-forth, risking reaching the 10-round limit and being forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a reasonable price within his budget."
