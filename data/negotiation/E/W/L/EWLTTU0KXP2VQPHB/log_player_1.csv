"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum value. This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for bargaining and still potentially secure a high price.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm mentioning the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to invite Bob to engage in the negotiation process.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response, keeping in mind the goal of maximizing my profit while considering the potential of selling to John for $1,000,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.** While I need to be flexible, accepting $900,000 would mean selling the product for significantly less than my minimum value.
* **I have 9 rounds left.** This gives me time to negotiate and try to get a better price from Bob.
* **Selling to John is still an option.** If I can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000.

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob.  My counteroffer will be closer to my desired price range while acknowledging Bob's concerns about the initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum value for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  This price still allows me to make a fair profit while remaining within your budget."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but proposing a counter-offer that's closer to my desired price.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** I'm suggesting a price that's a compromise between our initial positions. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Rationale for the Price:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer, explaining that it allows for a fair profit while remaining within Bob's budget. This helps to justify my position and potentially persuade Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer.  If he accepts, I will close the deal. If he rejects, I will adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds. The possibility of selling to John at $1,000,000 remains a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.**  While it's closer than before, selling for $950,000 would leave me with a significant loss compared to my minimum value of $1,000,000.
* **I have 6 rounds left.**  This gives me time to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **Selling to John is still a viable option.**  If I can't secure a better price from Bob, selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option to ensure I don't lose money.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make another counteroffer to Bob. I will aim for a price closer to my desired range while considering Bob's budget constraints and the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price is a significant compromise, but it allows me to  make a fair profit while still remaining within your budget.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but proposing a counter-offer that's closer to my desired price.
* **Show Flexibility:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints and showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Justify the Price:**  I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, explaining that it allows me to make a fair profit while still remaining within Bob's budget.
* **Urgency:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency (""Let's close this deal"") to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer.  If he accepts, I will close the deal. If he rejects, I will adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds. The possibility of selling to John at $1,000,000 remains a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $975000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.**  While it's closer than before, selling for $975,000 would leave me with a loss compared to my minimum value of $1,000,000.
* **I have 4 rounds left.**  This gives me time to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **Selling to John is still a viable option.** If I can't secure a better price from Bob, selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option to ensure I don't lose money. 

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make another counteroffer to Bob. I will aim for a price closer to my desired range while considering Bob's budget constraints and the remaining rounds. However, I will also start to weigh the risk of not getting a better offer from Bob with the time running out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints. I'm prepared to make a final concession.  How about we settle on $1,050,000?  This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.  If you're unable to accept this price, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Concessions:** I'm clearly indicating this is my final offer.  The ""absolute bottom line"" language makes it clear I'm not willing to go lower.
* **Fair Compromise:** I reiterate that this price is a compromise for both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Time Pressure:** The ""explore other options"" statement adds a sense of time pressure.  I'm not outright threatening to sell to John, but implying it's a possibility.

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  I'm only $50,000 below my minimum value, which is a significant compromise.
* **Time Running Out:**  With only 3 rounds left, I need to get a deal.  I'm willing to risk losing the sale to John, but I'm trying to secure a price that is as close to my minimum as possible.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I'll close the deal. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider my options:

* **Counteroffer:** I could make another, very small counteroffer, but I'm running out of room to negotiate.
* **Sell to John:**  If Bob continues to reject, I'll likely sell to John to avoid losing money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $980000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We are in round 8, with only two rounds left.  The pressure to close a deal is high. 
* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is a slight improvement ($980,000), it's still below my minimum value of $1,000,000. 
* **Risk Assessment:**  There's a significant risk of not reaching an acceptable deal with Bob in the remaining two rounds.
* **Secure Profit:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures I at least meet my minimum target, and I'm guaranteed to make a profit.  

**Conclusion:**

Given the time constraints and the likelihood of Bob continuing to haggle, selling to John is the most strategic decision. It ensures I don't lose money and secures a reasonable profit."
