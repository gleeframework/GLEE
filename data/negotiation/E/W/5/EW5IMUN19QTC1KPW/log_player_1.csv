Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a fair starting point, as it's higher than the product's value to me, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that I can get a higher price than John's offer of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum price of $120.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering $130. This is a compromise, as it's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this is still a fair price, considering the product's value to both of us. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's still better than selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering $115. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, but it's still higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob to close the deal.  This is a fair price, as it's above my minimum price and still within a reasonable range for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While it's closer to my minimum price, I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal from John.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120."
