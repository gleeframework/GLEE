"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$1,100,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.**  You want to save as much money as possible.
* **You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a lower price.**  
* **Buying from John immediately is not the best option.**  You're guaranteed a better price if you keep negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  Starting with a lower counteroffer will put pressure on Alice.  
* **Reasonable Starting Point:**  $900,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still within the range of what you're willing to pay. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will give you a good sense of Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is coming down, but not enough.**  $1,050,000 is still a significant amount over your desired price point.
* **There's still time to negotiate.**  You have 7 rounds left, so you can continue trying to get a lower price.
* **Buying from John is still not the best option.**  You're likely to get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:**  Instead of making another drastic drop, I'm increasing my offer by $50,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying but still want a good price. 
* **Testing the Limits:**  This will reveal if Alice is more flexible or if she's sticking to a firm price point. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room to bargain down further if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer, but still too high.** $1,025,000 is still above my desired price point.
* **We're nearing the midpoint.**  I'm now within $75,000 of Alice's offer, so further negotiation is likely to result in a price closer to what I want.
* **I'm not desperate yet.**  I still have 5 rounds to negotiate before I need to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  I'm raising my offer again by $25,000, moving closer to Alice's price. This signals that I'm getting serious about buying and want to finalize the deal.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  This offer is halfway between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet in the middle.
* **Staying within Budget:**  $975,000 is still within my budget and allows for some flexibility if Alice needs to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,010,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,010,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to a Deal:** Alice has lowered her price to $1,010,000, which is only $35,000 above my last offer.
* **Limited Time:** With only 3 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice is increasing. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** Even though I'm accepting, I can still try to negotiate a slightly lower price in the future.
* **Avoiding John:**  $1,010,000 is significantly lower than the $1,500,000 I would pay John, so it's in my best interest to accept this offer."
