"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. There's a chance you could negotiate a better price with Alice by rejecting her initial offer."
