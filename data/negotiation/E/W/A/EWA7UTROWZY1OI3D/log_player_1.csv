Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $11,500 gives me a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:** The price is below Bob's perceived value ($12,000), increasing the likelihood of him accepting or making a counteroffer.
* **Safety net:**  I have John as a backup buyer, allowing me to walk away if the negotiation with Bob fails to reach a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's above my minimum of $10,000, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.
* **Potential for counteroffers:** I believe I can push for a higher price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **Safety net:** I still have the option to sell to John if the negotiation with Bob fails to yield a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  It's still a good value for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I've lowered my price from $11,500 to $11,000, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Still profitable:**  $11,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Appealing to value:**  I'm emphasizing the value Bob will get by highlighting the product's worth. 
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and encourages continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think $10,500 is a fair price for me. Can you meet me in the middle at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,750 is just $750 below my desired price, and only $250 above my absolute minimum.
* **Risk of losing a deal:** If I reject this offer, it's possible Bob will walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $10,000.
* **Time factor:**  Continuing the negotiation might take time and effort, while accepting this offer secures a sale and a profit.

While I would prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer minimizes risk and ensures a reasonable profit within a reasonable timeframe."
