Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by:

* **Being reasonable:**  $9,500 is above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:**  Mentioning the product's condition emphasizes its worth.
* **Leaving the ball in Bob's court:** Asking for his opinion invites him to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting allows you to counter and potentially get closer to your target price of $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is tempting, I'm aiming for a bit higher. Let's split the difference: $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  The counteroffer splits the difference between the initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Reiterate value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's worth reinforces the reason for the higher price.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The question ""What do you say?"" keeps the conversation open and encourages Bob to counter again if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you at $8,800. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:** $8,800 is just $200 below your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While not ideal, this offer is better than selling to John for $8,000.
* **Avoiding risk of deadlock:**  Further negotiation could risk Bob backing out entirely, making this offer a safer option."
