Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000).** This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **It's below the product's perceived value to Bob ($15,000).** This incentivizes him to accept the offer. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
