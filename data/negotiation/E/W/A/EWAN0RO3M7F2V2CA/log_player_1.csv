Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. Please let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John, maximizing profit means aiming for a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than John's offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 positions the offer as a significant but potentially justifiable premium for Bob. It allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to bargain.
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses confident language (""exclusive opportunity"", ""worthwhile investment"") to subtly influence Bob's perception of the product's value. 
 
This strategy attempts to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
