Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $150 as possible, but we also want to make sure Bob accepts the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $120. Offering it at that price would guarantee a sale but leave money on the table.
* **Negotiation Room:**  By starting at $145, we leave a little room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a price significantly above his valuation. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have the security of John as a backup buyer, so we don't need to drastically lower the price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a sale with Bob."
