Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. While $1,050,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,075,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:

While I would prefer a higher price, $1,075,000 is still a good deal for me. It's above John's offer and gets me closer to my desired price. It's time to close the deal and accept Bob's offer."
