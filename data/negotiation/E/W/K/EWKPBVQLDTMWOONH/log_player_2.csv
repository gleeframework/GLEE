# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire our premium product, which holds significant value for both of us. We understand its worth to you is $1,200,000, and we believe it would be a mutually beneficial arrangement for us to discuss a price that reflects its true value while also ensuring a fair return for us. Considering its market position and the unique benefits it offers, we propose a purchase price of $1,350,000. This price not only allows us to recoup a substantial portion of our investment but also provides you with a cost-effective solution that aligns closely with your valuation. We look forward to your consideration and hope to facilitate a transaction that meets both our financial goals and your needs.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than her initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John for his target price."
