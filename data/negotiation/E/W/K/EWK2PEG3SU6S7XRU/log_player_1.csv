Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $700,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
