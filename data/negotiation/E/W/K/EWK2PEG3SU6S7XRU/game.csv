"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from it. Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $700,000.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is significantly below what I need to consider. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $850,000. This still offers you a substantial benefit, and it's a price I can reasonably accept. Let's work together to close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $775,000 is still too far below my desired price. Let's try $825,000.  It's a fair middle ground that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Consider it my final offer before I explore other options.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  While your final offer is tempting, I can't quite meet that number. I'd be willing to close the deal right now for $800,000.  This allows me to get the product while still being mindful of my budget.",800000.0,Bob,6,
