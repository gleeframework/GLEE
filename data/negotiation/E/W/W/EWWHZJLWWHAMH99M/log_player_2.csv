"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is $2,000 over Bob's maximum price. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $15,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $15,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still $1,000 more than Bob is willing to pay. There's still room to negotiate. It's worth trying to get a better deal by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about $15,750?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and allows for some room for us to both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 15750}
