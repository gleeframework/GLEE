"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $15,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",15500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $15,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about $15,750?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and allows for some room for us to both be happy with the deal.",15750.0,Bob,4,
