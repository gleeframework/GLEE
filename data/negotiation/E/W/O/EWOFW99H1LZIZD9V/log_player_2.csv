"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is above his budget, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between $18,000 and $15,000. How about $16,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $16,500 is closer to his budget, it's still above his desired price point.  He can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $15,500 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $15,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $16,000 is getting closer to his ideal price, he's still within his budget and has a few more rounds to negotiate. He can likely push for a lower price, especially since Alice has already indicated a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $16,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $15,500. Would you be willing to settle on $15,750? This would be a good middle ground and allow us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 15750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $15,750. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $16,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,250 is closer to his desired price, he has a few more rounds to negotiate and can still try to push for a lower price. It's important to remember that he has a fallback option of buying from John for $15,000.  

He should aim for a counteroffer that is closer to his target price, ideally below $16,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  I'm still a bit above my target with $16,250.  I'm willing to meet you at $16,000, which is a fair price for both of us and will help us finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're really close now, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000, but I'd like to add a small premium for the value I bring to the table. How about $16,200? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. 

Here's why:

* **Limited time:** This is Round 9, meaning Bob is close to running out of negotiation rounds.
* **Small gains:** The price difference between Alice's offer and John's price is only $200.  The potential for a better deal is low.
* **Risk:**  If Bob rejects Alice's offer and continues to negotiate, there's no guarantee he'll get a better price. He could end up with a worse deal or no deal at all.

Buying from John provides certainty and saves Bob time and the risk of a worse outcome."
