,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between $18,000 and $15,000. How about $16,500?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $15,500 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $15,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $16,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $15,500. Would you be willing to settle on $15,750? This would be a good middle ground and allow us both to walk away satisfied.",15750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $15,750. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $16,250?",16250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  I'm still a bit above my target with $16,250.  I'm willing to meet you at $16,000, which is a fair price for both of us and will help us finally close this deal.",16000.0,Bob,8,

"I think we're really close now, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000, but I'd like to add a small premium for the value I bring to the table. How about $16,200?",16200.0,Alice,9,
