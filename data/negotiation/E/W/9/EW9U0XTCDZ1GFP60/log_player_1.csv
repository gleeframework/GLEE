Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute lowest point.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's appealing to Bob while still maximizing your profit. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can afford to start high.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** This offer starts closer to your guaranteed price, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value to justify the high price.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  This offer gives Bob the impression that you might be willing to come down slightly, potentially leading to a faster deal. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might consider starting slightly lower (e.g., $1,350,000).
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If you need to sell quickly, a slightly lower offer might be more attractive. 

**Remember:**  The goal is to find that sweet spot where Bob feels he's getting a good deal while you still secure a price significantly above your minimum."
