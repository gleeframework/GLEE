"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business.  I'm asking for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This price still leaves a good profit margin for you and allows me to acquire the product at a price that works for my budget. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. While I want to reach an agreement, I need to ensure I receive a fair return on the product.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This still gives you a significant advantage in terms of value, and I believe it's a price that we can both be happy with.  Let's work together to make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me, and it leaves a solid profit margin for you. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
