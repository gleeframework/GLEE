"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business.  I'm asking for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. $1,000,000 is still too high for him. He can likely get a better price by counteroffering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. While I want to reach an agreement, I need to ensure I receive a fair return on the product.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This still gives you a significant advantage in terms of value, and I believe it's a price that we can both be happy with.  Let's work together to make this happen.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $950,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still more than Bob is comfortable with. He can likely get a better price by counteroffering again."
