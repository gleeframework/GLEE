"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $80 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a bit less. Would you be interested in paying $100 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While you value the product at $120, Alice is offering it for $100. This is a good deal for you.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer means paying more.** If you reject Alice's offer, you'll have to pay John $120, which is more than you need to pay."
