Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce that the price is justified.
* **Alternative Option:**  Hinting that you have other options (""listing it publicly"") creates a subtle sense of urgency for Bob to act.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open for further discussion, allowing Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high. 

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net, aiming slightly higher with Bob initially maximizes your potential profit."
