Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this represents a fair offer considering the immense benefits it offers."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm excited about its potential. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than our minimum and his perceived value. While accepting would secure a profit, it's too early to concede. We have room to negotiate and aim for a price closer to $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  However, the value this product brings to the table is immense.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,200,000 is too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're aiming to close the gap quickly while still staying above our minimum.  This counter-offer shows flexibility but also emphasizes the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the right price. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I think $1,150,000 is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but we're still a significant $150,000 away from our last counteroffer.  It's time to show Bob we're serious and willing to walk away if necessary. John's offer, while lower, is starting to look more appealing as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential for you. I'm willing to accept $1,250,000 as my final offer. This is a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it's more than fair given the value you'll gain."",
 ""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We've reached a critical point. We're holding firm at $1,250,000, signaling it's our walk-away point. This conveys seriousness while still offering a small concession. It's a calculated risk, but it might be enough to close the deal and avoid potentially losing out on a higher sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,250,000 is the right price. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I think $1,100,000 is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly unwilling to meet our price point. His offer of $1,100,000 is a significant $150,000 below our last counteroffer and shows he's not moving closer to our valuation. It's becoming increasingly unlikely that he'll agree to a price that's significantly higher.  

At this point, the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential reward. Accepting John's offer of $1,000,000 guarantees us a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further haggling with Bob. It's time to secure a good deal and move on."
