"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Buying from Alice for $125 is the best option.** You value the product at $150 and can get it for $125, saving $25 compared to buying from John. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer is not ideal.**  It means you'd have to buy from John for $150, which is more expensive than Alice's offer."
