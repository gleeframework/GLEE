"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is far too expensive for Bob's budget. It's best to reject and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

Bob should start by offering the absolute maximum he's willing to pay. This sets the starting point for the negotiation and shows Alice that Bob is serious about saving money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget. It's best to keep negotiating and try to get closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

Bob should increase his offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that he's willing to compromise, but still wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price. There are still rounds left, and he can always buy from John if he needs to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

Bob is inching closer to his goal.  He's raising his offer again, showing flexibility but staying within his acceptable range. If Alice still refuses, Bob has to consider the risk of running out of rounds and being forced to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but Bob still has some room to negotiate. It's risky to accept now, as there are still rounds left. He could get a better deal, or risk being stuck buying from John.  Bob should try one more counteroffer to see if he can get closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Bob is making a final push here. He's increasing his offer again, but this is likely his absolute limit. If Alice rejects, he's likely going to have to go with John. This puts the pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the deal entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum. With only one round left, it's too risky to continue negotiating. Bob is likely to lose out on the product if he rejects again. Therefore, it's best to secure the product from John at his guaranteed price, even though it's not the absolute best deal."
