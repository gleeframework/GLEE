"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $140?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $140 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $155? Let's close this deal.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $155 is still a bit more than I want to pay.  I'm happy to pay $150, which is what I'd pay John if we can't reach a deal. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,4,
