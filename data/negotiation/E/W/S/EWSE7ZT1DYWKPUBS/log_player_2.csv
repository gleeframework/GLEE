"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and features, I'm asking for $14,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's way above his budget. He should counteroffer and try to get a better price before considering buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget. While negotiating further is an option, buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his maximum price point. It's a safer bet than risking further negotiation with Alice."
