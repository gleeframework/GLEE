"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be of great benefit to your business. I'm asking for $1,000,000 for it. This price reflects the product's true value and its potential to generate significant returns for you. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's discuss!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $850,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to my business.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which reflects a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm confident this price is fair and allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's continue to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is closer, but still a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $875,000?  I feel this is a fair compromise and allows us to move forward.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects the value you'll gain from this product.  Let's make this deal happen.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been great to work with, and I appreciate the concessions we've both made to find a price that works.  To bridge the gap, I can offer $885,000. I'm hoping this demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",885000.0,Bob,6,
