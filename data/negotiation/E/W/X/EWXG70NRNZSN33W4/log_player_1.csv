Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $850,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which reflects a significant discount from my initial offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is closer, but still a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $875,000?  I feel this is a fair compromise and allows us to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting, I'm still holding out for a higher price.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects the value you'll gain from this product.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been great to work with, and I appreciate the concessions we've both made to find a price that works.  To bridge the gap, I can offer $885,000. I'm hoping this demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's very close and getting the deal done now is more important than holding out for a few more thousand dollars.  I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether and having to sell to John for a much lower price."
