You have three options:

Bob should reject the offer. While it's tempting, it's still above his budget. He can do better."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget, and he's already rejected a lower counter-offer. It's unlikely Alice will come down to his desired price. John offers a guaranteed price that fits within Bob's budget, making him the better choice."
