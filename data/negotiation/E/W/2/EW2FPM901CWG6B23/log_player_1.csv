Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my needs and offering the product. While I appreciate your proposal, my budget allows me to only consider offers within the range of $750,000 to $800,000. I believe this is a fair range given the current market value and my financial situation. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
