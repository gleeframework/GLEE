"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $900,000 to make this worthwhile. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you have to get a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 still isn't quite where I need to be.  Let's try $850,000. This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
