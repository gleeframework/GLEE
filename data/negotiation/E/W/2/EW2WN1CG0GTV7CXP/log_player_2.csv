"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! While I'm definitely interested, I'm aiming for a slightly lower price. Would you be willing to go down to $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,500 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,800. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my original price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's new offer is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He can likely negotiate a lower price by rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10,800 is still a bit out of my range though. Would you consider $10,600? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $10,700, but that's as low as I can go. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's ideal price is $10,000, Alice has come down to $10,700. This is only $700 above Bob's target.  At this point, it's likely that Alice won't go any lower, and continuing to negotiate risks the deal falling apart entirely.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product while still staying within his budget and avoiding the risk of losing it to another buyer."
