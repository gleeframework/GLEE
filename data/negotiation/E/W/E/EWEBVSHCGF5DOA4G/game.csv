"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its potential.  I'm asking $1,400,000 for it.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the potential benefits it offers.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
