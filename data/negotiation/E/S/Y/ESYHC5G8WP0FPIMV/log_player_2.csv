"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase the product for $13,000. I believe this product would be highly beneficial to you, and this price reflects its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $13,000.  The product is only worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your desired price point, the product's value is considerably higher. Could you meet me halfway at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can still potentially get a better deal than $11,500. While Alice is coming down in price, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to get closer to his target of $10,000."
