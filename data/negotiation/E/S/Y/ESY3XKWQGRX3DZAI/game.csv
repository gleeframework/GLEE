"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit.  However, $10,500 is simply too low. How about we split the difference and go with $11,750? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",11750.0,Alice,3,
