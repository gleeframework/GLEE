"I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $18000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you, and it's a great deal considering what I could get from other buyers.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I place on the product.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. It's a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $14000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. I can offer the product to you for $14500. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",14500.0,Alice,5,
