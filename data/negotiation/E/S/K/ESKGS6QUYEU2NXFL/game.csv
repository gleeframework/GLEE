"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant.  Would you consider $1,000,000? That would make the decision much easier for me.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're getting close to a decision, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
