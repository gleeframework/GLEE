Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Avoid Greed:**  While I could try for a price closer to $15,000, it increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. I'm guaranteed $12,000 from John, so securing a $2,000 profit is a good outcome."
