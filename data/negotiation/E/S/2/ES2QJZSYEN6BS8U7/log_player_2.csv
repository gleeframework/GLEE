"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her minimum value, and it's significantly lower than my maximum budget. There's a lot of room for negotiation, so it's worth exploring potential counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer you $700,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than her minimum value. This will likely force Alice to reconsider her position and potentially lead to a quicker negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a step in the right direction, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I'm confident we can reach a price closer to my initial counteroffer, and I'm willing to keep negotiating to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle again.  How about we settle on $775,000? This is a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 775000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer ($700,000) and Alice's latest offer ($850,000). It demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price lower than Alice's last offer. This should keep the negotiation moving forward and hopefully lead to a quick agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer it to you for $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than I'm willing to pay. While it's a slight adjustment, I'm confident I can get a better price with further negotiation.  It's also important to note that I'm still within the first half of the negotiation rounds, so there's plenty of time to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to find a final compromise. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me while also acknowledging your need to make a profit. "", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant move towards Alice's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  I'm aiming for a quick agreement at this point, as it's close to her minimum acceptable price and allows for a significant saving for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment and offer it to you for $825,000. I believe this is the best price we can agree on, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has repeated her offer of $825,000.  While this is a bit higher than my ideal price, I have reached the midpoint of the negotiation.  At this point, it's more likely that the price will stay the same or go higher. It's also getting closer to my maximum budget for the product.  While I'd like to negotiate further, it's more prudent to accept the offer now and secure the product than risk missing out on the deal altogether."
