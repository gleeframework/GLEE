"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's self-interest:**  I'm emphasizing the value to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price gives me room to lower the price if necessary, while still maximizing my profit. 
* **Focus on a quick deal:** I'm aiming to close the deal in the first few rounds, as it's more efficient than prolonged negotiation."

```

**Explanation:**

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go that low.  $1,100,000 is my best price considering the value of this product.  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering with a slightly lower price:** I'm moving down from my initial offer, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Emphasizing the value to Bob:**  I'm reminding him of the value of the product to him, making my offer appear more appealing.
* **Creating urgency:**  Using phrases like ""Let's close this deal"" subtly implies a time constraint and encourages a quicker decision.
* **Keeping the door open for negotiation:** While I'm making a counteroffer, I'm still open to further negotiation if Bob is willing to come up in price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still not high enough:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still significantly lower than what I would like to get for the product. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 6 rounds left and I'm confident that I can push for a better price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John at $1,500,000 is a safe option, but I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. The potential reward of a higher price outweighs the risk of losing a bit of time."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the deal:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable value, and I have only 4 rounds left.
* **Minimizing risk:** While I could try to get a higher price, there's a risk that Bob might reject my counteroffer or that I might not be able to reach a deal before my time limit runs out. 
* **Securing a good price:**  $1,060,000 is still a good profit for me, and I don't want to risk losing a deal for a small difference in price.
* **Moving on:**  I can always try to find a better deal in the future, but it's important to secure a solid offer when it's available."
