Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking $90 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer. If he rejects, you can always lower the price slightly in a counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is close to your minimum, you can potentially get a bit more.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a slightly higher price, potentially getting closer to your desired $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit lower than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50? "", ""product_price"": 87.50}
