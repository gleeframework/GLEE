"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach $800,000 quickly enough.  It's time to cut our losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
