"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
