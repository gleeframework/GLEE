"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than what the product is worth to Bob but still lower than my minimum desired price. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm framing the offer in a positive way, highlighting the value for Bob and leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Reserve:** I'm keeping in mind my ability to walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000. This provides leverage and a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $950,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Deal:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum desired price, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. He's shown willingness to move closer to my initial offer, indicating room for further negotiation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting his offer keeps me in control of the negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to my target price.
* **Assessing Risk:** Selling to John would guarantee me my minimum desired price, but it would also forgo any potential for a higher sale price through negotiation with Bob. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can secure a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a fair price considering the value this product brings to you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the value the product brings to Bob to justify the price and strengthen my position.
* **Call to Action:** I'm urging Bob to close the deal, creating a sense of urgency.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price slightly closer to Bob's offer, I'm hoping to entice him to accept, but I'm still maintaining a position that's profitable for me. I'm also strategically using positive language to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to increase my offer to $960,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer is now only $15,000 below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000.  
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob might become more resistant or even walk away from the negotiation entirely. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We're already in round 4, and I need to consider the possibility that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a lower price in the end. 

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Accepting the offer minimizes my risk and secures a good price.** While it's not my ideal price, it's still a profitable sale. 
* **Selling to John guarantees my minimum desired price, but it also risks losing the potential for a higher price with Bob.**

In this situation, accepting Bob's offer is the most prudent choice. It ensures a sale while also minimizing the risk of losing the deal altogether."
