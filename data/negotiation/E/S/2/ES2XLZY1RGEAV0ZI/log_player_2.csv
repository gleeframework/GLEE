"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a product that is truly worth a significant amount to you, and I believe this price is a fair compromise between our valuations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is less than the price from John, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to offer $750,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and counteroffer at $850,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $900,000 to $850,000, which is closer to Bob's counteroffer of $750,000. This means there's potential for further negotiation, but the risk of rejection from Alice increases.  It's now more advantageous for Bob to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price that's still significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000."
