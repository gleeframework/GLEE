"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth while still being fair to both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've indicated for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I still have 9 rounds left, and I'm not desperate. I want to see if I can push Bob higher, or at least gauge his true budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is still a significant discount from my initial asking price, and a good deal for you.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  Considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Even though I'm starting to feel the pressure, I'm not desperate enough to accept it yet.  I have another 6 rounds to try and get closer to my goal. I'll see if I can convince Bob to go higher in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, at $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your budget.  Let's finalize this deal. "", ""product_price"": 950000}
