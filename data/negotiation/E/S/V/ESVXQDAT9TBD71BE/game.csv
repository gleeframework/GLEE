"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth while still being fair to both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've indicated for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is still a significant discount from my initial asking price, and a good deal for you.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  Considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, at $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your budget.  Let's finalize this deal. ",950000.0,Alice,5,
