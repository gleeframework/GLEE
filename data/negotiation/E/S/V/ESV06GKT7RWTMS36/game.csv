"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $700,000. Would that price point be feasible for you?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
