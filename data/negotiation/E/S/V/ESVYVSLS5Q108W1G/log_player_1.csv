"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I consider the minimum acceptable, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to encourage him to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking for something within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $120 is far below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob or from John.  I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a great price for a product you'll find very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm glad we're getting closer. I would like to propose a price of $140 for the product. I hope this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $140 is still too far below my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $155? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would ensure you get a great product."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in adjusting your offer. I am willing to pay $150 for the product, which is the highest I can afford. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation. Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure if I can get more from him. However, John is also offering $150.  Since I'm already at the 6th round, I'm worried that if I reject Bob's offer, he might walk away and I might not have enough time to negotiate further. It's a risky choice, but I'll accept Bob's offer."
