"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is considerably below what I can accept. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a fair compromise given the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
