{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It also signals that I'm serious about selling and open to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$6,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but not that much. I'll counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
