"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a good starting point considering the product is worth $15,000 to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is a decent offer, I believe I can get a higher price from Bob.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for something closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,500. It's a compromise, meeting Bob halfway, and hopefully, he'll accept it.  This keeps the negotiation moving forward without risking losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a bit more.  I'm rejecting his offer and will counter again.  There are still several rounds left, and I'm confident I can close the deal at a price closer to my initial goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,000. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, but it keeps us moving towards a deal while still being above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While this offer is getting very close to my minimum, I still think I can get a bit more. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating. I'm only two rounds away from having to sell to John, so I need to push for a slightly better price if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12900}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,900. This is a very small compromise, but it shows Bob I'm serious about getting a deal done.  If he rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

There's only one round left, and Bob isn't budging. I'm too close to my minimum acceptable price and am running out of time. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
