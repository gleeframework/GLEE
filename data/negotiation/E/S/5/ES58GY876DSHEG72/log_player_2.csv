"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's within my budget, I can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling point. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,050,000 is still too high. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's try to close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1,000,000. This is a final offer from me.  Let's see if we can finally agree on a price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $1,000,000, I'm still confident I can negotiate a lower price. I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer. If Alice doesn't budge, I'll likely buy from John, but I want to exhaust all options with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still slightly more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $985,000 for the product.  This is a very close to your offer and a fair price, given our positions. I believe this could be our final offer. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 985000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $985,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $995,000.  This is a very small difference from your offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement now. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $995,000, which is only $10,000 away from my last counteroffer.  This is a very small difference and likely the best deal I'm going to get from Alice.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's getting risky.  If Alice rejects my next offer, I might end up buying from John at a much higher price.  It's time to take the deal and save a significant amount of money compared to John's offer."
