"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low.  Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $850,000? This would still be a great price for you, and it would allow me to reach a fair price for myself.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to a price point I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and it would still allow you to purchase a product that's worth significantly more to you.  Let's make this happen!",825000.0,Alice,5,
