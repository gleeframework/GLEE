"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secures a good price.  I'll be prepared to counteroffer if he rejects, but I'll also be monitoring the situation to see if I can secure a deal with John if it looks like I won't get a favorable outcome with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's tempting to take $9,500, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my goal. I'll counteroffer and continue to see if I can negotiate a better price.  I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option if things don't work out with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial $13,000 but staying firm above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and meet me halfway.  This offer is still more favorable for me than selling to John. I'll keep monitoring the situation and be ready to adjust my strategy if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I am running out of time, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum. I will try one more counteroffer to see if I can bridge the gap. If it fails, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm lowering the price again but only by a small margin. I'm hoping Bob will recognize that I'm serious about getting a deal done and will accept this offer. If he rejects it, I'll be forced to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. He's refusing to budge from his price, and I'm running out of time. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Selling to John for $12,000 is a better deal for me, and I'm confident I can secure a deal with him quickly.  I'll be prepared to negotiate a higher price with future customers."
