"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. It's a good starting point as it's above my minimum price and leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price to $90. This is still above my minimum and shows good faith in the negotiation. I hope Bob will find this price acceptable and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  Even though it's closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept a price that low unless it's the final round. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 88} 
```

I'm going to lower my price to $88. This is a significant compromise, but I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about closing this deal and accept this offer. We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $84
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, we're nearing the end of the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the sale. $84 is still a good price, and it's better than selling to John for $80."
