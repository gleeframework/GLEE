"I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I think $10,500 is getting closer, but I'd like to get it down to $9,000. That's my final offer. I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me there.",9000.0,Bob,4,
