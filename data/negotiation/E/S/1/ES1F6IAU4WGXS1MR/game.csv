"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we bring it down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While I'm motivated to find an agreement, $900,000 undervalues the product significantly.  Would you consider $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Could we settle on $975,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I understand your perspective on the price, but I'm confident this product offers you even more value than that. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,012,500?  This feels like a strong point to land.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
