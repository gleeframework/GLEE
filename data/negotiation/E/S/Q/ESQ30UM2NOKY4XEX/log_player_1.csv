Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product ahead of other interested buyers. Given its value and the demand, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  Let me know if you'd like to proceed."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While we know John offers a safety net at $15,000, aiming higher with Bob initially could lead to a better outcome.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $20,000 leaves space for potential negotiation.  Bob might counter-offer, and we can always come down closer to $15,000 if needed.
* **Create a Sense of Value and Urgency:**  By highlighting the product's value and demand, and positioning this as a ""first-mover"" opportunity for Bob, we increase the perceived value.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, the potential for a higher profit by starting negotiations above our guaranteed price with John makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
