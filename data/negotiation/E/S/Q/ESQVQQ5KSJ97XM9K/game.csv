"Bob, I understand your position, but $14000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'd find it to be a great value.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $14500. This is a fair price considering my budget, and it's closer to your desired value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14500.0,Bob,4,
