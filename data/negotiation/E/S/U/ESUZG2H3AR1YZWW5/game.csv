"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own something truly unique. With that being said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $800000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your offer of $950000. Considering the product's value to me is $1200000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging my own value for it. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I respect your valuation of the product, I am unable to meet your current offer of $1050000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000. This is the highest amount I can reasonably offer based on my budget and the value I perceive in the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
