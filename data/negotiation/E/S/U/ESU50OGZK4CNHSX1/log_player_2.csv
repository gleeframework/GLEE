"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. You know you can get the product for the same price from John. By rejecting, you can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant discount is a good strategy to signal your interest in the product while also indicating that you're willing to negotiate.  $100 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for further negotiation while still being significantly lower than Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is within my budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer.  While I could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice might refuse and I'd end up paying the full $120 to John.  Accepting the offer is the most sensible choice at this point."
