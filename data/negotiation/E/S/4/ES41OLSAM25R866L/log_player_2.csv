{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is way above Bob's budget of $12,000.  Therefore, it's best to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer at $10,000. This is a bold move, but it signals to Alice that Bob is serious about getting a lower price.  It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down from her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $13,000 is still over Bob's budget.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try and get closer to his target price.  It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower, as Bob might be able to secure a better deal than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his budget.  This counteroffer of $11,500 is a good middle ground. It shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but still wants a good deal.  It's a reasonable compromise that might be acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $12,500 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still a bit high.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob might be able to get a slightly better deal.  Rejecting the offer keeps the door open for a more favorable price and allows Bob to explore his options further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now at his limit. This counteroffer of $12,000 is Bob's final offer and matches his budget from John. It's a fair price that reflects the value Bob places on the product.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can confidently switch to John for a guaranteed deal."
