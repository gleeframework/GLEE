Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob counters.  
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies the product is worth the higher price. 

**Important Note:** While I have a guaranteed sale, pushing Bob too high could make him lose interest entirely. This offer balances risk and potential reward."
