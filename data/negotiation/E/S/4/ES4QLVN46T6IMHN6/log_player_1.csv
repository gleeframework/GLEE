Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your portfolio. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John offers $800,000, Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This presents an opportunity to negotiate a higher price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 allows for potential negotiation downwards while still remaining significantly above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong but Not Greedy:**  This price point reflects the product's value to Bob while demonstrating a willingness to make a deal.  Starting too high (close to $1,000,000) might discourage him."
