"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider it. After reevaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you and my initial offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
