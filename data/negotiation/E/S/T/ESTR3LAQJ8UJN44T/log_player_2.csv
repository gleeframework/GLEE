Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $79. It's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll love it.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is consistently coming down and is now at $79.  While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk she'll become firmer in her position, and I'd end up paying $100 to John anyway.  $79 is a good deal, and it's time to secure the purchase."
