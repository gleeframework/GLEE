"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I see you're serious about this purchase. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,000 less than John's price.** This makes it a better deal for Bob.
* **Further negotiation may lead to a lower price, but it risks delaying the purchase and potentially losing the deal entirely.** Alice is already willing to meet Bob halfway, so it's a good point to accept the offer."
