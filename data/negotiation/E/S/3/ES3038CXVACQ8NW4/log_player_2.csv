"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really value.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  He knows the product is worth $8,000 to her, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $10,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  How about $9,000?  I'm really interested in this product and think we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 9000}
