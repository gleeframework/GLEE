"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $60.",60.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is well below what I need to sell. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Is that something you can work with?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $60 is low, Alice, but $110 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's the highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,4,
