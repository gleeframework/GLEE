Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than what Bob values the product at, but it's also significantly less than what it's worth to me. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially make a profit. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and positive, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy is designed to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a successful negotiation.  By offering a price that's still beneficial to Bob, I increase the likelihood of him accepting.  However, I'm also leaving room to negotiate further if necessary.  I'm also keeping the option of selling to John open, as a backup plan if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $600,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  Rejecting this offer allows me to counter with a higher price, hopefully leading to a more favorable outcome.

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiating Power:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my willingness to hold out for a better price. This strengthens my position in the negotiation.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** The next counteroffer will aim to find a price that's more acceptable to both of us. 
* **Backup Option:**  The option to sell to John remains a safety net, ensuring I won't be forced to settle for an overly low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in my product. While $600,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $800,000?  That's still a great price for you, considering the value of this product. Let's find a compromise we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$800,000:** This counteroffer represents a middle ground between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $600,000.  
* **Message:**  The message is still friendly and emphasizes finding a compromise, encouraging Bob to see the value in this price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Compromise:** By offering a price closer to Bob's offer, I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I highlight the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that $800,000 is still a good deal.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for further discussion, suggesting that I'm willing to compromise even further."
