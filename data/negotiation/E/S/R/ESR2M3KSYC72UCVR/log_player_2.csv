Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is too far below my asking price. Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still gives you a significant profit, and allows us to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $750,000 is still not enough to cover my costs.  Let's split the difference and go with $900,000.  This gives you a good deal, and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $900,000. Buying from John at $800,000 saves us money and guarantees we get the product."
