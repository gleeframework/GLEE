"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at a price that's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob to make him more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This offer allows for several rounds of counteroffers before reaching my minimum price, while still potentially closing the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and even below his estimated value of the product ($800,000). 
* **Negotiation is possible:** I still have multiple rounds left, and Bob is clearly interested in the product.  I can likely push for a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is the backup:**  If negotiations continue to fail, selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed profit, but I'm not ready to give up on a potentially higher deal with Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is too far below my asking price. Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still gives you a significant profit, and allows us to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a higher price:**  While I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, I'm still aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price and  leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Focus on Bob's gain:** I'm highlighting the potential profit Bob can make by accepting my counteroffer, appealing to his self-interest.
* **Show flexibility:** By lowering my price, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still remaining firm on the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While closer to my minimum, $750,000 is still significantly below my acceptable price and likely leaves me with less profit than I could get from John.
* **More negotiation is possible:**  We have several rounds left, and Bob is clearly willing to negotiate. I can likely push for a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John remains the fallback:** While I'm aiming for a better deal with Bob, selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option if negotiations break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $750,000 is still not enough to cover my costs.  Let's split the difference and go with $900,000.  This gives you a good deal, and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a higher price:** While I'm willing to come down further, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Show compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by moving towards Bob's offer, but not conceding too much. 
* **Highlight the win-win:** I'm emphasizing the benefits for both of us, making the deal seem more attractive.
* **Encourage a quick decision:**  By focusing on the potential for a quick agreement, I hope to motivate Bob to accept my offer."
