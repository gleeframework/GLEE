"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Could you do $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
