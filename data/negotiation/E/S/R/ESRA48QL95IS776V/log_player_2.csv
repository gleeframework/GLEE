"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $130, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

You can likely get a better price from Alice. You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice's offer is too high.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to counter and potentially get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you thinking of me. I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $110? "", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has come down from $130 to $120, and you're willing to pay up to $150.  It's a good deal for you, and you'll save $30 compared to buying from John."
