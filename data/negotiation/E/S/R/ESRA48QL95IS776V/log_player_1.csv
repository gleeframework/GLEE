Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you thinking of me. I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $110?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
