"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit out of my budget. How about $150? That's a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $160 is still a bit higher than your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $155. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
