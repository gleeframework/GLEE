"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and we're willing to start negotiations at $85. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, it's worth exploring if you can get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm looking to spend closer to $75.  Would you be willing to consider that price? "", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $75 is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer of $85. This shows that I am serious about getting a good deal, while still remaining within the price range I'm comfortable with. It's a reasonable starting point for further negotiations, as there's still room to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your budget and am willing to meet you halfway. I propose a price of $80 for the product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $80 is better than her initial offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $75. It's worth exploring if we can bridge the gap further before I consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $77.50?  I'm eager to make a deal, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 77.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $77.50 is a compromise between my previous offer of $75 and Alice's offer of $80. It shows a willingness to meet her halfway, while still remaining within my budget.  This offer is a good starting point for the next round of negotiation, and it signals that I'm serious about closing the deal."
