"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $9,500. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's lower than John's price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Bob ($8,000). 
* **Potential for negotiation:**  There's room for Bob to negotiate a lower price. 
* **No immediate urgency:** Bob has the option to buy from John, so there's no pressure to accept Alice's first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This price is fair considering its value, and it allows us both to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice's offer of $9,000 is a compromise, and it's a good middle ground between Bob's previous offer and Alice's original asking price.
* **Value for Bob:**  $9,000 is still within Bob's budget, and it's a better deal than buying from John for $10,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject and he'll be forced to buy from John.

It's a reasonable compromise that saves Bob money compared to John's offer."
