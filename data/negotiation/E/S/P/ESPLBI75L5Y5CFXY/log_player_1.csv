Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $100. I believe it offers great value at this price."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation or allows you to appear accommodating if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer will help gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, great! If he rejects or tries to negotiate, you still have the safety net of John.
* **Justification:** While not strictly necessary, mentioning ""great value"" aims to frame the price positively. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to potentially negotiate with Bob if he counters."
