"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a steal at this price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you highlighting its unique qualities.  While I'm interested, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $85?  That's my absolute top limit for this product.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $110 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $95. If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you at $105. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a fair price for this unique product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
