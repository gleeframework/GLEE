"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $18000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $14000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
