"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. Let's start with a price of $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product,  $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $900,000 for the product. Can we discuss further?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $900,000 is still beyond my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $875,000 for the product. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $875,000 is still a bit too low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get at least $920,000 for the product. This is my final offer for this round, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. Let's see if we can close the deal.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm getting closer to your price, but $920,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $890,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",890000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get as close to my minimum price as possible. I can offer you $915,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",915000.0,Alice,7,
