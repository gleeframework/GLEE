"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85? It's still a good price for you, and I'm sure we can find a deal that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  That's still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $120 to you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $95 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would be a great deal for me.",90.0,Bob,4,
