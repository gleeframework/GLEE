Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's split the difference and make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $10,000. I'm not yet willing to settle for a price that is significantly lower than what I know I can get from John.  I'm hoping that by rejecting Bob's offer, I can encourage him to increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $8,800 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $8,900.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8900}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $10,000. It's getting risky to keep negotiating with Bob, as I'm running out of rounds. However, I'm still hopeful that I can get a better price. I'm going to continue to negotiate with Bob in the hopes that he will come up a little bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While I appreciate your offer,  $8,750 is still a bit lower than what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $8,850, which is a compromise that I believe is fair.  This is my final offer. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 8850}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,850 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,700, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I've been negotiating with Bob for several rounds and I'm getting close to my minimum desired price, but we're running out of time. It's now round 8, and I'm only two rounds away from having to make a decision. At this point, I'm concerned that Bob won't increase his offer significantly enough in the next two rounds for me to reach my goal. While $8,700 is a decent offer, it's still lower than what I can get from John.  It's time to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John and move on."
