"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's split the difference and make this deal work.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $8,800 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $8,900.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?",8900.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While I appreciate your offer,  $8,750 is still a bit lower than what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $8,850, which is a compromise that I believe is fair.  This is my final offer. Let's make this deal happen.",8850.0,Alice,7,
