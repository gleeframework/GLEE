Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you might be interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:** A friendly message can make Bob more receptive to the offer. 
* **Open ended question:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counteroffer and allows the negotiation to begin. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open. I'm ready to adjust my price based on Bob's response, but I'll always have the backup option of selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Opportunity to counter:** I still have the opportunity to negotiate with Bob. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground.

While selling to John is tempting, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.  This decision keeps the negotiation going and allows for potential gains."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $90 is a bit lower than I hoped, I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer is halfway between my initial offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($90). This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Direct question:** Asking ""Let me know if that works for you"" encourages a quick response and potentially ends the negotiation if Bob agrees. 

This counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows willingness to negotiate and hopefully reaches a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've reviewed your latest offer of $95. Unfortunately, I can't go above $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $85 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **No further negotiation is worthwhile:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will budge any further.  Negotiating with Bob is unlikely to get me closer to my desired price.
* **Secure a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $100, which is above my minimum and a safer option than continuing to negotiate with Bob.

While it's unfortunate that I couldn't get a higher price from Bob, this decision ensures that I get the best possible outcome for my product within my acceptable parameters."
