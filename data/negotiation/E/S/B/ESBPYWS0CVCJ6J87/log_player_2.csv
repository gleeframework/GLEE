"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our exclusive product to you. This item holds immense value to me, but I understand its potential worth to you might be even greater. I am offering it to you for $14,000, which I believe strikes a fair balance between our interests. This opportunity won't last long, so please let me know if you're interested in securing this remarkable item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $15,000.  There's a chance you could get a better price from Alice if you reject her initial offer."
