"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, Bob can likely do better.  He has a clear target of saving as much money as possible, and there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let me know if you're open to this price."", ""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:** The counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's desire to save money. However, it's not so low that it's likely to be immediately rejected, keeping the negotiation open.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Bob frames his offer by highlighting the product's value to *him*, suggesting he's willing to pay a fair price but not a premium.
* **Open to Discussion:** Bob's message ends with a question, inviting Alice to continue the negotiation rather than simply making a demand."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save as much as possible, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into acquiring it. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Savings:**  Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, offering a price $150,000 lower than her original asking price. This represents a substantial saving for Bob.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  While Bob could try for a lower price, there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further.  Continuing the negotiation carries the risk that Alice might become less flexible or even walk away from the deal entirely.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Buying from John for $1,000,000 represents a significantly higher cost.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a lower price while minimizing risk."
