"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $12,000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your offer, but I am still aiming for a price closer to $12,000. Could you possibly lower the price to that amount? I believe it would be a fair compromise for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
