Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  $14,000 is still within Bob's range, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you still make a decent profit.

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $12,000. Would you consider reducing the price to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I want to try and get closer to my desired price.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $12,000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** A $13,000 offer is halfway between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise and makes it more likely he'll accept.
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate that this is still a good deal for him, emphasizing that he's getting a valuable product at a reasonable price. 
* **Staying above minimum:**  $13,000 is still above my minimum, ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your offer, but I am still aiming for a price closer to $12,000. Could you possibly lower the price to that amount? I believe it would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking to his $12,000 offer, which is too low for me.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  I've already lowered my price significantly and I'm not comfortable going any lower. At this point, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  

Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my desired profit and avoids the potential frustration of further negotiations with Bob."
