"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a significant discount.  While I'm confident I can find another buyer willing to pay full price, I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is a discount from the product's full value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can secure the product from John for a significantly lower price."
