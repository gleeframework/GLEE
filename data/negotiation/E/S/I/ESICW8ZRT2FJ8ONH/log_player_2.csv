"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  The next step is to make a counteroffer to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're offering, my budget for this product is a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $9,000?  It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Bob should buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice's offer of $9,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget. At this point, it's clear that Alice is unwilling to go lower, making John the better option."
