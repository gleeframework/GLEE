"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,350,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than the minimum I'm willing to accept. This allows for some room to negotiate and hopefully encourages Bob to make a counteroffer, giving me a chance to close the deal at a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product to me is quite high, but I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about we aim for $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is still a good amount of money, it's too low for me, especially considering I can sell to John for $1,200,000 at any time. I'll counteroffer Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000.  This still represents a great value for you, and it allows us to close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see that we're not quite meeting in the middle there, Alice. Considering the value I place on this product, I'd like to propose a price of $1,225,000. This is still below your original asking price, but closer to what I believe the product is worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and is higher than what I can get from John.  It's a good deal, and I'm confident I won't get a better offer in the remaining rounds."
