"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
That's a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $60.,60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $60 is far below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $175.  This is a significant discount from my original offer and a fair price for a product of this quality.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $175 is a good price. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.,90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is a significant compromise. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a reasonable price. What do you say?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to a deal, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell for $115. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to get a great product without breaking the bank. Let's close this deal!",115.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $115. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.",95.0,Bob,8,
