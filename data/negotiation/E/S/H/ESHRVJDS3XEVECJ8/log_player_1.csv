Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get closer to the value I think the product is worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I can likely get closer to my desired price of $1,400,000 through further negotiation."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from where I'd like to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1250000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I think the product is worth to me.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a higher price with another counteroffer. I want to see if we can reach a compromise closer to my initial asking price."

Bob's offer:

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $1,280,000 is close enough to my minimum, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better result. It's time to close the deal."
