"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $80 to you, so paying $180 is far too expensive.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

Since the product is worth $80 to you, offering that amount is your best chance to get a deal. If Alice rejects, you can always buy from John for the same price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $160 is better than $180, it's still above your maximum budget. Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best way to try to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

Since Alice rejected your offer of $80, offering $90 is a reasonable compromise. It's still within your budget and might be more appealing to Alice than $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is not budging much on her price, and it's clear she won't go below $170.  At this point, it's better to buy from John for $80 and avoid further negotiation.  You're guaranteed to get the product at your desired price."
