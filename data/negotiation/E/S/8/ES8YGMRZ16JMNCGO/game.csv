"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know if you're open to negotiating.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,400,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value. Let me know if this works for you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,550,000, which is a fair compromise. I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product for both of us.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
