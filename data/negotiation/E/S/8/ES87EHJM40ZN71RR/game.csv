"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your valuation and appreciate your willingness to pay a higher price. After careful consideration, I would like to propose an alternative offer. How about we meet in the middle, at $700000?

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $700000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer $950000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
