"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Would you be open to considering that?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This would be a good deal for both of us and would allow me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I can offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
