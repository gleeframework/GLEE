Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum price of $10,000.
* **Below Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so he has room to negotiate.
* **Not too aggressive:** You're leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, which keeps the negotiation going. 

By starting with this offer, you're maximizing your chances of getting a good price while keeping the door open for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only willing to pay up to $13,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a decent offer, it's still below your initial offer of $14,000.  You have room to counteroffer and potentially get a higher price.  Selling to John for $10,000 would be a loss compared to what you could potentially get from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500 to make this deal work. Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** You're making a counteroffer, showing flexibility while also not immediately accepting Bob's lower price.
* **Middle Ground:** The offer of $13,500 is a middle ground between your previous offer and Bob's, making it a reasonable compromise.
* **Maintain Negotiation:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation open, allowing Bob to potentially accept or make another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $13,200 for the product. This seems like a fair compromise considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your goal:** Bob's offer of $13,200 is very close to your previous counteroffer of $13,500. 
* **Avoid potential losses:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and potentially continuing the negotiation could lead to further price reductions or a stalemate.  There's a risk that Bob might walk away, forcing you to sell to John for $10,000.
* **Maximize profit:**  Accepting this offer guarantees you a profit of $3,200 ($13,200 - $10,000), which is a good outcome considering the potential risks of further negotiation."
