"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $100 is a bit high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to significantly lower the price while still leaving room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it.  It also conveys a sense of interest, which might make Alice more inclined to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I can do $92, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but there's still room for negotiation. Let's try one more time to get closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we split the difference and call it $88?"",
""product_price"": 88
}
``` 

This keeps the negotiation moving by suggesting a compromise right between our previous offers.  It shows I'm willing to move closer to her price, but still want a decent deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm getting a bit closer to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly not going to budge much further.  While $95 isn't ideal, it's a reasonable compromise and saves me $25 compared to John's offer. It's time to accept and get the product."
