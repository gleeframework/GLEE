"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low, but we're early in the negotiation.  I'm willing to see if we can reach a compromise by counter-offering."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still represents a good deal for you, considering the value of the product to you. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the fact that I'm willing to close the deal now. Let's not let this opportunity slip away. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and it's worth closing the deal now to avoid further negotiations."
