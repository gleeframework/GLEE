"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still represents a good deal for you, considering the value of the product to you. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the fact that I'm willing to close the deal now. Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
