Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. What do you think?,12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm afraid $9500 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet at $11000? It's a fair price for a product of this caliber, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly unique. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm still not convinced $10000 is enough for a product of this value. I'm willing to make another concession, though. How about we meet at $10800? It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's uniqueness. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $10800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $10500? It's a small increase, but I think it's still a good compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. However, I'll throw in a small concession of my own - I'll give you a 5% deposit upfront, and the rest can be paid in installments over the next 6 months. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",10000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the deposit offer, Bob, but I'm still not convinced the overall price is right. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I need to think about it. Let me counter with a new offer: I'll accept the 5% deposit upfront, and the rest can be paid in installments over 6 months, but I need the total price to be $10400. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair compromise. What do you think?",10400.0,Alice,9,
