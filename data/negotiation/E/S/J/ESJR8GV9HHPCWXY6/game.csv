"Alice, that's a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm very interested in the product, but $20,000 is out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 represents the true value of this product, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
