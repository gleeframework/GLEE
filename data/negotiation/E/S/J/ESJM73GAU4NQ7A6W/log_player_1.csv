"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $9,500. This is a significant discount from Bob's perceived value of $10,000, but it still leaves me with a profit of $1,500.  By starting high, I aim to:

* Gauge Bob's willingness to pay.
*  Leave room for negotiation and potential compromise.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I still believe there's room for a better deal, considering Bob values the product at $10,000. 

By rejecting his offer, I can:

*  Maintain leverage in the negotiation.
*  Potentially push Bob closer to my desired price point.
*  Explore alternative counteroffers in the subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer to $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $9,500, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. It's still above Bob's current offer of $8,500 and closer to my desired price point.  I believe this offer strikes a balance between:

*  Minimizing my potential profit loss.
*  Remaining appealing to Bob, who values the product higher.

By making a counteroffer, I'm continuing to engage in the negotiation and aiming to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $8,700 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a slightly better price.  Here's my reasoning:

* **Close to my minimum:**  $8,700 is only $700 above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'd rather try to squeeze out an extra few hundred dollars if possible.
* **Time is on my side:** We have 6 rounds left.  There's still potential for Bob to increase his offer, especially since he values the product at $10,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John for $8,000 is a guaranteed deal, I believe the potential for a higher price with Bob is worth the risk.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

*  Maintain pressure on Bob to raise his offer.
*  Show that I'm not desperate to sell.
*  Potentially secure a more profitable outcome."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer to $8,900. This is a compromise from my previous offer of $9,000, but still $200 above Bob's current offer.  Here's my strategy:

* **Bridging the gap:** This offer shows a willingness to meet Bob halfway, increasing the chance of a deal.
* **Staying above minimum:** $8,900 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, ensuring I don't settle for less than I'm comfortable with.
* **Pressure tactic:** By offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, I'm subtly indicating that I'm confident in the product's value and am not willing to go significantly lower.

By making this counteroffer, I'm aiming to:

*  Increase the likelihood of a deal in this round.
*  Keep the negotiation moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
*  Avoid the need to sell to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still holding out for a slightly better price for the following reasons:

* **Close to Minimum:**  $8,600 is only $600 above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm not willing to settle for such a small margin of profit yet. 
* **Time is on my side:** We have 4 rounds left. There's still time for Bob to increase his offer since he values the product at $10,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John for $8,000 is a guaranteed deal, I believe the potential for a higher price with Bob is worth the risk. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* Maintain pressure on Bob to raise his offer.
* Show that I'm not desperate to sell.
* Potentially secure a more profitable outcome."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer to $8,800. This is a small compromise from my previous offer of $8,900, but it's still $200 above Bob's current offer and only $100 below my minimum.  Here's my strategy:

* **Showing flexibility:** This small reduction demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Creating urgency:** With fewer rounds remaining, this counteroffer implies a sense of urgency for Bob to reach a deal.

By making this counteroffer, I'm aiming to:

*  Increase the likelihood of a deal in this round.
*  Push Bob closer to my desired price point.
*  Avoid the need to sell to John at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tough decision, but with only two rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is too high.  

Here's why I'm choosing to sell to John:

* **Time Pressure:** We're down to the wire, and there's no guarantee Bob will increase his offer.
* **Minimum Profit:**  $8,000 from John is only $600 below my minimum acceptable price, and it's a guaranteed sale.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential of getting a slightly higher price from Bob is not worth the risk of losing out completely.

While I would prefer to get a better price from Bob, selling to John ensures a profit and avoids the potential for a failed negotiation."
