Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **John as a safety net:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not afraid to push for a better price with Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not offering the full $15,000, as this might make Bob immediately reject the offer. 

This strategy allows me to start the negotiation strong, but also leaves room for potential concessions if Bob makes a reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $11,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my $15,000 floor. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price by counteroffering. 
* **John as a safety net:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not feeling pressured to accept Bob's offer.

**Next steps:**  I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my ideal, but still lower than my floor price, to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I value the product highly, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This still represents a great deal for you, and it's the best I can offer at this time. Let's try to reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($11,000). This shows willingness to compromise without going below my minimum.
* **Emphasizing the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to accept.
* **Setting a clear limit:** By stating it's the ""best I can offer"", I'm subtly establishing my final price point without being too aggressive.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while keeping me closer to my desired price point."
