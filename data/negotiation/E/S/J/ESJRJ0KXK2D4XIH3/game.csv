"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a limited time. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm really interested in purchasing this item, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $16000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to keep the deal going. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $14000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $15500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $15500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $14500, and that's my final offer. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000.",14500.0,Bob,6,
