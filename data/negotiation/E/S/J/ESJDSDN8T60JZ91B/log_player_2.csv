"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  I'm confident you'll see the potential in this and we can finalize the transaction quickly. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly less than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you $50,000."
