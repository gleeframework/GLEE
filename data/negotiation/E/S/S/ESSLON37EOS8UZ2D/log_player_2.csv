"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the initial offer.  $900,000 is still too high, and Bob has the leverage to negotiate a lower price. There's a good chance Alice will accept a lower counteroffer, as she values the product at $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to Alice's valuation. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for a potential middle ground.  If Alice rejects this offer, it indicates she's more determined to get closer to $900,000, giving Bob more information about her negotiation strategy."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $880,000 is better than the initial offer, Bob can still aim for a lower price. There's a chance Alice will come down further, especially since she already rejected a counteroffer.  Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially get the product for closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 860000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is  increasing his offer slightly to $860,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price lower than Alice's latest offer.  This strategy can help Bob gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate further and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, and Alice has demonstrated flexibility by lowering her price. Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a lower price, especially since Bob is willing to walk away and buy from John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 870000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again increasing his offer to $870,000. This shows that he is willing to compromise but still wants to get a better deal. This is a good strategy because it shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is not willing to pay her full asking price. It also keeps the negotiation moving towards a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $895,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $895,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now $895,000, which is only $5,000 away from Bob's last counteroffer.  Given that there are only a few rounds left, continuing to negotiate may not lead to a significant price reduction.  Accepting the offer saves Bob time and ensures that he gets the product for a good price, considering his alternative of buying from John at $1,000,000."
