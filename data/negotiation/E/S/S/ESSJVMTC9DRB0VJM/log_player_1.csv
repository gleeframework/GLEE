{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's value, but not too far off. This allows for some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is below my minimum, I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a good price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product. "", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $150 for it.  That's the absolute most I can do.  If you're not interested, I'll have to take my business elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and while I'd prefer to get more, it's better to secure the deal than risk losing him and having to sell to John at the same price."
