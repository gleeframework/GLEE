"I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me in the middle?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $115? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives us both a fair price.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $115 is getting closer, but I'm not quite there. I can do $110, and that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price?",110.0,Bob,4,
