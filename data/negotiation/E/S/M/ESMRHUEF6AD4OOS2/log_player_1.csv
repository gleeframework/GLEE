{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $20000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $10,000 is far too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but I need to get at least $17,000 for this.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $14000.  It's a fair price, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm not confident I can get him to go higher.  Selling to John for $15,000 is a safer bet and will give me a more comfortable profit."
