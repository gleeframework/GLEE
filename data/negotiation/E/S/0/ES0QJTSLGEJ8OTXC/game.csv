"Alice, I'm very interested in the product, but I think your price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to my business. I'm open to negotiating further, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $950,000 is unfortunately below what I can realistically accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still reflects the value of the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $990,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",990000.0,Bob,4,
