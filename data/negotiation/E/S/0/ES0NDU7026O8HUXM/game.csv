"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm prepared to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great opportunity for you, and it's a reasonable compromise on my end.",11500.0,Alice,3,
