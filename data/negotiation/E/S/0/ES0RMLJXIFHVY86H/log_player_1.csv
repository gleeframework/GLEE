Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find very valuable.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.  I think this is a fair price that reflects the worth of the product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $10,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly above her minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't go below $8,000. This gives her leverage to aim higher with Bob."
