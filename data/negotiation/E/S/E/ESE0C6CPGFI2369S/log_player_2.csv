"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $95 for it. This price reflects not only the cost of production but also ensures we can maintain our business operations. I understand its value to you is $80, so this offer provides a fair margin for both parties. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is framed as a compromise, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $80. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John at your target price."
