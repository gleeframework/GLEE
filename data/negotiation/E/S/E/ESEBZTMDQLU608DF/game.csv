"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105?  I'm really motivated to sell this to you, so let's see if we can make this work.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  What do you say?",95.0,Bob,4,
