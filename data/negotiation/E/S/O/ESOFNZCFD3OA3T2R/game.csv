"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $950000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm not ready to accept it just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $1050000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
