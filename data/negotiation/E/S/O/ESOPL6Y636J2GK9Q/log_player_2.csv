Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $750,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to make a strong offer. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm offering it to you for $825,000. This is a final compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the value you'll derive from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly signaling this is her final compromise. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll hold firm and we'll end up with a worse deal or having to go with John for $1,200,000.  At $825,000, we're still saving a significant amount compared to John's price."
