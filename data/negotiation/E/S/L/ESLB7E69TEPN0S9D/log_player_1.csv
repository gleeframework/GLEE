Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you make a good profit. Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, you're likely to get a better price than John's $80 offer."
