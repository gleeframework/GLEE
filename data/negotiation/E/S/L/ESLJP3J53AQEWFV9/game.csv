"Alice, thanks for starting the negotiation. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. I believe this reflects a fair price considering its potential.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet in the middle a bit. How about $1,300,000? I'm confident this price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a great deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer to my budget.  To be completely transparent, I have a hard limit at $1,200,000. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
