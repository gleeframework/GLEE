"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1400000 is significantly lower than the value I place on this product. I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This represents a fair compromise and allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
