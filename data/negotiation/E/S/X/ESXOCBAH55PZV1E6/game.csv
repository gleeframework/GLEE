"Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you first as a courtesy.  I believe it's incredibly valuable, and my asking price reflects that. I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  However, the price you're offering is significantly below what I consider fair for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects the true value and potential of what I'm offering.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,800,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and show my commitment to the purchase, but I need to be mindful of my budget constraints.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
