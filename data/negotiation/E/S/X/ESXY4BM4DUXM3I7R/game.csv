"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a significant discount considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer. While the product sounds promising,  $1500000 is at the upper limit of what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for it.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1200000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This still allows me to make a decent profit while offering you a fair price. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
