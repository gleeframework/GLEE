Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer. While the product sounds promising,  $1500000 is at the upper limit of what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for it.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
