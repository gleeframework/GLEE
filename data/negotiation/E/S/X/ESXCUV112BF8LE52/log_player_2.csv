"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  $1,200,000 is less than $1,500,000.
* **You are saving money:**  Even though you're paying more than the product is worth to Alice, you're still getting a better deal than John's offer."
