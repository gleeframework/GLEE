Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you've been interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate but also shows you're serious about getting a good price. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  It leaves room for you to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It's close to John's offer:**  This allows you to easily switch to John if the negotiation with Bob stalls or goes poorly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than what you're willing to accept.  You can still get a better price, and it's important to remember that you have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, you keep the negotiation open and have the opportunity to make a counteroffer that's more favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, I'm firm on a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to drop the price to $13,000.  This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a profit and gives you a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still staying above Bob's initial offer. 
* **Reasoning:** It provides a clear reason for the counteroffer, emphasizing both your need for a profit and Bob's potential benefit. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** This offer remains close to your minimum acceptable price,  while still offering Bob a better deal than his previous counteroffer.  This keeps the negotiation open and prevents you from being forced to accept a very low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. However, I am still unable to move beyond $12,000 due to my budget constraints. Could you possibly reconsider meeting me at that price point? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is insistent on his $12,000 offer. While it's tempting to try to negotiate further, it's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge, and continuing the negotiation might only waste time.

Given that John is offering $15,000, it's the most financially advantageous choice to sell to John.  This secures a higher profit and avoids any further negotiation that might potentially result in a lower price or a stalemate."
