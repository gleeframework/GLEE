"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. My initial offer is $14000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $14,000 is well above his maximum budget of $8,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower my price to $11000, which is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high. He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a better deal.  He should also keep in mind that he can always buy from John if he doesn't reach a suitable agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $9000, but I'm willing to meet you at $10000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $8000. If you're not interested, I'm open to discussing further, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is closer to his budget, it's still a significant amount over his maximum of $8,000. He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get closer to his target price.  He should also consider the option of buying from John if he doesn't reach a suitable agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $9,500 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to me is $12000. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above his budget. It's clear that they are unlikely to reach a compromise within the remaining rounds.  Since John offers the product at Bob's target price, it makes the most sense to buy it from him to avoid further negotiation."
