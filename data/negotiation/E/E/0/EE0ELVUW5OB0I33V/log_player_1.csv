"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel valued and open to the offer.
* **Strategic Price Point:** $14,000 is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, making it more appealing to Bob while still leaving room for potential counteroffers. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly conveys that I'm open to further negotiation, signaling that a deal can be reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $12,000. Would you be able to consider this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I cannot accept it.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** While Bob has clearly stated his budget, there's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting the offer signals that I'm serious about achieving a fair price and that I'm willing to continue negotiating. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I can't accept $12,000, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value of this product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** I'm offering a price that's exactly in between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reinforce why my counteroffer is still reasonable.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation open and friendly.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $13,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for Further Negotiation:**  This price leaves room for potential further negotiation if Bob counteroffers again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $12,500. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product while still fitting within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I cannot accept it.
* **Limited Negotiating Room:**  While Bob has increased his offer, we're getting closer to a stalemate.  Further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price. 
* **Weighing Options:**  I need to consider the risk of continuing negotiation versus selling to John for a guaranteed $15,000. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer one more time with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer. If he rejects it, I will likely sell to John to ensure I get my minimum desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price we can both agree on.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $13,500. This is my final offer.  If it doesn't work for you, I'll need to move on to other potential buyers.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my last counteroffer, signaling to Bob that I'm serious about getting as close to my desired price as possible. 
* **Slight Increase:** The offer is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still holding firm on my value.
* **Limited Options:**  I'm reminding Bob of his limited options.  Rejecting this offer might mean losing the opportunity to buy the product.
* **Direct and Clear:**  The message is direct and clear about the stakes involved. It emphasizes that I'm reaching the end of my willingness to negotiate.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** This is a risky move, as there's a chance Bob will reject the offer. However, it's a gamble worth taking to see if I can get a price closer to my desired range.
* **Selling to John:** If Bob rejects this final offer, I'm prepared to sell to John for $15,000 to guarantee my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've done some research and found that the product is valued around $12,000 in the market. Based on this information, I would like to propose an offer of $12,500. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We've reached a stalemate. Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and it's unlikely he will go higher.
* **Time is Running Out:** We've already had five rounds of negotiation, and I'm running out of time to reach an agreement.
* **Guaranteed Price:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.

**Decision:** It's better to cut my losses and sell to John, ensuring I get the minimum price I'm willing to accept, rather than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking a lower offer or running out of time."
