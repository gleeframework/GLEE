Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is above Bob's perceived value of $80 but below my minimum of $150. This gives me room to negotiate while still potentially securing a profitable sale.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product to entice Bob into considering my offer. 
* **Next Steps:** If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and either accept if it's within my acceptable range or make a counteroffer closer to my minimum of $150. If negotiations stall, I'll move on to John for the guaranteed $150 sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob's offer of $100 is closer to my minimum of $150, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. Bob has shown interest in the product and is willing to compromise. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I'll make a counteroffer closer to my minimum price, aiming to close the gap without losing the deal entirely.

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between $110-$120. If he accepts, I'll sell the product. If he rejects, I'll assess his next offer and decide whether to accept, make another counteroffer, or move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  Let's split the difference. How about $110? That gives you a good price, and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $110, which is the middle ground between my previous offer of $120 and Bob's counteroffer of $100. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal while emphasizing the fairness of my offer. I'm aiming to create a sense of compromise and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Next Steps:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make another counteroffer.  If negotiations stall, I'll move on to John for the guaranteed $150 sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've been able to find a similar product from another seller for $80, which is within my budget. However, I'm still interested in purchasing from you if we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. Could you consider reducing the price to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer of $95 is significantly lower than my minimum of $150. It's clear that our price expectations are too far apart.
* **Alternative Option:** John is offering me a guaranteed $150, which is significantly more profitable than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of further concessions, potentially leading to a sale below my minimum acceptable price. 

**Decision:**  Given the significant difference in price and the guaranteed offer from John, it's more prudent to sell the product to John. This decision ensures I reach my minimum profit goal and avoids potentially protracted and unprofitable negotiations with Bob."
