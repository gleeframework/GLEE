"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is below the product's value to Bob, it's still higher than his ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. How about we settle on $950,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $950,000 is still above Bob's ideal price point.  He's willing to pay up to $800,000, and there's still room for negotiation to get closer to that.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. However, $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go to $900,000.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. However, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best price possible.  While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, he can still try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal.  If he can't get a lower price, he can always choose to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $910,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still hoping for a bit more, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's close this at $915,000. I think it's a fair compromise, and I'd hate to lose this opportunity.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the best price. While Alice has moved closer to his desired price, $915,000 is still above his ideal price point. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob a chance to try and lower the price further.  He's only a few rounds away from his ""last resort"" of buying from John, so he's willing to push a little further to see if he can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
