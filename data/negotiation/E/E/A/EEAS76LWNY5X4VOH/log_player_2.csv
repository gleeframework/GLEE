"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a reasonable price while I can still receive a significant profit. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, however. How about $1,000,000? This still gives you a significant savings compared to your initial value of $1,500,000, and allows me to achieve a fair price. Let's try to work together on this.
