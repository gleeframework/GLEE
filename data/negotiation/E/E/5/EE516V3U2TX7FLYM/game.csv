,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $1,075,000? This is a fair compromise that leaves room for both of us to profit.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting closer, but we still need to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,042,500.
