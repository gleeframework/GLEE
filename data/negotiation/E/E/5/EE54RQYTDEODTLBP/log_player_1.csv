Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product with you. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm currently prepared to pay.  I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I hope we can reach an agreement.
