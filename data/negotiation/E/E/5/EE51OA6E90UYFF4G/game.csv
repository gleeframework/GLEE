"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for you as it's above your value of $15,000.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $13,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $16,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to accept $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $15,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",15250.0,Alice,5,
