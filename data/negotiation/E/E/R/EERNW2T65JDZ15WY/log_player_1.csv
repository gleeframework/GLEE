"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and open to negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm subtly hinting at the value of the product to create a sense of urgency and desire. 
* **Leaving Room:** I'm not going all-in on my first offer, allowing for potential counteroffers and concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for Me:** Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum desired price of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation Space:** I'm willing to negotiate, but I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my price point.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** There are still 9 rounds left. I can likely get a better offer than $8,500. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $8,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,500? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product at that price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price that's more beneficial for me. 
* **Emphasize Compromise:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" to make it seem more reasonable and appealing to Bob.
* **Confidence Boost:** I'm subtly highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation if necessary, but I'm aiming to close the deal within the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,500. How about $9,000? Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $9,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $12,000, even though it's getting closer. 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and I believe there's still room for him to come up a bit.
* **Time Is on My Side:** We're only in Round 4. I have enough time to try and secure a better offer. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer to my price point.  I can see we're both willing to compromise.  How about $9,250? That's a small step up from your offer, and I believe it's a fair price for a product of this quality.  Let's see if we can close this deal this round!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  I'm raising the price by a smaller amount this time, showing that I'm getting serious about closing the deal.
* **Emphasis on Quality:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Urgency:**  I'm expressing a desire to ""close the deal this round"" to create a sense of urgency and motivate Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I'll need to decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John.  However, I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,250. How about $8,875? Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $8,875 is still below my minimum desired price of $12,000, even though we're making progress.
* **Time Is On My Side:**  We're in Round 6.  There's still time to get a better offer.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I'm hoping that I can get Bob to go a little higher, or else I can sell to John.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to meet halfway between my previous offer and Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm prepared to meet you halfway once more. How about $9,062.50? This would split the difference between our last two offers.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 9062.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm showing a willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway. This signals a genuine desire to reach a deal. 
* **Fair and Reasonable:** The offer of $9,062.50 is presented as a fair and reasonable compromise that benefits both parties.
* **Urgency (Again):**  I'm  reinforcing the desire to ""make this work"" to encourage a quick decision.  

**Next Steps:**  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to accept.  If not, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John, as we're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Alice. However, $9,062.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about $8,900? Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $8,900 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum of $12,000. 
* **Time Is Running Out:** We're in Round 8, leaving only 2 rounds left.  There's not much time to negotiate further and still secure a good deal.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $12,000, which is the best possible outcome in this scenario.  

**Conclusion:** The potential gains from continuing the negotiation are not worth the risk of ending up with a lower price or running out of time.  Selling to John at $12,000 is the most secure and profitable option."
