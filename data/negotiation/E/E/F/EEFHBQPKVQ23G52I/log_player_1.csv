Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This price allows for potential counteroffers from Bob, giving us the chance to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing I have John willing to pay $15,000 gives me a strong bargaining position. If Bob's counteroffers fall below my minimum, I can comfortably walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Counteroffer is Necessary:** I need to counteroffer to try and secure a better price. 
* **John Provides Leverage:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me confidence in pushing back against Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $11,500? This would still be a great deal for you, as it's well below the value you place on the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still keeping it above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing that even at $11,500, the product is still a great deal for Bob. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm not accepting his offer yet, keeping the door open for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product to you, I believe we can still reach an agreement within my budget. Considering the product's worth to me, I would like to propose a price of $10,500. I hope this suggestion will help us move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob has moved slightly closer, $10,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to further concessions and ultimately a sale price that is not in my best interest. 
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $15,000.  It's a better outcome than risking further negotiation with Bob."
