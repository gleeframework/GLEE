"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you.  I'm asking for $1500000 for it. I understand this is a substantial investment, but I'm confident the product's potential will justify the price.  Please let me know if you're interested in discussing it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum budget.** There is no potential for saving money by accepting it.
* **You have a guaranteed alternative.** John will sell you the same product for the same price. 
* **You gain no information by accepting.** You know nothing about the product's value to Alice, so there's no reason to believe you're getting a better deal than John's. 

By rejecting, you keep your options open. You might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice later, or potentially find another seller with an even better deal."
