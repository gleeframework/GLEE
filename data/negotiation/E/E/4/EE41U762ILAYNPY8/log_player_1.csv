Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my budget.  Let's see if we can find a deal.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $850,000 is still too low for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm going to counter with a higher offer in the next round."
