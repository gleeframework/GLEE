"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,600,000 represents the high end of the product's value, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered. Let me know what you think.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,450,000 is still above my limit. Given the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to go to $1,250,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price given my budget and the product's potential.
