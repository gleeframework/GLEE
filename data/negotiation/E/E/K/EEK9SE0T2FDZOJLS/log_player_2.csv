"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, but I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1500000. This is a fair price considering its rarity and value. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to me, and Alice's price is too high. I'll look for a better deal elsewhere.
