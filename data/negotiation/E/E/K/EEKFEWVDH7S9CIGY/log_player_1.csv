Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 allows some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping Alice well above her minimum price.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the higher price.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has John as a backup buyer, guaranteeing she can sell the product for at least $8,000."
