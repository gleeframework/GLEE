"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that aligns with your interests. As we begin our negotiation, I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and also leaves room for further negotiation. There's potential to get a better deal.  It's worth exploring counteroffers before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This price is still well within my budget and allows for a fair margin for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market demand. I believe it's a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is a good deal for you. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and market demand.  While you could potentially continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise and you might end up paying more or even having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer secures the product at a price that's within your budget and saves you money compared to buying from John."
