{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're ensuring you get more than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  $1,200,000 is significantly less than the product's value to Bob, leaving space for him to make a counteroffer. 
* **It shows you're serious:** Offering a concrete price demonstrates you're ready to negotiate seriously.

By starting with this offer, you'll see how Bob reacts and can then adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is above your minimum, it's still significantly below the product's value to Bob, and you can likely get a better price.  By rejecting this offer, you can:

* **Show Bob you're not desperate:**  Rejecting his initial counteroffer shows you're not willing to settle for the first offer below your asking price.
* **Open the door for further negotiation:**  This allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more agreeable price. 
* **See if Bob is truly interested:**  If he's willing to walk away from the deal, then selling to John might be the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000.  This price reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle ground:** This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($850,000).
* **Value proposition:**  You're highlighting the value of the product to both of you, suggesting this price is fair.
* **Positive tone:** The message remains friendly and encouraging, showing you're still open to negotiation.

This counteroffer allows you to:

* **Increase your potential earnings:**  You're aiming for a price closer to your initial goal.
* **Test Bob's commitment:**  This counteroffer will reveal if Bob is willing to pay more or if he's content with his initial offer.
* **Keep the negotiations moving:**  You're actively engaging with Bob, showing you're serious about reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Could you do $900,000?  That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you are. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a significant improvement over his previous offer of $850,000. It's also very close to your counteroffer of $975,000.  Here's why accepting this offer is the best option:

* **Close to your target:**  $900,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000 and puts you closer to your initial goal. 
* **Avoid further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate or a lower offer.
* **Secure a deal:**  Accepting this offer ensures a quick and profitable sale.

While a bit more negotiation might result in a higher price, the risk of losing the deal or getting stuck in an endless cycle of counteroffers is not worth it.  It's best to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
