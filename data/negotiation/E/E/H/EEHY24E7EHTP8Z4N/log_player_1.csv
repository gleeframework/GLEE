"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me ($12,000). I have 10 rounds and can still counteroffer, aiming for a higher price.  There's potential to get closer to my desired price point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet halfway at $9,250? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum of $8,000, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I have 6 more rounds left, and with a bit of negotiation, I can likely get closer to my desired price point of $9,250 or even higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $9,000. That's a good compromise, and we can both walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $9000. Would you be willing to consider $8500 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than what the product is worth to me. I have 4 more rounds and can still try to negotiate a higher price. Additionally, if I reject this offer, I can potentially get closer to my desired price point of $9,000.  It's a risk, but potentially worth it."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $8,500 is still too low for me.  Let's try $8,750 as a final compromise. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't regret.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8750}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $8750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $8375? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum of $8,000, I still have 2 more rounds left and I'm determined to get a better price.  I'm confident I can convince Bob to come up a bit more in the next round.  If I reject, there's a chance I can close the deal at $8,500 or higher in the final rounds."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $8,375 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $8,500 as a final compromise. This is the last offer I'm willing to make.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $8500. I'm willing to go up to $8200, but no higher. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round, and Bob's offer of $8,200 is below my minimum of $8,000.  I've already spent many rounds trying to negotiate a higher price, but Bob is not budging.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, it's not worth risking losing the deal altogether. Selling to John for $8,000 ensures I get at least my minimum asking price."
