"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet halfway at $9250? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $9000. That's a good compromise, and we can both walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $9000. Would you be willing to consider $8500 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway this time.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $8500 is still too low for me.  Let's try $8750 as a final compromise. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't regret.  What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $8750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $8375?",8375.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $8375 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $8500 as a final compromise. This is the last offer I'm willing to make.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't regret.  What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $8500. I'm willing to go up to $8200, but no higher. This is my final offer.",8200.0,Bob,10,
