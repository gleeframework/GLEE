Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it!  My asking price is $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than Bob's value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build a positive rapport with Bob by expressing my belief that he'd enjoy the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 

I'm offering $95, which is closer to Bob's value but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm also reinforcing the value proposition for Bob, emphasizing that this is a great deal for him."

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm offering $90, which is right in the middle between my last offer and Bob's last offer. I'm also emphasizing the fairness of this price for both of us."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm offering $88.50, which is a compromise between Bob's last offer and my minimum acceptable price. I'm also emphasizing the reasonableness of this price, highlighting that it's a win-win situation."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can we meet at that price?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are in round 8 and Bob is still not budging much on his price. I've tried to negotiate in good faith but it seems like we're at an impasse. To avoid further negotiation and guarantee a sale at my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120."
