{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what I could get elsewhere.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's below your minimum:**  You're still making a profit well above your minimum of $1,500,000.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  The price is significantly lower than what you'd sell to John, and Bob has room to negotiate.
* **It allows for negotiation:**  This price leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth that could potentially get you closer to your ideal price. 

Remember, you have John as a backup, so you don't need to settle for a price you're uncomfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit high for my budget right now.  Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to take the $600,000, selling to John for $1,500,000 is a much better deal.  

You can use this rejection to push Bob higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1 million to make this work.  Would you be willing to consider $900,000? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This counteroffer does the following:

* **It's firm but fair:** You're rejecting Bob's offer, but you're also showing willingness to negotiate.
* **It's a compromise:** You're moving closer to Bob's offer, but you're still well above your minimum price.
* **It emphasizes the value:** You're reminding Bob of the product's worth and why this is a good deal for him.

This counteroffer gives Bob a chance to reconsider, but it still positions you in a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is closer to your minimum price, it's still not in the range you'd like.  You're still in a good position with John as a backup, so you can continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $750,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. Would you be interested in $825,000?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you compared to what you'd have to pay elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 825000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Is a compromise:** You're moving towards Bob's offer, but still above your minimum.
* **Uses a specific number:** This shows you're serious about making a deal.
* **Highlights the value for Bob:**  You're emphasizing the price is still very good for him.

This offer is a good balance between securing a reasonable price and keeping the negotiation open."
