"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what I could get elsewhere.  Let me know what you think.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1 million to make this work.  Would you be willing to consider $900,000? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.

Alice's offer:

That's a fair compromise for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you compared to what you'd have to pay elsewhere.
