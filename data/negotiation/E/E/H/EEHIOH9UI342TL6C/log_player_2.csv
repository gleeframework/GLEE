"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to start at $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high. It's in my best interest to try and negotiate a lower price. I have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John as a backup, so there's room to play it safe and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This would still be a significant gain for you, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product offers. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm still confident I can negotiate a better price, given that I have plenty of rounds left and the option to buy from John as a fallback."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $950,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  $950,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that's closer to the value this product represents for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This would still leave you with a substantial profit, and it would be a fair compromise considering the product's value.  Let's work together to bridge this gap and finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I have several rounds left and the backup option of buying from John, so I can afford to push for a lower price. My goal is to save as much money as possible, and I believe we can find a more favorable price point."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm willing to compromise and offer $975,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to come up to $975,000. However, to make this deal work for me, I need to be closer to $1,000,000.

Let's reach an agreement and finalize this deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $987,500 is getting closer to my target, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I have a few rounds left and the backup option of buying from John, so I'm going to continue pushing for a lower price. I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating."
