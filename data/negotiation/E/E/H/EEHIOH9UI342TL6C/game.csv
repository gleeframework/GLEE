"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to start at $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This would still be a significant gain for you, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product offers. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This is a significant price for me, and I believe it's fair considering the value I'll be getting from the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  $950,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that's closer to the value this product represents for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This would still leave you with a substantial profit, and it would be a fair compromise considering the product's value.  Let's work together to bridge this gap and finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is a good step in the right direction, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $950,000.  I'm willing to compromise and offer $975,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to come up to $975,000. However, to make this deal work for me, I need to be closer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $987,500. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's reach an agreement and finalize this deal.",987500.0,Alice,7,
