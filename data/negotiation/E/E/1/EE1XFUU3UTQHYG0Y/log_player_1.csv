Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000,  but still leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential win-win situation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to you. It's worth exploring if you can get closer to your target price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm sticking with my initial counteroffer. It's a fair price that still allows for some profit for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is still higher than John's, it's getting increasingly lower and the negotiation process seems to be dragging on. At this point, it's better to secure the guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000 rather than risk further rounds of negotiation with Bob that might not lead to a better outcome."
