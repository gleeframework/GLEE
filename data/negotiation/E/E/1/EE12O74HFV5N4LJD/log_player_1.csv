Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This feels like a fair price, as it's still a great deal for you compared to your value of $10,000. What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
