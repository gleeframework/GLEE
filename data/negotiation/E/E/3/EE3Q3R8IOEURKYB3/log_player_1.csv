"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob.  This allows room for negotiation and hopefully gives me a good starting point for a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

I'm counter-offering with $8,750. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aim for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit lower than I initially wanted, it's a fair price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with the lower price from John."
