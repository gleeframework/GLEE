"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? I'm willing to be flexible to make this deal happen.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate your flexibility. Could you do $9,500? That would work much better for me.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles.  $9,500 just doesn't work for me.  Let's compromise. I'll meet you halfway at $10,000.  This is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
