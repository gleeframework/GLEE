"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a little high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $10,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to do $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still quite low considering what you'll be getting out of it.  My final offer is $11,750.  This is a very fair deal.",11750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're tough! I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and call it a deal at $11,375?",11375.0,Bob,6,
