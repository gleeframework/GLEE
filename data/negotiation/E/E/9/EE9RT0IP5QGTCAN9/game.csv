"Alice, your offer of $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to see if we can reach a deal.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can make this work.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this now.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $13,000. This price is fair considering the value of the product and my budget. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this price. ",13000.0,Bob,6,
