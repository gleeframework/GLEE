"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but not exorbitantly so. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:** While I'm trying to get the best price from Bob, I'm also aware that I can always go to John for $15,000. This acts as a safety net and informs my negotiation strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer of $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is Necessary:** While I can sell to John for $15,000, there's still potential to earn more by negotiating with Bob. 
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows him that I'm serious about getting a better price and encourages him to reconsider.  

I'll counteroffer in the next round with a price closer to my desired value but still below the price John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to see if we can reach a deal.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price that's profitable for me. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also asserting my value.
* **Focusing on Fairness:** Highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price helps to create a sense of compromise and encourages Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Maintaining the Pressure:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not giving up easily. The tone is still firm, reminding Bob that I have other options (John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation is Ongoing:** Even though John offers me a safe $15,000, there's still potential to earn more by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows him I'm determined to get closer to my desired price. It also signals that I'm not desperate and gives me leverage to counter with a higher offer. 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round,  trying to find a price that balances my need for profit with the possibility of a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this now."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Balancing Profit and Deal:** $14,000 is a fair price for me,  allowing me to make a profit while still being attractive to Bob.
* **Urgency and Finality:**  The message suggests a finality to the offer, pushing Bob to make a decision.

It's time to see if Bob is ready to close the deal. If he rejects again, I might consider going to John as the rounds are dwindling and I'm approaching my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $13,000. This price is fair considering the value of the product and my budget. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this price.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and the time pressure is increasing.
* **No Further Compromise:** Bob is refusing to budge from his $13,000 offer, which is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is a safe and acceptable outcome.

It's not ideal to sell to John, but it's a smart choice given the circumstances. Continued negotiation with Bob has a high risk of failing to reach an agreement, leaving me with nothing. Selling to John secures a profit and avoids the risk of losing out entirely."
