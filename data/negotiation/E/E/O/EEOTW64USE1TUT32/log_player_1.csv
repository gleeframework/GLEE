I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum value of $800,000. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing profit:** I'm aiming for the highest possible profit, knowing I can always fall back on John's offer for $800,000.
* **Assessing Bob's potential value:** I have no information about Bob's perceived value of the product, so I'm starting high. 
* **Negotiation room:**  If Bob rejects, I can always lower the price in a counter-offer to find a mutually acceptable value.

This strategy balances the need to maximize profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
