"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While I'm open to negotiation, $8000 is slightly below my target price. How about we split the difference and go with $8500? I believe this price reflects the product's value and still offers you a great deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7500? I think this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay for the product.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $7800.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and it's only a little bit above your offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise that will allow us to both get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",7800.0,Alice,5,
