{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below your minimum value of $10,000 but still gives you a good profit.  It's also likely to be appealing to Bob, who values the product at $8,000. If he rejects it, you can then gauge his interest and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum value. While it's tempting to take the $8,500, it's not worth losing $1,500 when you can get $10,000 from John. It's better to reject Bob's offer and see if you can get closer to your desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is tempting, I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $9,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $8,500 is the most I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is firm on his offer of $8,500.  While you could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll budge much further. You're at risk of getting into a prolonged negotiation without a clear path to a price you're happy with.  Since John is willing to pay your minimum price of $10,000, it's the best decision to sell to John and avoid any further haggling."
