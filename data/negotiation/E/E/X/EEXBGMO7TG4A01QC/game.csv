"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000,  reflecting a significant discount from my initial offer. This should be a fair price considering the product's value.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $900,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $925,000, which is a fair compromise. This would allow me to get closer to my target price while ensuring a good deal for you. Let's work together to close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $925,000 is close, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $910,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of your product.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your financial constraints, but $910,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $915,000. This is a very fair price, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's make this happen!",915000.0,Alice,7,
