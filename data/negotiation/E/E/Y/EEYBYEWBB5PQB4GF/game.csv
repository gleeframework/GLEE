"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in your product, $1000000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750000.  Let me know if that's a starting point for us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. While $750000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $900000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a significant saving compared to my initial offer. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $825000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,
