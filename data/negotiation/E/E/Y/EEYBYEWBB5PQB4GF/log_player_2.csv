"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $1,000,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer. You can always negotiate a lower price with Alice or fall back to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. While $750000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $900000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a significant saving compared to my initial offer. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $1,000,000 to $900,000, but it's still above your counteroffer of $750,000.  There's still room for negotiation to find a middle ground, so rejecting this offer allows you to continue the negotiation process and potentially get a better price."
