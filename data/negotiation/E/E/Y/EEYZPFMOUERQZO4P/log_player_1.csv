{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. It's not a huge jump, and it leaves room for potential counteroffers and a mutually agreeable price.  I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
