"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I know the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, so there's room for negotiation.  I'm hoping he'll counter with a reasonable offer. If not, I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is a decent offer, I'm still confident I can get closer to my target.  I'm going to counter and see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show good faith and encourage Bob to come up a bit.  $14,000 is still a good profit for me, and I think it's within the range of what Bob might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price.  While $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway.  $13,500 is a compromise that I think is fair to both of us.  I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finally close this deal."
