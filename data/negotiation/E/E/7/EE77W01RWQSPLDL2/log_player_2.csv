"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to you, given its potential to generate significant returns. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects the value I've placed on the product, while still allowing for a substantial profit for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting and making a counteroffer allows him to potentially secure a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements. Given the product's unique capabilities and potential for future growth, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above what Bob is comfortable with.  Bob can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  The difference between $1,050,000 and $950,000 is significant enough to justify another round of counteroffers."
