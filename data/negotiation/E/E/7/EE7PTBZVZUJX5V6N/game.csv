"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find valuable.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? ",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This feels like a fair price that benefits both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
