Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a good starting point as it's a price that's fair for both of us. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $100, and it leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  I'm also aware that Bob values the product at $120, so there's potential for a deal to be reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, and it's closer to my initial offer of $115. It's likely that further negotiation would only result in a small price increase.  Accepting his offer is the most efficient way to secure a sale and make a profit."
