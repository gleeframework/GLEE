"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as I'm confident it will be very valuable to your business. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $10,000. There's a chance you could get a better price from Alice by rejecting her initial offer."
