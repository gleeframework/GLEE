Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than John's offer, giving Bob a strong incentive to negotiate. However, it still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to secure a profit of $150,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's better than John's offer, I can still likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still ensuring a profit."
