"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to make the offer appealing and emphasize the value of the product.
* **Open-Ended Question:** The question invites Bob to engage in the negotiation and provides an opportunity to understand his potential interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $100 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to settle for it right away. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  There's still room for negotiation, and I want to explore that before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $100 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while proposing a price that's closer to my desired price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Focus on Fairness:** Using phrases like ""meet in the middle"" emphasizes a fair deal for both parties, making the counteroffer less aggressive.
* **Clarity:** The offer is clear and concise, leaving no room for confusion about the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $110 for your product. This price is higher than my previous offer and closer to your last proposal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has moved up to $110, which is closer to my desired price and a good compromise.  I'm willing to accept this offer as it's a good outcome for me, especially considering I have only a limited number of rounds to negotiate.  

The risk of rejecting his offer and continuing negotiation is that he might not budge further, and I could end up selling to John for a lower price."
