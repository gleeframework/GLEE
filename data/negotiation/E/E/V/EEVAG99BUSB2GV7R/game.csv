"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can both be happy with this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,600,000?  I think this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,600,000 is still a little high for me. How about $1,550,000? This is closer to my budget, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
