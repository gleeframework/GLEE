"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. This price still reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $825,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $835,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",835000.0,Alice,5,
