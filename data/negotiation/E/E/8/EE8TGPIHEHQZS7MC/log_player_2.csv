"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $125. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

While $125 is a better price than John's $150, you're trying to save as much money as possible. You can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she lowers her price."
