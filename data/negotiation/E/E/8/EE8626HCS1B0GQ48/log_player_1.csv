"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation while still aiming high. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I don't want to start too low, but I also want to give Bob a reason to negotiate rather than rejecting the offer outright. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The presence of John provides a safety net, allowing me to walk away from a bad deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below both my minimum ($1,000,000) and his perceived value ($1,200,000).  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to accept such a low offer this early in the negotiation.  I believe there's room to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is significantly below what I can accept for this product.  To be fair to both of us, would you consider $1,075,000?"" ,
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Hold Firm:** I'm lowering my price slightly to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding relatively firm above my $1,000,000 minimum. 
* **Target the Middle Ground:** I'm aiming for a price closer to the middle of our current positions to try and find a compromise. 
* **Maintain Pressure:**  While I have John as a backup, I still want to reach a deal with Bob, so my counteroffer encourages continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $987,500? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Close to Goal:** Bob's offer of $987,500 is above my absolute minimum of $1,000,000 and fairly close to the middle ground between our initial positions. 
* **Time Constraint:** We are now in Round 4, and while I have more rounds to negotiate, there's no guarantee Bob will move significantly closer to my desired price.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly higher offer from Bob carries the risk of him walking away. Accepting his current offer guarantees a good profit."
