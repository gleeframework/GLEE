"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe is of great value to your business. My starting price is $1,200,000. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the potential value I see in this product for my business.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum needs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still leaves room for both of us to make a good deal. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  However, $1,000,000 is still a stretch for my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to move forward with this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's make this happen.",975000.0,Alice,5,
