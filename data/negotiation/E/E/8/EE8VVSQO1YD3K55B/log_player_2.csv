"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe is of great value to your business. My starting price is $1,200,000. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  I can get the product for a much lower price, even from John, who is my backup option.  I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the potential value I see in this product for my business."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum needs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still leaves room for both of us to make a good deal. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,000,000 is still too high. I am trying to get the product for as low as possible, and there are still rounds left to negotiate. I will reject this offer and try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  However, $1,000,000 is still a stretch for my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to move forward with this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is within my budget and a significant improvement from previous rounds.  This is a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the product by continuing to negotiate.  I'll accept the offer and move forward with the purchase."
