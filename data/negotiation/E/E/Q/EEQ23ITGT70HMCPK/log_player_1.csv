{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but significantly lower than my minimum. This allows for negotiation and potential profit while keeping John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get closer to my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial assessment, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $9,500 to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. I think this is a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target, Bob's offer is close enough. It's a good compromise and above my minimum acceptable price.  There's a chance I could push for more, but the risk of further negotiation falling apart isn't worth it. I'm happy to accept this offer."
