"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, aiming for a good profit. I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  There's still a chance that I can get a better deal with Bob, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price to my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. This is a fair price for me, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. I'll see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to earn. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to $12,000. With 6 rounds left, there's still time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $11,000. This is a good compromise that's still within my acceptable range, and it might be enough to convince Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,500 is still a bit below what I'd like to get, and I have 4 rounds left to negotiate. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm going to raise my offer slightly to $11,500. It's a small increase, but it might be enough to bridge the gap with Bob and close the deal.  We're getting close to the end of our rounds, so it's time to make a decisive move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to get closer to my target price.  Bob is clearly not willing to go much higher, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. It's better to sell the product to John for $12,000 and secure a guaranteed profit."
