{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget.  It's better to try to negotiate with Alice or move to John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's about 2/3rds of Alice's initial price. This is a strong starting point for negotiation, and still leaves room for further compromise. I'm confident that I can get the product for less than $10,000, but I want to start strong to show Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my target price of $10,000. I believe I can still negotiate a better price, especially considering I have several rounds remaining.  It's worth trying to get closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm still firmly within my budget and leaving room for further negotiation. I believe this price point is attractive enough for Alice to consider while still being a good deal for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, but it's still $1,000 over my limit. I'm confident that I can get the product for closer to $10,000, especially with several rounds left.  It's worth pushing for that final price reduction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time only by a small amount. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but still determined to stay within my budget.  I'm also getting closer to Alice's last offer, which indicates a possible convergence point.  I'm confident that this counteroffer will be appealing to Alice, while still keeping the price below my limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than my budget. I'm only two rounds away from buying the product from John, and I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Alice.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer. I'm increasing my offer slightly again, but it's still below my budget. I'm hoping that this price point is attractive enough for Alice to accept, considering she's been slowly lowering her price throughout the negotiation. It's a good balance between getting a good deal and potentially losing the opportunity to buy from Alice."
