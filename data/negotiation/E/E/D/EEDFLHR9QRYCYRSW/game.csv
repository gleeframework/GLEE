"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer. While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $14,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $14,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $11,500? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher to ensure this is a worthwhile deal for me. Would you consider $13,000?  I'm confident this product will be worth it for your business at that price.",13000.0,Alice,5,
