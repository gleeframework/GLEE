"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. I believe it's a fair deal and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you're looking for a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $8,500. This is still a good deal for me, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,5,
