"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you consider $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm looking to make a deal, $650,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I'm confident I can find a price that works for both of us."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $650,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  How about we meet in the middle and settle on $775,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the value it brings to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with the $775,000 offer.  I'm not desperate to sell and I believe I can get a better price. I have 6 rounds left to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product and my own costs, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident that it will be a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close. I understand the value, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $825,000?  That's a strong offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $825,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and it's close enough to where I think I can close the deal. I have 4 rounds left, but I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
