"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as you've indicated it's worth $1,500,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While you could reject her offer hoping for a lower price, there's no guarantee she'll go lower and you risk having to buy from John at your maximum budget."
