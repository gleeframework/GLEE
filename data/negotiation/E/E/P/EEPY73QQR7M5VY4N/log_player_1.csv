Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80 but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price we both agree on.
* **Message:** My message is friendly and casual, aiming to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider my offer.

**Strategy:**

* I want to maximize my profit while also being open to negotiation. 
* If Bob accepts, I'm happy with the $100 profit. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and potentially make another counteroffer based on how close his offer is to my desired price. 
* I'm keeping the option to sell to John for $120 as a safety net. This means I won't accept any offer lower than $120, ensuring I never lose money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, but still below it.
* **Strategy:**  I'm not in a hurry to sell and want to try to maximize my profit.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a higher price, potentially reaching a better deal. 
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $120 is a guaranteed profit, I'm not desperate to sell.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a great price for the product, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $110, which is halfway between my minimum acceptable price of $120 and Bob's offer of $90. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product.
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message positive and reaffirming the value of the product. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to find a middle ground that both Bob and I can agree on. 
* This counteroffer gives Bob a chance to consider a higher price while still being a better deal than his initial offer. 
* If Bob rejects this offer, I might be willing to consider another counteroffer, but I'll likely stick closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120."
