"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you're willing to pay. John offers a much better deal at $80, which is your target price."
