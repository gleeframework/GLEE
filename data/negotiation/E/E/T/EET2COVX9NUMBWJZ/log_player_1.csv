Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's a great deal! I'm willing to let it go for $90.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $90 is higher than your minimum price of $80, giving you a profit.
* **It's not too high:** If Bob is a savvy buyer, a very high price might immediately deter him. 
* **The message is friendly and inviting:** This encourages Bob to consider the offer without feeling pressured.

Let me know how Bob responds, and we can adjust your strategy accordingly!"
