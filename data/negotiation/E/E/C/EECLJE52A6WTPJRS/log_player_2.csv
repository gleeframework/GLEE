"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price, meaning you won't save any money by accepting. Since John is also willing to sell for that price, buying from John is the same financially, but you avoid the potential for future haggling or complications with Alice."
