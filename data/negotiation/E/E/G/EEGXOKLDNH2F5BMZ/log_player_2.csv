"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I think it would be perfect for you!  I'm looking for a price around $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price to leave room for negotiation and signal that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Respectful Tone:**  I maintain a polite and respectful tone to foster a positive negotiation environment. 
* **Clear Intention:**  I clearly state my desired price and ask for Alice's feedback, showing I'm ready to engage in a discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm open to negotiation. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice moved closer to my price, but $17,000 is still significantly above my $15,000 maximum. I have room to negotiate further.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** Rejecting this offer shows Alice I'm serious about getting a better price and keeps the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $17,000 is closer, but still a little high for my budget.  How about we settle at $14,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Move Toward Budget:** I'm inching closer to my $15,000 maximum while still trying to leave myself a little wiggle room in case Alice is firm.
* **Seeking Common Ground:**  By saying ""$14,000 is a fair price,"" I'm trying to position this offer as reasonable and mutually beneficial.
* **Leaving Room for Final Compromise:** This offer gives Alice the option to accept, counter with $15,000 (which I'd likely accept), or continue negotiating."
