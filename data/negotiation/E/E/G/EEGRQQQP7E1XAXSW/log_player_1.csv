Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, I'll try to get as close to that as possible while still making a profit. I'll offer the product to Bob for:

{""product_price"": $950,000}

This is a relatively high offer, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay it since it's still below the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is lower than I had hoped for, but it's still a decent price. Since I can sell the product to John for $800,000, I'll weigh my options carefully.

In this case, I'll choose:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer of $750,000 and send a counteroffer to try to get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $750,000, I'll try to get closer to my target price of $950,000. I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my target price. Here's my counteroffer:
