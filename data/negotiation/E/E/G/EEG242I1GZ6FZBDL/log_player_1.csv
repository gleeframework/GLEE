Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win scenario. Bob gets it for $50,000 less than its worth to him, and you earn $150,000 more than your minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly without revealing John's guaranteed purchase."
