"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its unique value, I'm initially offering it at $1,800,000."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more than expected.
* **Signaling Value:** The high initial price signals the product's significant value to you, potentially increasing Bob's perceived value as well. 
* **Leaving Room:** By starting at $1,800,000, there's a substantial margin for negotiation before reaching Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000 or your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **John as Leverage:** While we don't mention John explicitly, the knowledge that you have another potential buyer provides a subtle but important point of leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a significant sum and closer to your target, accepting immediately would leave potential profit on the table. Bob's message indicates willingness to negotiate (""serious offer,"" ""stay within my budget"").  Proceeding to the next round allows you to counter and explore if Bob is willing to go higher."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product to me is quite significant. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,650,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding Ground:** We're moving down from our initial offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Reduction:** The decrease to $1,650,000 is substantial ($150,000) but keeps us well above Bob's offer and your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer gauges Bob's flexibility. Will he move closer to our price, or is his offer closer to his limit? This information will guide your strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $1,500,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Signals, But Room Remains:** Bob's message is encouraging. He acknowledges your flexibility and is willing to ""meet halfway,"" indicating a desire to find a deal. However, $1,500,000 is still significantly above your guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By rejecting this offer, you maintain negotiating pressure. There's a reasonable chance Bob might increase his offer further, especially as you approach the halfway point in the rounds. 
* **John as Safety Net:** Remember, you have John as a guaranteed buyer. This allows you to be more assertive in your negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer on this.  To show my willingness to make a deal happen, I'll come down to $1,575,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1575000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  While we're not meeting Bob at his desired price point, a $75,000 drop from our previous counteroffer signals significant movement on our part. 
* **Anchoring:** By proposing $1,575,000, we're aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to our price.  We're splitting the difference between his offer and our last counteroffer, which might appear like a reasonable compromise.
* **Sense of Urgency:** We're halfway through the rounds.  Subtly conveying a bit more urgency might encourage Bob to act before you consider alternative options more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,500,000 and $1,575,000, so how about $1,537,500? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,537,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,537,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit Margin:** $1,537,500 represents a healthy profit margin above your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and Bob's initial offer. 
* **Meeting Halfway:**  Bob's willingness to meet precisely in the middle signals a genuine desire to close the deal. This collaborative approach suggests he may not be willing to go much higher. 
* **Time Value:**  You're past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. While you have time, securing a deal now avoids the risk of further impasse and potential time wasted if you eventually decide to sell to John."
