"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and it allows for both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $875,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm happy to pay $890,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it allows for both of us to get a good deal. I believe this is a reasonable offer that reflects our mutual desire to reach an agreement.",890000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $895,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",895000.0,Alice,7,
