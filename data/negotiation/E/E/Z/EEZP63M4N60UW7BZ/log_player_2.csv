"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is a better price than John's $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer to test the waters and see how much Alice is willing to budge.  He's aiming to get closer to his target price of $1,200,000 but leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's get this deal done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  Bob wants to try to get the price down to $1,300,000 or less, so he'll reject the offer and continue negotiating.  There are still several rounds left, and he has the option to buy from John for $1,200,000 as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm firm on $1,300,000. This is my final offer.  If it's not acceptable, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his previous counteroffer of $1,300,000. He's trying to show Alice that he's serious about getting a better price and that he's not willing to go any higher. He's also putting pressure on Alice by saying it's his ""final offer"" and hinting that he might have to look elsewhere if she doesn't accept. This is a strategic move to potentially get Alice to cave and accept his offer."
