"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 at this time.  It's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it yourself.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go to $1,150,000, which is a substantial increase from my last offer and hopefully a reasonable compromise. Let's try to close this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value of this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to agree to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, reflecting a significant concession on my part and bringing us very close to your price point.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,250,000. It's getting closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm willing to go to $1,225,000, which is a significant move from my last offer. I hope you'll consider it.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
