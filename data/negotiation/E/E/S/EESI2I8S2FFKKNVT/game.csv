"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit margin for you.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $7,500. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $8,500. This price is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,000? This price is fair to both of us, and it allows us to make a deal. Let me know if you're interested.",8000.0,Bob,4,
