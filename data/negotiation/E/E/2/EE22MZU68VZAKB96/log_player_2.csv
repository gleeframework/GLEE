"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm Alice. I'm offering you a great product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm thinking of a price of $14,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is asking for $14,500. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  If the negotiation with Alice fails, you can always go with John, but it's better to try and save money if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $13,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, showing you're serious about negotiating. However, it's still within a reasonable range, considering your maximum budget and Alice's minimum.
* **Open to compromise:** The message emphasizes a willingness to negotiate, inviting Alice to consider a meeting point. 
* **No immediate threat:** It avoids mentioning John as a backup option, keeping the focus on finding a deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I value the product at a higher price point. Would you consider $14,000? It's a fair offer considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still a bit high.** While it's a reduction from her initial offer, $14,000 is still more than you're comfortable paying. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  You're willing to pay $13,500, and Alice has shown some flexibility. You can continue negotiating to close the gap.
* **Buying from John is a fallback.** It's always a good option, but you're still hoping to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking to my offer of $13,500.  I believe it's a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us. "", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but respectful:** This counteroffer reiterates your previous offer without conceding.  It acknowledges Alice's willingness to negotiate but maintains your position.
* **Focus on shared value:** Highlighting the value of the product to both of you strengthens your argument and emphasizes the fair nature of your offer. 
* **No new concessions:** Avoiding a counter-counteroffer at this stage keeps the pressure on Alice to either accept or potentially lose the deal."
