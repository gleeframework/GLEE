"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a great deal for both of us - you'll get a valuable asset at a price lower than its true worth to you, and I'll get a fair return on my investment.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to save a bit of money on this purchase. Can you consider my offer?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,350,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit while you still get a fantastic deal. Let's close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,280,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you meet me at this price?",1280000.0,Bob,4,
