"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's estimated value. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Positive Messaging:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A $1,000 gap allows for some back-and-forth, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Avoiding John immediately:** I'm not going to sell to John just yet.  I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is a start, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, and potentially get a better deal than Bob's initial offer.
* **Not selling to John yet:** I have 10 rounds, so I can afford to continue negotiating with Bob without rushing to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,500 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $8,250? This is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned. "", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by proposing a middle ground price.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value he's mentioned, suggesting my counteroffer is still favorable.
* **Focus on a Deal:** The message aims to keep the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement. 
* **Not Giving in:** This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident Bob will see the value in it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Further Negotiation:** While I'm willing to compromise, I believe there's still room for a more favorable deal. 
* **Time Remaining:**  With 6 rounds left, I have time to continue negotiating.
* **John's offer is a Safety Net:**  I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, but I want to exhaust all options with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I need to be compensated for the value of this product. I'm offering you the product for $8,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my offer but maintaining a price above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he perceives in the product.
* **Creating Urgency:** I'm using the phrase ""let's see if we can reach an agreement"" to subtly imply that time is running out for negotiation.
* **Keeping the door open:** I'm leaving space for Bob to counteroffer without committing to selling to John yet."
