"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to profit, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair deal. Let's make this happen!",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000. Would that work for you?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,100,000 is still below what I can accept. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $1,200,000.  This price is fair considering the value of the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
