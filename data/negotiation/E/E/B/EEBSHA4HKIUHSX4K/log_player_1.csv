"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product might be high, but I am only willing to pay up to $15000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement within this range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get a higher price. I'll counter-offer to see if I can close the deal for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $17,500, which is still a great deal for a product of this quality.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $16000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum threshold and a fair price considering the negotiation process.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further rounds that could potentially lead to a lower price or a sale to John for $15,000."
