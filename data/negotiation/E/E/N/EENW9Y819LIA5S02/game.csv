"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  While the product is valuable to me, I'm looking to get a price closer to $650,000 to make this deal work.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $675,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, while also showing my willingness to compromise. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $675,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $660,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to get a good price.  Let's see if we can bridge this small gap.",660000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $660,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you a price of $670,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.
