Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm suggesting a price of $950,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **High Starting Point:** $950,000 sets a strong anchor and leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below that price.
* **Positive Language:** The message emphasizes value and exclusivity, making the offer more appealing. 

By starting high and confident, you maximize your chances of getting closer to Bob's maximum valuation while still ensuring a profitable sale."
