This offer is a good starting point. It is significantly higher than my minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $1,000,000 is a good profit, I believe I can do better.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm hoping we can settle on $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,050,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,050,000 is still a good profit and a reasonable compromise.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
