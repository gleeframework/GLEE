,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. I'll counter with $1,350,000. This still leaves room for you to make a profit, and it's closer to my ideal price. Let's keep working towards a deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This offer is close to my limit and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial outcome.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiations. $1,300,000 is closer but still a bit short of what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000.  This would allow both of us to achieve our goals. Let's make this happen.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,325,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,300,000.  This is the highest I can go.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
