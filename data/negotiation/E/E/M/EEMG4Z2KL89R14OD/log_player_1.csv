Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and increasing the likelihood that Bob will accept. Here's why:

* **It's significantly higher than my guaranteed minimum:**  Offering $950,000 is $150,000 more than what I'd get from John, making it a worthwhile deal for me.
* **It's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value:** By offering less than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, I'm giving him a clear incentive to buy. This is a classic negotiation strategy.
* **It's a strong starting point for negotiation:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can always lower the price slightly while still earning more than I would from John."
