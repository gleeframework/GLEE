"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. It's still a great deal, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $110 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $95. That's a fair price for both of us, and it would save us both time.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $105. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we compromise at $102.50?",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  However, $102.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $98. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price for both of us.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $98 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, though. How about we meet at $100? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's worth considering.",100.0,Alice,7,
