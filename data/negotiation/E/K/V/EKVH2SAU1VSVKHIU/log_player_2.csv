Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,750 is still a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. Considering the value the product brings, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering the product for $10,200. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $10,200. Buying from John at $10,000 saves us money and avoids further negotiation."
