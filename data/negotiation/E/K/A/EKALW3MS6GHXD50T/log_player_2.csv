{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I think the product is a good one, but I'm not willing to pay $12,000. Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm not willing to pay $10,500, but I'm willing to meet her halfway from my previous offer of $9,000. Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer. Let's try $10,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to close this deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","This is an interesting development. Alice's offer is now at $10,000, which is the same price that John is offering. I think I've squeezed her as much as I can, and it's time to consider my options. Since I've reached the price that John is offering, I'll consider buying from John instead of negotiating further with Alice.
