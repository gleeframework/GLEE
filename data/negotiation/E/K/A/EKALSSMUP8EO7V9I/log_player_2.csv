"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'd really appreciate. It's something you value at $120, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice is offering the product for $100, which is lower than your maximum willingness to pay ($120) and higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price ($80). This means you can buy the product and save $20 compared to buying from John."
