"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be very valuable for your business. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my own expenses.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $975,000. Can you consider this offer?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but we're still a bit apart on the price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, at $1,007,500. This is a very fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement.",1007500.0,Alice,7,
