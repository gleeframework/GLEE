{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.**  It's still a little higher than what you initially wanted, but it's a reasonable compromise.
* **Further negotiation may not be worth it.**  You've been able to bring the price down significantly, and continuing to haggle may risk losing the deal.
* **John's offer is a backup, but not ideal.**  While you can still buy from John, Alice's offer is a better price and avoids the risk of a potential negotiation breakdown."
