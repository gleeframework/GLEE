Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $150. It's a fantastic deal you won't want to miss!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. Starting with a higher offer allows you to potentially maximize your profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $150, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and you can then decide whether to accept, decline, or propose a different price closer to your minimum. 
* **Psychology:**  A slightly higher initial offer can create a perception of value. Even if Bob doesn't pay the full $150, it might make him more amenable to a price higher than $100."
