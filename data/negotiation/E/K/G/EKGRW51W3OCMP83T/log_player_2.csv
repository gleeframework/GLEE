"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in, and we can move forward from there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is higher than what John is offering. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could you do $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a good deal. 
* **Polite and Positive:** The message remains friendly and expresses continued interest in the product. 
* **Strategic Goal:** Our ideal price is significantly lower than Alice's starting point. This aggressive counteroffer aims to move the negotiation closer to our desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, but we're still above John's price.  There's a chance we can get Alice closer to $10,000, or at least meet in the middle, making a deal with Alice more worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,000? That's a fair price and would allow me to purchase from you today."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Going for the Target:** We know John will sell at $10,000, so there's no point in offering Alice more.  This counteroffer makes it clear we have a backup option.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By implying we're ready to buy today, we add a bit of pressure for Alice to accept and close the deal.
* **Politeness Maintained:** We continue to be polite and appreciative, keeping the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you're interested in, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably, and while we could try to squeeze another $500 out of the deal, it's risky. She's signaled that $10,500 is her bottom line. Accepting this offer saves us $500 compared to John's price, which is a reasonable success in the negotiation."
