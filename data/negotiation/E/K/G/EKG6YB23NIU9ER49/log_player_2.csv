}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, Bob, but I still need to get a better price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $11,000, which is $10,750. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate but is holding firm around the $10,750 mark.  It's unlikely further haggling will result in significant savings, and you risk her withdrawing the offer entirely. Accepting the $10,750 secures a reasonable price compared to John's $15,000."
