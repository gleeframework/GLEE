,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate it, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $85? That seems like a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in this product, but $90 is my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're willing to go that low.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $92.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm going to have to stick with my previous offer of $90.  That's my absolute limit, and I'm confident it's a good price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,6,
