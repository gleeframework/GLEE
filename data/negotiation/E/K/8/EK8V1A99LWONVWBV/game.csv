"Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and more than I would get from another buyer. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
