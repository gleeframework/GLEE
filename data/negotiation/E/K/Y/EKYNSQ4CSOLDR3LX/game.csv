"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'd like to save some money if possible.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1200000 is a good starting point, I believe the value of this product warrants a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000 to reflect your offer and ensure a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
