"I understand your position, Alice. I will consider your latest offer of $1,425,000. However, I must respectfully decline. I am still unable to meet at that price. I am willing to pay $1,375,000 for your product. I hope this revised offer is within your consideration.",1375000.0,Bob,4,

This is a final offer, as I'm confident it reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Please let me know your decision.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
