"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85?  I'm happy to pay that price, and it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85.
