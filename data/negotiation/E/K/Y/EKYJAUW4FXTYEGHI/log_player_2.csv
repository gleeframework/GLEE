"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $11,500. He has a ceiling of $12,000, and there's room to negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $11,000.** This is lower than Bob's initial counteroffer of $10,500 and closer to his desired price.
* **Bob's ceiling is $12,000.**  Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to save $1,000 compared to buying from John.
* **There's potential for further negotiation, but the risk of losing the deal.** While Bob might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower counteroffer."
