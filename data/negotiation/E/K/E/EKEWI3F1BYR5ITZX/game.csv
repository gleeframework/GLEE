"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you: I'll sell the product to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $900000. I would like to propose an alternative offer of $850000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $850000 is still a bit below my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $875000. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a final offer of $860000. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm counteroffering at $880000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me at this price. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",880000.0,Alice,5,
