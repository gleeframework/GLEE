Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price in further negotiations."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still not quite there. How about $900,000? That's a significant step closer to my budget, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident that I can get a better price, especially since I have the option to sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $900,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $925,000.
