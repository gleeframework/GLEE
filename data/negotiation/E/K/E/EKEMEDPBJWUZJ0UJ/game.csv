"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth more to you. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to buy, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $12,000?  That gives you a good deal, and I can still get a decent price. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still not there yet.  How about $11,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,4,
