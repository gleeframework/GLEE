"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I'm thinking closer to $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,100,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $700,000? ",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm motivated to find an agreement, $700,000 remains significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This offer reflects a considerable compromise on my end.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, I think we're getting closer. How about we settle at $800,000?  That's the very top of my budget.",800000.0,Bob,6,
