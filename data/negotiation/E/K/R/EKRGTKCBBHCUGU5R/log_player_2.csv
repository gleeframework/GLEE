Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,100,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm motivated to find an agreement, $700,000 remains significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This offer reflects a considerable compromise on my end.
