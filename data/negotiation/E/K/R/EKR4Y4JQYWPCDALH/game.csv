"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to buy the product for $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would be a win-win for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground.  However, $1,000,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000, recognizing your budget constraints. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement this time.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
