Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** Offering it slightly below your minimum ($119) might entice Bob while still leaving you a profit.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding ""limited time"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 
 
**Important Note:** This assumes there's no opportunity for further negotiation or counter-offers from Bob.  If that's possible, the strategy might change."
