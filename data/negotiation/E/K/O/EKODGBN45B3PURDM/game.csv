"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant amount to me, but I believe it holds even greater value for you, potentially reaching $1.5 million in your hands. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its worth, but also allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  My asking price is $1250000. This price reflects a fair compromise between our individual values, and I believe it represents a strong investment for you. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
