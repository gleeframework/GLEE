(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too expensive at $12,000.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
``` 

Bob should start by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  $7,000 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still too high. He should reject the offer and continue negotiating for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

Bob should increase his offer slightly to show that he is serious about buying the product. $7,500 is a reasonable increase from his previous offer, and still leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is getting closer to Bob's limit, he should continue negotiating to see if he can get it down to $8,000 or closer. There are still a few rounds left, so there's time to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

Bob should go for the final price he's willing to pay.  This shows Alice that he's serious and that further negotiation might not be fruitful."
