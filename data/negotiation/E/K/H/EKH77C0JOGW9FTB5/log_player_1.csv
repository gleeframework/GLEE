Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $8,000 to him, I'll aim to get as close to that as possible while still making a profit.

My offer to Bob is:
{""product_price"": $7,500}

I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $7,500, which is a $500 discount from its true value to him. This should be a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate from here."
