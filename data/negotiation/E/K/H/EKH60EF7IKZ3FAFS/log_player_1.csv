Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can aim higher with Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A starting price of $1,500,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum. 
* **Gauging interest:**  The message is framed to understand Bob's initial reaction and see if he's willing to engage in a negotiation. 
 
**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to:

* **Negotiate:** If Bob counters, be ready to adjust your price. You have some leeway, but remember your minimum.
* **Walk away:**  If Bob is unwilling to meet a price that's beneficial for you, you can always fall back on your deal with John."
