"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,3,
