Round 3

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $112.50, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price for a great product!

```

Alice is willing to go down to $112.50, which is within your budget and a good deal. It's risky to keep negotiating, as you may not get a better price, and you risk losing the opportunity altogether. You only have one round left after this one."
