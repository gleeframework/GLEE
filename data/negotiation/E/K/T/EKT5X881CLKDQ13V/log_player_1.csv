Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,900,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** While I have a guaranteed sale with John, aiming high with Bob could yield a significantly higher return. 
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a very high price ($1,900,000) sets an anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, the final price is likely to be much closer to my asking price than if I started low.
* **Scarcity:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, making Bob less likely to stall or lowball.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:** This strategy assumes Bob sees significant value in the product and might be willing to pay a premium to secure it.
* **Negotiation:** This is just the opening move. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a clear understanding of your lowest acceptable price will be crucial during negotiations."
