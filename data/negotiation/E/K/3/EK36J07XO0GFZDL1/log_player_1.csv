"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum threshold. This gives room for negotiation while still securing a good profit. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm focusing on a win-win situation, encouraging Bob to consider the offer.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Leaving some space for a counteroffer allows for a more natural negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $1,250,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,250,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I still have 9 rounds left, and I can likely secure a higher price by continuing negotiations.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000. 

**Next step:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still represents a great value for you considering the product's worth. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Still profitable:**  $1,600,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose money. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and collaborative approach to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, hoping to sway him towards a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000 for your product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the value of the product and my financial capacity. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $1,400,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While accepting the offer now, I can always try to negotiate further terms or conditions to potentially increase my final earnings. For example, I could ask for a faster payment schedule or include a small bonus tied to future performance.
* **Limited time:**  We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing for a higher price and having Bob walk away completely. 

By accepting this offer, I'm securing a profitable deal while also leaving open the possibility for additional benefits."
