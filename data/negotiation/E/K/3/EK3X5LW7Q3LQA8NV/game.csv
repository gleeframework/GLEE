"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,300,000. This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within budget.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,300,000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from my ideal price. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This gives you a substantial saving and allows me to keep the product close to my target. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
