Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute limit. If you can't agree to this, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

While I could push for more, Bob has signaled this is his absolute limit. Accepting the $1,000,000 offer is a sure gain and avoids the risk of him walking away."
