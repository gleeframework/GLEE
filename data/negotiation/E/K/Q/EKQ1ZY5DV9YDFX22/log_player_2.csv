"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  That starting price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to buy the product for $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This establishes my position and leaves room for negotiation. By aiming for $800,000, I'm trying to secure a deal well below my maximum budget of $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a fair price considering the unique benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice came down in price, but it's still far above our target and maximum budget. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,700,000 is still beyond my budget. I could consider going up to $950,000. This offer stands as a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}

**Reasoning:** 

* **Show willingness to compromise:**  By increasing the offer, we demonstrate to Alice that we are serious about purchasing the product and willing to negotiate. 
* **Stay below budget:**  The offer of $950,000 keeps us below our $1,000,000 limit, leaving a small margin for potential further negotiation. 
* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** This counteroffer will help us understand how much Alice is willing to move from her previous price and if a deal within our budget is achievable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I am motivated to sell, I do need to make a reasonable profit.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,325,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming closer to a more reasonable price, but $1,325,000 is still significantly over our budget. We'll counteroffer again, but we need to be prepared to walk away and go with John if she doesn't budge considerably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute limit. If you can't agree to this, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  This is our final offer and our absolute maximum budget. 
* **Clear and firm:** We're stating clearly that this is the best we can do, and we're prepared to walk away.
* **Time pressure:** By mentioning ""other options,"" we're subtly reminding Alice that we have the alternative of buying from John. 
* **Potential deal:** This offer represents a significant profit for Alice compared to selling to John and might be tempting enough for her to accept."
