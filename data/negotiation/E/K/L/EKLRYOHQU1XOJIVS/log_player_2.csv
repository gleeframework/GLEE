# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly exceptional. Given its value to you, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. Let me start with an offer of $9,500 for the product.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your feedback, I'm willing to adjust my offer to $8,900. This is the highest I can go while still ensuring a reasonable profit for myself. What do you think, Bob? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** The offer of $8,900 is below Bob's maximum price of $10,000.
* **Opportunity to save:**  Accepting the offer saves Bob $100 compared to buying from John.
* **Potential for a deal:** While Bob might prefer a lower price, there's no guarantee that Alice will go lower. It's likely that Alice is firm on this offer.

Given these factors, it's a good strategic move for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product at a favorable price."
