"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. We can try to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm! However, $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you be willing to consider $130? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $137.50? I think it's a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $137.50, which is still below my maximum price of $150. While I'd prefer to pay even less, this is a good compromise. It's better than going back and forth with Alice for potentially more rounds or resorting to John's offer, which is significantly higher."
