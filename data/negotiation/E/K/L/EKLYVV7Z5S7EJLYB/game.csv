"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $165. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",165.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the compromise, but $165 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $155.  This would be a fair price for both of us, I think.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $155 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $160. It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's still a fair compromise. Let me know what you think!",160.0,Alice,5,
