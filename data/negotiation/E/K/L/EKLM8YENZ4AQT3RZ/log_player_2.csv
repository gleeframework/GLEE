"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $20000 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best option to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $20,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $10000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $17000. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $17,000 is still above Bob's budget.  While it's closer to his ideal price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows Bob to try to get a lower price without risking buying from John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $13500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above Bob's budget.  While it's getting closer, Bob is determined to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again allows Bob to see if he can get an even lower price before potentially buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we try $14,500? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 14500}
