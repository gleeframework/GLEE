``` 

I'm starting with a higher price than what I know the product is worth to Bob, aiming to maximize my profit.  I'm also framing it as a great deal to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $15,000? That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about $13,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer of $13,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable threshold of $15,000. I'm going to reject this offer and make another counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,250.  That's a fair price that allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's still below what John is offering.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 14250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $14,250. How about $13,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I've already made several counteroffers.  It seems he's not willing to budge, so it's better to move on and sell the product to John for my minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
