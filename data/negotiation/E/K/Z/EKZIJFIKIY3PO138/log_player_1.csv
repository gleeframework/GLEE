Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a ""deal"" if he haggles.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will be telling. If he accepts immediately, we know we could have gone higher. If he declines, we can then counter-offer closer to our minimum.
* **Backup Plan:**  We have the security of knowing John will purchase the product for $12,000 if Bob declines, so we can be a bit more assertive in our initial offer."
