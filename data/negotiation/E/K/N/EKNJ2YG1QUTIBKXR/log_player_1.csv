"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $8,000. This will give me room to negotiate if he rejects the offer. However, I'm still leaving myself some room to close the deal if he doesn't counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000.  I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $9,500, still above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also emphasizes my belief in the product's value.  I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal, and I'm happy to accept Bob's offer. It's better than my minimum threshold and getting closer to my initial asking price. I'm not willing to risk losing the sale and potentially have to start the negotiation over with John."
