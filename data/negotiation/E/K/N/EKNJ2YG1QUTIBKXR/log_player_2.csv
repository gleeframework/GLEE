Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. $11,000 is way above your budget. You can do better by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
``` 

You are starting with a lower offer than John's price to see if Alice is willing to come down a bit. If she's not, you can always go to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $9,500 is getting closer to your budget, you're still above your ideal price point. You should continue negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a lower offer. If not, you can always go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
``` 

You're raising your offer slightly, showing that you're serious about buying the product from Alice, but still staying within your budget.  This could be a good compromise point, as it's closer to Alice's price, but still a good deal for you."
