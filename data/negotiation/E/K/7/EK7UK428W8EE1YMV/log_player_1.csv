Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,300,000 is a bit high for me.  Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is a significant profit, we're aiming for the best possible outcome. There's still room for negotiation to bridge the gap between his offer and my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you working with me. While $1,000,000 is tempting, the true value of this product is much higher. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  This reflects its worth while recognizing your initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,175,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Given the value I place on the product and our ongoing discussions, I'm willing to go to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's motivated.  We're getting closer to a price point that reflects the product's value. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. How about we settle this right now at $1,140,000? This is my final offer, reflecting a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1140000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $1,140,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I can't go above $1,050,000.  I'm confident this price is fair given the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. Let's not let this deal fall throughâ€”I'm prepared to make a final decision. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While we're still slightly below our ideal price, Bob's latest offer is quite strong, and he seems firm on his limit. Accepting $1,050,000 ensures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether by pushing further."
