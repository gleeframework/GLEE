"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This will give me a good baseline for negotiations.  I'm also leaving some room for negotiation, while still ensuring I'm above my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but not by much.  This shows Bob I'm serious about selling to him, but also that I'm not willing to drop down to his initial price. Hopefully, we can find a middle ground."
