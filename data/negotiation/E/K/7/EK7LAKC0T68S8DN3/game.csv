"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm still looking for a good price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $127. What do you think?",127.0,Alice,5,
