"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a great deal for a product that is worth no less than $1,000,000 to me.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a much higher price than what Bob is willing to pay.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product,  $1,200,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this deal worthwhile.  How about $1,050,000?  This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,050,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget.  Rejecting and continuing to negotiate might lead to a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make this worthwhile, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value for this product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a fair price, Bob can still potentially get it for less.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if Alice will budge further.  If not, buying from John is the next best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's my final offer.  If you're not comfortable with that price, I'll have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 975000}
