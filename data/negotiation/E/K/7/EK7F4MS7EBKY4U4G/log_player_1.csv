{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a great deal for a product that is worth no less than $1,000,000 to me.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product,  $1,200,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price. I'll see if I can get closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this deal worthwhile.  How about $1,050,000?  This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's the lowest I can go."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make this worthwhile, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I'm not ready to give up on getting closer to my target.  I'll see if we can bridge the gap in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value for this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's my final offer.  If you're not comfortable with that price, I'll have to look elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $975,000 is tempting, I'm running out of time and rounds.  It's clear Bob won't go any higher.  I'd rather secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
