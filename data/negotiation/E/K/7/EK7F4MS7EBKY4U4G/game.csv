"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a great deal for a product that is worth no less than $1,000,000 to me.  Let me know if you're interested!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product,  $1,200,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this deal worthwhile.  How about $1,050,000?  This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's the lowest I can go.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make this worthwhile, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value for this product. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's my final offer.  If you're not comfortable with that price, I'll have to look elsewhere.",975000.0,Bob,6,
