"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know John will pay. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob is hesitant.
* **Fairness:** While the price is high, it's not unreasonable considering the value of the product to me.
* **Open Communication:** The message is friendly and encouraging dialogue, showing I'm open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting it would be a huge loss.
* **Negotiation Room:** I still have 9 rounds to try and reach a mutually agreeable price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially bridge the gap. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is tempting, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value our potential partnership, I can't accept $1,000,000.  Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,350,000. This still allows me to make a profit while giving you a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by lowering the price from my initial offer. 
* **Middle Ground:** $1,350,000 is a middle ground between my minimum and Bob's offer, giving him room to potentially counter again.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is clear and explains the reasoning behind the counteroffer, emphasizing both my need to profit and a desire to find a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,350,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to get a good price while giving me a product within my budget.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is an increase, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  I still have 6 rounds to try and get a better price. There's room for more negotiation.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer is a safety net, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $1,100,000 doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down further, but only to $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair offer. If you're serious about acquiring the product, let's work towards this price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to compromise again, but only a small step towards Bob's offer. This keeps the pressure on him to increase his offer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that I'm still offering a valuable product.
* **Urgency:**  The message implies a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly before the deal falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  I'm still stuck at $1,100,000.  This is the very top of my budget, and I'm confident we can reach a fair deal at this price.  I'm sure you can find other ways to make up the difference elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We've reached a stalemate.  Bob is unwilling to go higher, and I'm unwilling to go lower than $1,200,000.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm not confident I can get Bob to increase his offer significantly.
* **John's Guarantee:** John's offer provides a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my minimum requirement. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I would prefer to get a higher price from Bob, the risk of continuing the negotiation with him is too high.  It's better to secure a guaranteed sale with John."
