"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something that I've valued at no less than $1,000,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that I think is fair and mutually beneficial.  Would you be interested in discussing a price of $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly motivated to sell as the product's value to her is significantly less than her asking price.
* By rejecting her offer, you signal that the price is too high. This opens the door for a counter-offer from Alice, potentially closer to her $1,000,000 valuation.
* While you could buy from John for $1,500,000, there's room to negotiate a better deal with Alice before resorting to that option."
