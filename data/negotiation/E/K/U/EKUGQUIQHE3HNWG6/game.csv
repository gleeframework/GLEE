"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product and understand its value. However, my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? I believe that would be a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget is limited. However,  $10,000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $11,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know if this works for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, my budget is very tight and I am unable to go above $10,000 for this product. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
