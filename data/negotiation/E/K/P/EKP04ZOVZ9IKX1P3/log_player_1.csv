Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob hasn't met my ideal price, this offer is significantly above my fallback option of selling to John for $1,500,000.  Continuing to push for a higher price with Bob risks him walking away entirely. Accepting the $1,700,000 secures a substantial profit."
