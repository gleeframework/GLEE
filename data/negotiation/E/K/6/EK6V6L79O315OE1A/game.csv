"Alice,  $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product,  which is still a good price for you considering your own valuation. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",14000.0,Bob,4,
