You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is way too high. You can get it from John for $12,000. It makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and counter-offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's closer to your desired price, you can still get it from John for $12,000.  It's worth another counteroffer to see if you can get a better price."
