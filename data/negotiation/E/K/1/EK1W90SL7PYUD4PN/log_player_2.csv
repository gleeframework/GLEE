"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. He has 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows for more bargaining and potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his ideal price point.  He has more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue bargaining and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not comfortable with $11,000, Bob. I'm willing to go a bit higher and offer it to you for $11,800. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $11,800 is getting closer to his ideal price point, he can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  He has 5 more rounds to go before he has to buy from John, so he should try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,800 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $11,400. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for the product's value."", ""product_price"": 11400}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $11,400. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,700. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has only 3 rounds left before he has to buy from John for a much higher price. While $11,700 is still a bit above his ideal price point, it's a good deal compared to buying from John.  Accepting the offer ensures that Bob gets the product at a price that's significantly lower than John's offer, and it allows him to avoid further negotiation that may not result in a better price."
