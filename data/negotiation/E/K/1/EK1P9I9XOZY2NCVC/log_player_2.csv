"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me and still leaves you with a significant profit. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000?  This would still leave you with a significant profit, and it would be a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work.
