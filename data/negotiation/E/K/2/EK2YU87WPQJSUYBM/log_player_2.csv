"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm asking for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $15,000 and John's offer of $15,000.  There's room for negotiation."
