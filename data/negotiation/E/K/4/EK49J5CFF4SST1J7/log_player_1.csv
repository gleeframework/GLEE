Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested, while still securing a profit above your minimum.
* **Create Urgency:**  The phrase ""limited time"" might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 

**Important Note:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, you're still securing your minimum acceptable price with John."
