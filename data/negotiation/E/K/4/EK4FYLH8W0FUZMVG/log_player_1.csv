Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **The Message:**  A friendly and persuasive message encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still giving Bob an incentive to buy. If he rejects, I'm confident I can sell to John for my desired price."
