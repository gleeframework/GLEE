I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $145."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135

Bob's offer of $135 is a good compromise, and it's closer to my desired price than John's offer.  I'm going to accept it."
