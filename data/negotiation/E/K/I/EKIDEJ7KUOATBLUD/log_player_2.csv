$25,000 is way over your budget. It's better to try negotiating with Alice or go to John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

$22,000 is still too high. I will try to get a lower price from Alice."

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the last round, showing willingness to negotiate while still staying within my budget. Hopefully, this will encourage Alice to come down further."
