"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $2000000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's a good starting point for negotiation, but we need to bring the price down.  Rejecting the offer allows us to start a counter-offer process, aiming to get a price closer to our $1,000,000 limit."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the potential value of this product, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a substantial investment. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $1000000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower the price to $1750000. This reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that offers value for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is a step in the right direction, but it's still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 and I believe further negotiation can bring us closer to that price.  Rejecting the offer will allow us to make another counteroffer, hopefully finding a middle ground."
