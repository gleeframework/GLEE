Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $145."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $145 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you. If Bob rejects this offer, you can still fall back on John's offer of $120. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best possible price and ensuring a successful sale."
