"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $2,000,000 for the product. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it, which is still a significant premium considering its value to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It shows you're serious about this product.  While I value your interest, the $1,800,000 price point doesn't quite reflect the full potential this product holds. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This would still be a fantastic deal for you, considering the value you'll gain.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll propose $1,700,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to considering other options.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. You clearly see the value in this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. However, $1,700,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  If we can settle on $1,800,000, I'm prepared to finalize the deal today. This offer reflects my strong desire to see this product in your capable hands.",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your desire to finalize the deal, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer, so I'll propose $1,750,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to considering other options, including John's offer.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
