Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It shows you're serious about this product.  While I value your interest, the $1,800,000 price point doesn't quite reflect the full potential this product holds. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This would still be a fantastic deal for you, considering the value you'll gain.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. You clearly see the value in this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.
