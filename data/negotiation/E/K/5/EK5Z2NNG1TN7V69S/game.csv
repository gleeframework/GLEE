"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price more around $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,350,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
