Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $10,000, knowing that it's likely higher than Bob's initial valuation. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to be flexible, making Bob more likely to engage in a conversation.
* **Asking for Thoughts:**  I'm prompting Bob to share his initial thoughts, allowing me to gauge his interest and potential counteroffer. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between setting a high initial price and remaining open to finding a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer matches the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that I'll be able to get a higher price.  Selling to John immediately guarantees me the minimum value I'm comfortable with, avoiding any potential risk of further negotiation."
