"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a truly unique item with a lot of potential value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profits.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $15,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum, but leaves room for Bob to counteroffer.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product to pique Bob's interest.

**Note:** This is just the first offer. I'll adjust my strategy depending on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation:** I want to try to get closer to my ideal price.
* **I have more rounds to negotiate:** I'm not desperate to sell right now, so I can afford to be a bit more firm.
* **I'm confident in the value of my product:** I believe it's worth more than $12,000, and I'm willing to keep negotiating.

**Next Move:** I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'll aim for a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $12,000 is a good starting point, I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $13,500? I believe that's a fair compromise given the product's value."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not give in completely.
* **Fair Value:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation open and avoid turning Bob off. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make another counteroffer based on his response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12750. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $12,750 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** We are already in Round 4, leaving fewer rounds for negotiation. There's a risk of reaching a stalemate.
* **Potential for future deals:**  Even though I'm accepting this offer, it's a good starting point for future negotiations with Bob if he becomes a repeat customer.

**Next Steps:**

I'm satisfied with this outcome, and I'm ready to close the deal with Bob."
