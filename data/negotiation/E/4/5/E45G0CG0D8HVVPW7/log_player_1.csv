Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price enticing enough for Bob to accept, exceeding his perceived value without going below your guaranteed amount. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Target Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It's comfortably above Bob's perceived value but still leaves you with a significant profit beyond your guaranteed amount.
* **Messaging:** The message emphasizes the product's ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" to justify the price. 
* **Flexibility:** Be prepared to negotiate slightly downward if Bob pushes back, but don't go below $1,500,000. You have a strong alternative with John.

**Important Note:**  This assumes you have no time constraints. In a time-sensitive situation, you might offer a lower price to ensure a quicker sale to Bob."
