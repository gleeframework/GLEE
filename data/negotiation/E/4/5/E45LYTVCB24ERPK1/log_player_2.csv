Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not at my target. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is the lowest I can go. If you're serious about the product, I think this is a fair price. Can you meet me there?

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has consistently rejected offers below $13,000. It's highly unlikely she'll go down to a price that works for you (below $12,600) in the last round. You can get the product for $10,000 from John, which is a much better deal. It makes sense to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed savings."
