Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with a price higher than your minimum. This provides room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher price.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While the product is only worth $8,000 to Bob, starting at $12,000 creates the impression of value and leaves space for Bob to counter-offer within a range that could still be very profitable for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be forced to accept a low offer from Bob. This allows you to be firmer in your negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he outright rejects $12,000, you can gradually reduce your asking price while gauging his reactions and trying to understand his budget limitations."
