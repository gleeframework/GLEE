{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still securing a price higher than my minimum acceptable value. I'm aiming for a price closer to the midpoint between my minimum and Bob's estimated value, hoping to get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, it's still below my ideal price point. I believe I can push for a higher price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to go up to $10,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider meeting me at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is very close to my ideal price point and significantly higher than selling to John. While I could try for a higher price, the risk of losing the deal altogether and having to settle for John's offer is too high. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit and secures the sale."
