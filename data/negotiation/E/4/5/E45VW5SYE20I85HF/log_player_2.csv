I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.

While Alice's offer is less than John's, it's still significantly higher than your maximum price and Alice's valuation. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal and increase your chances of getting the product for a lower price."
