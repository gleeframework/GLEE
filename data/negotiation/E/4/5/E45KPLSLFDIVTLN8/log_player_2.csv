"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Since the product is worth $15,000 to you, you can definitely do better than $12,000. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to negotiate a lower price."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the market value and my initial offer. What do you think?
