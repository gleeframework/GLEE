"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially get a good price.  I also want to see if he's serious about buying at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. Bob is showing interest, and I want to see if I can push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer but still keeping it above Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while maintaining my stance that the product is worth more than $950,000.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm also considering the risk of losing Bob completely and having to settle for John's offer, which is $1 million, but that's only $100,000 more than Bob's current offer. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value. This offer shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving in completely. It's a gamble, but I believe that if I can get Bob to agree to this price, I'll still have a good outcome. I also want to see how far he's willing to go.  If he rejects, I'll have to make a decision about whether to accept his next offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not convinced it's the best I can get. There are still a few rounds left, and I want to see if I can push him a little further. I'm also considering the fact that selling to John would only be $75,000 more. However, the risk of losing Bob altogether is still high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

This is my final offer. I'm essentially meeting Bob halfway at this point. If he rejects, I will be forced to sell to John. It's a risk, but I'm hoping that the pressure of a potential lost deal and the nearness to my minimum acceptable price will convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob is too high. Bob's offers are not significantly higher than John's offer, and I'm running out of time to secure a better deal.  Selling to John ensures a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is close enough to my desired price and eliminates the risk of losing both Bob and John."
