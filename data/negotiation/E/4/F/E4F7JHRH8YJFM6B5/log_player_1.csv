"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $95. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm countering with a price of $105. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $95.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price, but I'm also acknowledging Bob's willingness to negotiate."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $92 is getting closer to my desired price, I still want to see if I can squeeze out a little more. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm countering with a price of $100.  This is a small compromise from my previous offer of $105, but it's still above Bob's last offer of $92.  I'm trying to meet him halfway and see if he's willing to close the deal at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. It's getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not ready to sell just yet. There are still a few rounds left, and I'm hoping I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
```

I'm countering with a price of $98. This is a small compromise from my previous offer of $100, but it's still above Bob's last offer of $90. I'm hoping this offer will be enticing enough for Bob to close the deal, as we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Although Bob's offer of $88 is only slightly above John's offer of $80, I'm going to accept it.  We're down to the last few rounds, and I don't want to risk losing a deal entirely by being too stubborn.  It's better to secure a profit of $8 than risk getting nothing at all."
