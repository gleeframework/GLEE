{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $9,500 is now the same as his offer in round 2. 
* I'm choosing to accept it because:
    * I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price ($8,000). 
    * There are only 4 rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. 
    * Accepting this offer ensures I get a better price than selling to John. 
* Although I could continue negotiating, the risk of Bob walking away or not improving his offer is higher than the potential gains of a few hundred dollars."
