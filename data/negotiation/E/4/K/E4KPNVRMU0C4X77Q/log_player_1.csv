Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm willing to let it go for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer starts high, giving me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while also keeping the value of the product above my minimum.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is better than my minimum of $80, I'm not willing to give up a significant amount of profit.  I'll try to negotiate with Bob to see if I can get closer to my initial offer of $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $75 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $85?  That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $77.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $77.50 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  John is a guaranteed sale at $80, and I don't want to risk losing out on that for a slight increase in price from Bob."
