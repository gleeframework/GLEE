"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know its value is higher.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While you could reject Alice's offer hoping for a lower price, it's risky. You know you can get the product for $15,000 from John. Accepting Alice's offer saves you $1,000, which is a guaranteed saving."
