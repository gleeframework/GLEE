"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $850,000 is too low for me.  Would you consider $1,025,000? This offer represents a significant discount from my initial asking price.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,025,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, my absolute floor on this is $975,000.  This is a significant price reduction, and I'm only willing to go this low because I believe in the value this product will bring you.  Let me know if this works for you.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but  $975,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $960,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",960000.0,Bob,6,
