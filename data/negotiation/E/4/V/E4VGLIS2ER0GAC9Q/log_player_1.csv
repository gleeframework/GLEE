Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

This is my opening offer to Bob. I'm aiming for a price above my minimum of $1,500,000, knowing that the product is worth that much to him. This gives us room to negotiate, and I believe $1,750,000 is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to compromise. It also leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still too far below my minimum price. While $1,450,000 is better than his previous offer, it's still not worth risking further negotiation. Selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures I get my minimum value and avoids the possibility of a lower price with Bob."
