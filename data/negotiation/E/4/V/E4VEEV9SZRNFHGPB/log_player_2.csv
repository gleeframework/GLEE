Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $1100000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. Let me know if you're interested!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'd like to add a bit more value to the deal. I can include a premium service package that's worth $20000, which would bring the total price to $1070000. This way, you'll get the product and the added benefits, and I'll still be getting a good price for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to Bob's last counteroffer and includes an additional service package, adding value to the deal.  While the extra service package might not be essential, the price is within Bob's budget and represents a good deal compared to buying from John.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price with potential additional benefits."
