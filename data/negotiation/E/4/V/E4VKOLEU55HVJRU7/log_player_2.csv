Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has great potential, that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $600,000?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about we try $900,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $950,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's getting close to my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is stuck above $900,000 and consistently moving towards her initial offer. It's unlikely she'll drop to a price I find acceptable within the remaining rounds. Buying from John for $800,000 is the best option to ensure I stay within budget."
