"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's get started with a serious offer: I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product has great potential, that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about we try $900,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $700,000?  That feels like a fair deal to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $950,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's getting close to my minimum price.",950000.0,Alice,5,
