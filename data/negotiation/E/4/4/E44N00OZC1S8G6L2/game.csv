"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,500 is closer to my budget, I still believe we could reach a more mutually beneficial agreement.
