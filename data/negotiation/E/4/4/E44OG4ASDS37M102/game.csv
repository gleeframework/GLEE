"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $12,000. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to spend closer to $10,000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $11,000? That's a fair compromise, and we can close the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250. It's a small increase, but it's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
