"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $11,000. Can we meet in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value this product brings.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9800.0,Bob,4,
