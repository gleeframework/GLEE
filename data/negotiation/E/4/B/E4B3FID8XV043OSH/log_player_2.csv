"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is a decent price, you know you have a backup option at $120. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price to avoid losing the sale."
