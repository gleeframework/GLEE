"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique and valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product. However,  I'm going to need to come in a bit lower than $950,000.  I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further negotiations. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and the value I place on it. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high at $925,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference and settle on $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us, and I'm sure we can both walk away happy.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'm counteroffering at $920,000. This price still reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
