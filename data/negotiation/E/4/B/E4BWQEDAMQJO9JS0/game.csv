,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $110 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $85? I'm really hoping to make this work.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really hoping to close this deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
