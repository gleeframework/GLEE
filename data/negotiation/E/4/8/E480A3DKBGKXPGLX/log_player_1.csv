Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm proposing a price of $140. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You'll sell to John for $100 if Bob refuses, so that's your fallback.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want a price as close to $150 as possible without going over, to maximize your profit. Offering $140 gives Bob a small discount while still netting you a significant gain over selling to John."
