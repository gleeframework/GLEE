{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a good price for me.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by setting a price that's higher than my minimum but still potentially attractive to Bob. It also leaves room for negotiation, suggesting a willingness to compromise.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit lower. How about $10,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, but I don't want to sell it to John for $10,000 yet.  I'm going to counter with a price that's closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,200. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to what I'm looking for. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is a fair compromise, and it's significantly higher than John's offer of $10,000. I'm going to accept this offer and finalize the deal with Bob."
