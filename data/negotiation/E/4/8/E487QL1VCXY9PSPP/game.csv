"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $950,000? That's still a great price for a product worth so much to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit on the price.  While I see the value in your product, I'm afraid $950,000 is still pushing it for my budget.  Would you consider $900,000?  That's the highest I can go.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit away. How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000?  I'm confident you'll find the product's value well worth that price.",925000.0,Alice,5,
