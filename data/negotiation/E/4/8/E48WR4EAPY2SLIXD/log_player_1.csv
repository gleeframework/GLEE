Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $99."", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $100 as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $100 (John), I don't want to go below that.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $80, so I need to offer a price that's appealing but still profitable for me.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I start at $99, there's a slight chance Bob might try to negotiate a bit lower. This leaves a small buffer while still aiming for the highest possible price."
