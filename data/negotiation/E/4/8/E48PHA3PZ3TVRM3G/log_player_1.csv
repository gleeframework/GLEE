"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident the product is worth more to Bob than $1,000,000, so this initial offer gives us a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, it's still below my initial goal. I believe there's potential to get a better price, so I'll reject this offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm adjusting my price down slightly from the initial offer, but still leaving room for profit.  I want to show flexibility, but I'm also not willing to go too low this early in the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,150,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I believe Bob is still willing to pay more, so I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer again to $1,300,000. This is getting closer to Bob's last offer and shows I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. With only four rounds remaining, I'm going to risk it and try to get a higher price by counteroffering. I believe Bob is still interested in the product and might be willing to increase his offer a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer again to $1,250,000.  This shows that I'm serious about wanting to sell the product to Bob, but I'm also firm on getting a price that's closer to my initial goal.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation, so it's time to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,075,000 is only slightly above my minimum, I'm not willing to settle yet. With only two rounds left, I'm going to risk it and counteroffer one more time.  I believe there's still a chance to get a better price, and I don't want to regret settling for a lower amount so close to the end."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's still a fair price for both of us.  With only one round left, it's time to see if Bob is willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is only slightly lower than my minimum, I'm not willing to take the risk of rejecting it and losing the deal.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a sale and secures my minimum profit.  I've learned that even with good negotiating skills, sometimes it's best to accept a reasonable offer and move on."
