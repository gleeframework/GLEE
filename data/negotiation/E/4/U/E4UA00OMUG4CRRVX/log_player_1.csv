Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy Alice should use, followed by the offer:

**Strategy**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential back-and-forth if Bob wants to negotiate. 
* **Consider the Alternative:** Alice has a guaranteed $10,000 from John, so any offer to Bob should be above that.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe this price reflects its true value and the benefits it will bring you."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $11,500 is a strong starting point, aiming to capture a significant portion of the value Bob sees in the product.
* **Polite and Professional Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing value rather than just the price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  While the offer is firm, the tone leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he wishes. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $11,500. He might try to negotiate a lower price. Alice needs to decide her walk-away point â€“ the lowest price she'll accept before selling to John."
