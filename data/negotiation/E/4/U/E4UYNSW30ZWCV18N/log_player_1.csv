Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price by continuing negotiations.  $850,000 is still significantly below what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. The product offers significant value to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $900,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  To show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to drop my price to $925,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value the product brings to you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've gone back and forth for a few rounds, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum price.  I'm running out of time, and it's becoming increasingly unlikely that I'll get a price I'm happy with. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
