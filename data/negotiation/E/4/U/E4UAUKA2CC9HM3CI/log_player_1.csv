**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly unwilling to meet my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a strong chance he won't go above $990,000. Accepting his current offer would mean losing out on a significant amount of money. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
