Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you want to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification for price:** By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's value to someone with ""Bob's expertise,"" you create a rationale for the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The phrase ""Let me know your thoughts"" opens the door for Bob to counter-offer, giving you a chance to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price that's still significantly higher than your alternative offer.

This approach maximizes your potential earnings while maintaining a professional and persuasive tone."
