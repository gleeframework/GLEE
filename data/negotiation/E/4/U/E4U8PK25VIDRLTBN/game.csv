"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you acknowledging the value to me. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to sell at $8,500. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it a great investment.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $8,500. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can close the deal at that point.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your commitment to a fair deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll offer it to you for $9,250. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it a great investment.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer to a deal.  However, $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our last offers and offer $8,750. This is a fair price and I believe we can finally agree.",8750.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'll offer it to you for $9,100. This is still a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000.",9100.0,Alice,7,
