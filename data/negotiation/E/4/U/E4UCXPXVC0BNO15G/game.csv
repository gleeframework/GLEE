"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can meet you halfway, though. My revised offer is $825,000. I think this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget.  Could you do $760,000? I believe that would be a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, $760,000 is still a bit below my target. I can do $795,000, which is closer to my minimum price. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can get a deal done.",795000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle at $780,000?",780000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $780,000. I can do $795,000, but I'm not budging any further. I think this is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you. Let's finalize the deal at this price.",795000.0,Alice,7,
