Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can meet you halfway, though. My revised offer is $825,000. I think this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, $760,000 is still a bit below my target. I can do $795,000, which is closer to my minimum price. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can get a deal done.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $780,000. I can do $795,000, but I'm not budging any further. I think this is a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you. Let's finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice seems firm on her price of $795,000 and is unlikely to budge significantly. At this point, it's more beneficial to cut your losses and buy from John for $800,000.  You'll only be spending $5,000 more than Alice's last offer and avoid the risk of further prolonged negotiations."
