Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, though, and I'd be happy to pay $75 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my minimum of $80.  I'll try a counteroffer in the next round."
