"Alice, your product looks interesting, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $13500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a little out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12500. This is my final offer, as I can always get the product from John for $12000.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12500. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $13000. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for what you'll be getting.",13000.0,Alice,5,
