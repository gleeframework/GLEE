Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Confident but Fair:** The message aims to convey the product's value and justify the price without being overly aggressive. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
