,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $15000 for it.  What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $20000?",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $20000 is still above my price point.  Let's try $18000. This is the absolute maximum I can offer.",18000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you've made a serious offer, but I'm still not sure I can meet you at $18000. How about we compromise at $22000?",22000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $22000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $19000, but that's my final offer.  If that doesn't work, I'll need to consider other options.",19000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $19000, but I'm not sure I'm willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one final offer: $21000. This is my last concession, so I hope you'll consider it",21000.0,Alice,7,
