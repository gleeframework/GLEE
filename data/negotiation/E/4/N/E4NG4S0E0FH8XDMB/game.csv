,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $100. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is significantly below what this product is worth to me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $140 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120. That's a fair price considering what you're asking and what I'm willing to pay. Let's find a compromise.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $120 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $130?  It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can both be happy with it.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $125?  Let's close this deal and both be happy with the outcome.",125.0,Bob,6,
