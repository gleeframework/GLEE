"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. My asking price is $180. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

This product is worth $150 to Alice, and she's asking $180. That's too much for you. You're aiming for $80 or less, so rejecting her offer is the best first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's price, but it still leaves room for negotiation. Hopefully, Alice will be willing to budge a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is significantly below what this product is worth to me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still above your target price, and you have several rounds left to negotiate.  It's worth pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $140 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120. That's a fair price considering what you're asking and what I'm willing to pay. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $120 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $130?  It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can both be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You're still above your target price of $80. While Alice is coming down, it's worth pushing for a bit lower. You have more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $125?  Let's close this deal and both be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 125}
