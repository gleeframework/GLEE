Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm asking for $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting with a price of $1,000,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit margin. 
* **Confident language:**  Using phrases like ""significant value"" and ""worthwhile investment"" reinforces the product's worth in Bob's mind.
* **Direct and clear:** The message avoids being overly salesy and gets straight to the point, making it easier for Bob to respond.

**Important Note:**  While John is a guaranteed sale at $800,000, there's potential to earn significantly more from Bob. This strategy aims to maximize potential profit."
