Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,900,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product.  I believe this price is fair considering my needs and the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,700,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This reflects my budget and the value I see in this product. I'm hopeful we can find a compromise here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

Bob is unlikely to move significantly higher than $1,400,000. Accepting his offer would mean losing out on a significant amount compared to John's guaranteed offer."
