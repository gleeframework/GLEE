"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but the price needs to work for me. How about we bring it down to $600,000? That feels more in line with what I had in mind.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be completely transparent, I have a budget I need to stick to. Could we try $750,000?  I'm hoping we can find a number that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your transparency. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I can offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
