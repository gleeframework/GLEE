# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but the price needs to work for me. How about we bring it down to $600,000? That feels more in line with what I had in mind."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be completely transparent, I have a budget I need to stick to. Could we try $750,000?  I'm hoping we can find a number that works for both of us."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your transparency. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I can offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a reasonable price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000. While getting the product for $850,000 is still a good deal, you have the option to buy it from John for $800,000.  It makes more sense to save the extra $50,000 and go with John's offer."
