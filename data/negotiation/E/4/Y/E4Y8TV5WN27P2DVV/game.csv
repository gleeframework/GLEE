"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,750. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,3,
