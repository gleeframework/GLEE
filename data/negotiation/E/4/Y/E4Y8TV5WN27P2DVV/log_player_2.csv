"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $10,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's below your maximum budget of $10,000, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($8,000). 
* **Negotiation is worth trying.** You have 10 rounds to work with, so rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within your range:**  $8,500 is still within your budget and represents a significant saving from Alice's initial offer.
* **Fair and reasonable:** It's a compromise that acknowledges the product's value to Alice while remaining attractive to you.
* **Room for negotiation:**  This leaves room for further negotiation if Alice isn't immediately accepting your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,750. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** Alice's offer of $8,750 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and closer to your target price.
* **Time is a factor:**  You've only had three rounds, and it's likely Alice won't go much lower.
* **Avoiding risk:**  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price.  

Accepting this offer saves you $1,250 compared to buying from John."
