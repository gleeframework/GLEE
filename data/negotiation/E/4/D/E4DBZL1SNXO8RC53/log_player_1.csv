"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

At this point, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value of $12,000. However, it's still not worth the risk of continuing negotiations.  It's better to sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
