"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However,  $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit margin for both of us. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
