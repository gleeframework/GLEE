"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than our maximum price. We should try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for offering, Alice!  That's a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay significantly less than Alice's asking price and even our maximum budget. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  We're expressing interest while clearly stating our budget limitations. This keeps the negotiation going without being confrontational."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While Alice came down, $130 is still above our ideal price and our starting offer likely left her room to move further. 
* **John as Backup:**  We have the safety net of John's offer ($150) if negotiations with Alice completely stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $130 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're proposing a classic compromise that seems fair. It shows willingness to negotiate while sticking close to our target price.
* **Direct Approach:** By directly suggesting $120, we're making it clear this is a price point we're serious about.  
* **Time Consideration:** Each round is a chance for the deal to fall through, so we're becoming a bit more direct to signal our interest while time remains."
