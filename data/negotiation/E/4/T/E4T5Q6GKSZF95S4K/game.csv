"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate it, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,800.  However, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to go up to $10,600 for the product.  It's fair for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal at this price.",10600.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,700. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'd be happy to sell it to John for $12,000.",10700.0,Alice,5,
