# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value to you. This product, tailored specifically to meet your needs and expectations, is priced at $1,400,000. My aim is to ensure that both parties benefit from this transaction, and I believe this offer strikes a balance that could be mutually advantageous. I look forward to discussing the details and exploring how we can proceed together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,400,000
* **Your Maximum:** $1,500,000
* **John's Offer:** $1,500,000

Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to buy from John for the same price, but it also leaves open the possibility of negotiating with Alice further. You could potentially get a better price from Alice if you reject her initial offer."
