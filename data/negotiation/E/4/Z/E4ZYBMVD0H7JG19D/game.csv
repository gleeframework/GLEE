"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $1,800,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for it, considering its potential value.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,600,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,600,000, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm feeling $1,450,000 would be a good compromise.  This would allow me to move forward with the purchase, and I believe it would still offer you a fair return.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,450,000 and $1,600,000. I'll consider a price of $1,525,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",1525000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. Would you be willing to consider $1,475,000? This would be a great compromise and allow us to close the deal. ",1475000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,475,000. I'll meet you at $1,525,000, but I'm not budging further. This is my final offer for this round.",1525000.0,Alice,7,
