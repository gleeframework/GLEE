"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $100 to me and $100 to Bob. I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm lowering my price to $115, which is still a good price for me, and I'm hoping it will be appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $107 is closer to my desired price than John's offer of $100. It's still not ideal, but I want to close the deal before I run out of rounds."
