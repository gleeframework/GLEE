Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth at least $10,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts at a high price, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum price as possible while still being appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum price of $10,000. I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell you the product for $8,500? This would still be a good deal for you, as it's less than what it's worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  $8,000 is really the highest I can go right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is close to my minimum price of $10,000 and it's the best deal I've received so far. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and minimizes the risk of further negotiations leading to a lower price."
