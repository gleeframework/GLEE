"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. It's worth a lot to me, but I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $15,000.
* Alice is offering it for $14,000.
* You can get it for $15,000 from John. 

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above your maximum value.  Rejecting the offer means you can buy from John, spending $1,000 more but staying within your budget."
