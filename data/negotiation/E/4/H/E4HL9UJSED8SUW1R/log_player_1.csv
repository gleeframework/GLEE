Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't go below her minimum price of $10,000."
