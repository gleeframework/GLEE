""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit for a quick and easy sale."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to haggle you down. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The phrase ""willing to negotiate a bit"" signals to Bob that you're open to lowering the price, potentially encouraging him to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** Mentioning ""significant value"" subtly hints at the product's worth, even though Bob might value it less. 
* **Alternative in Mind:**  While you have a backup buyer, you don't want to rely on them entirely. This offer aims to secure a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than his perceived value."
