"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Given its unique nature and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,200,000."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential counter-offer. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing specifics, aiming to pique Bob's interest and justify the high initial price.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:** If Bob accepts, I secure a price much higher than both my minimum and his valuation.
2. **Gather Information:** Bob's counter-offer will reveal more about how much he values the product, helping me strategize for the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is tempting, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Accepting now would mean leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table.  It's early in the negotiation, and I'm willing to counter in hopes of closing a deal closer to $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the price.  However,  the value this product brings is truly unique and  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counter-offer aims to appear fair while still pushing for a higher price. By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" I'm implying flexibility and willingness to compromise, which can be a good negotiation tactic.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to subtly shift his perception of a fair price upwards.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Secure a Higher Price:** I'm aiming to close the deal at a point significantly higher than Bob's initial offer while still leaving some room for potential further negotiation if needed.
2. **Maintain Momentum:**  The counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving forward and avoids getting stuck in a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the value you're placing on the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,900,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has steadily increased his offer, and we're now at $1,900,000. This is a significant profit above my minimum ($1,500,000). While I could potentially push for a bit more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk that Bob might not budge much further, or the negotiation could stall. Accepting now secures a very favorable deal and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
