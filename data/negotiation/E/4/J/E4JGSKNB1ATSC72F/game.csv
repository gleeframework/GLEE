"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,300,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this price is still a good value for the product and its benefits.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. Considering the value of the product to me, and the need for a fair deal, I'm willing to offer $1,150,000.  This represents a significant step forward from my previous offer, and I believe it's a realistic starting point for us to find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

I believe this price still represents a good value for the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not quite there yet. To bridge the gap and finalize a deal, I'm willing to offer $1,175,000. This represents a significant step forward for me, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
