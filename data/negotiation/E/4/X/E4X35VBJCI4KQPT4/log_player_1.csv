Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, which is a significant markup from my minimum price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, hoping to build rapport and make Bob more open to the offer.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in the negotiation and provides an opening for him to either accept or counteroffer."
