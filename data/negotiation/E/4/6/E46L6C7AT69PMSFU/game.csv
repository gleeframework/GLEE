"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to around $10000? I believe that would be a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm afraid $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $17500. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, I am still looking to keep my spending within my budget. Would it be possible to further reduce the price to $15000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking to keep your spending within your budget, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $19000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still aiming to keep my expenses within my set budget. Could we possibly agree on a price of $16000? I believe this would be a reasonable compromise for both parties involved.",16000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still trying to stay within your budget, but I'm starting to think that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $18500. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",18500.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budgetary constraints. However, I am still aiming to keep my expenses within my set limits. Could we possibly agree on a price of $17000? I believe this would be a reasonable compromise for both parties involved.",17000.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I've already offered you a price that's below my minimum, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't meet in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $20000, but I'm not going to budge from this price. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",20000.0,Alice,9,
