Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $800,000, I know the product is worth significantly more to me. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $800,000 is too far below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This reflects the value of the product and still leaves room for you to make a profit. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1700000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring your product.

``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is still significantly below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1200000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution.

Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. It's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm not convinced Bob is willing to go any higher. I'm not willing to settle for a price below my minimum threshold, and John is offering me a guaranteed price that meets my requirements."
