"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and your potential return, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $14,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm happy to pay $12,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob is aiming to get as close to his maximum budget as possible. He knows the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so he's starting his counteroffer at the midpoint. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Offering $12,500 is a significant enough discount to pique Alice's interest, but it still leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective.  While I believe the product is worth more than that, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying within Budget:**  $13,250 is still slightly above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate. Bob can try to bring the price down further. 
* **Counteroffer Potential:** Bob has room to counteroffer with a price closer to his target, without risking the deal falling through completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $13,250 is still a bit higher than I can go.  Let's split the difference and go with $13,000.  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Close to Target:**  $13,000 is the closest Bob can get to his maximum budget without exceeding it. 
* **Compromise Signal:** By splitting the difference, Bob shows he's willing to compromise while still pushing for a better price.
* **Negotiation Advantage:** Alice has already lowered her price once, and this counteroffer puts the pressure on her to decide if she's willing to accept a price closer to Bob's target."
