"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,500 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. Could we do $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground. $11,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This is my final offer, as it's the same price I could get elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,5,
