"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I hoped, I'm willing to move closer to your price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000?  This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1,850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I think we can do better. How about we try $1,700,000? That's still a good price for the product, and it's closer to my target budget.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  $1,700,000 is a significant step closer, but I can't go that low.  My final offer is $1,775,000. This is a very competitive price, and I need to prioritize getting a fair return on this asset. ",1775000.0,Alice,5,
