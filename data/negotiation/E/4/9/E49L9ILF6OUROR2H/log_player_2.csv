Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000.

Reason: While Alice is coming down in price, she is unlikely to reach my $8,000 limit. It's better to secure the product at a known good price from John than to risk further negotiation with Alice."
