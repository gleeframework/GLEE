"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $5,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you do $7,000? That would be a fair price for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",9500.0,Alice,5,
