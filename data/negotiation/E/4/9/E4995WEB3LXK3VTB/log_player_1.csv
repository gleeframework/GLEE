Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise. I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, it's always best to try and get the highest price possible.
* **Understanding Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $800,000 to Bob. Offering it slightly below your guaranteed price creates a strong incentive for him to buy.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is $950,000, there might be a slight wiggle room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a price significantly higher than his valuation while still keeping your guaranteed option open."
