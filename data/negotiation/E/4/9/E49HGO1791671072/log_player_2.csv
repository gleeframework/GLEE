"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  To be fair to both of us, I can go as low as $815,000.  This is my final offer, as I already have a standing offer at a similar price.

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Savings:** You'll be buying the product for $815,000, saving $185,000 off John's price.
* **Finality:** Alice has indicated this is her final offer. Pushing further risks losing the deal altogether.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Negotiating further is unlikely to yield significant savings. 

While you could try another counteroffer, the potential savings aren't worth the risk of Alice walking away."
