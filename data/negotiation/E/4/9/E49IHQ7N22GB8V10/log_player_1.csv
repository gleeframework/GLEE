Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, accepting Bob's offer of $130 is the best decision. Here's why:

* **Profit:** You'll make a $10 profit over your minimum selling price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away. John's offer guarantees only $120. 

While you might be able to squeeze a few more dollars out of Bob, it's not worth the risk of losing a sale that's already profitable.
