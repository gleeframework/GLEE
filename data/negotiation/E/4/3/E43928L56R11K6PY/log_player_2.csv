"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's first offer is a good sign she's willing to negotiate down from her initial price. There's room to counter-offer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to:

* **Be polite and express continued interest:**  Maintaining a good rapport can lead to smoother negotiation.
* **Substantially lower the price:**  Starting with a lower offer leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Provide a reason:**  Giving a reason, even if simple, can make the counter-offer seem more reasonable."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $800,000. This way, we can both feel comfortable with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to a more agreeable price, there's still room for negotiation. We started quite low, so continuing to counter-offer could yield a better final price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

This counter-offer aims to:

* **Acknowledge progress:** Recognizing Alice's movement on price can encourage further negotiation.
* **Propose a specific compromise:**  Meeting ""in the middle"" can feel like a fair solution to both parties.
* **Maintain a polite and positive tone:**  Continuing to foster a positive interaction can be beneficial."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think the product is worth more than $750,000. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling that this is her final offer. While we could try to negotiate further, the potential gains are small, and we risk pushing Alice away entirely. Accepting at $775,000 secures a significant discount from both her initial price and John's offer."
