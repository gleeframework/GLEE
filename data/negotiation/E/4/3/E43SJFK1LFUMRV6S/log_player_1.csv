Bob's offer:

You have three options:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I would like to stick to my original budget. Could you possibly lower the price to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is now trying to lowball you and it's unlikely he'll go above $100.  It's time to cut your losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
