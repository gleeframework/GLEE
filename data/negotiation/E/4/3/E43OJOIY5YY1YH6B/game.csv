"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,100,000 falls short of what I consider fair compensation.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle on $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, but I need to stay within my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but the reality is this product is very valuable to me.  I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,225,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products and the value I'll get from this product.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
