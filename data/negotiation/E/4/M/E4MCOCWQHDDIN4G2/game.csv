"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save even more. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair price considering the opportunity for both of us. ",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save more, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
