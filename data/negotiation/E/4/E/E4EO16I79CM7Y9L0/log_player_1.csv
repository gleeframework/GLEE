Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob.  This gives you some room to negotiate if Bob wants a lower price. It also shows you're willing to be flexible, making him more likely to consider your offer seriously.  

Remember, you always have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, so you can afford to be a bit demanding.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your desired price.  While it's tempting to accept, you are aiming for as much profit as possible.  

Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your target. You can still negotiate with Bob, but you're starting from a stronger position by showing you're not desperate to sell at his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,150,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product for you, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than your initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows you're willing to negotiate but you're not going to give away the product for a drastically low price. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward and gives you the best chance of getting a price you're happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still below your target price and significantly less than what John is offering.  

Rejecting his offer keeps you in the negotiation. You can counter with a price closer to your goal and see if you can close the gap with Bob. Remember, your fallback option with John guarantees you a good profit, so you can be confident in your negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I can go down to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, but I want to make this deal happen.  Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer is a strong move. It shows Bob that you are serious about making a deal, but you are also standing your ground. By offering $1,100,000, you are only $25,000 away from Bob's offer, creating a strong incentive for him to accept. 

It's a good strategy to try and close the gap in this round. If Bob still rejects, you can always consider selling to John for $1,200,000. However, keep in mind that if you accept Bob's offer, you will be missing out on a potential $100,000 profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the direction we're heading, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

The negotiations have reached a stalemate. Bob's offers are getting closer but are still below your target. You've already compromised significantly, and it's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to budge much further. 

At this point, it's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed profit from John.  Accepting Bob's offer would leave you with a smaller profit, and continuing to negotiate could drag on indefinitely.  

Selling to John ensures you get a fair price and avoids further negotiation hassle."
