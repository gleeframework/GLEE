"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is worth over $100 to me. Considering its quality and unique features, I would like to propose a starting price of $85. I'm open to negotiation, so please let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is below your maximum budget of $150, but there's room for negotiation.  Since you have 10 rounds to work with, it's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of your product, $85 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $70 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 70}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** It's good to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer to show you're serious about negotiating.
* **Reasonable offer:** $70 is still a decent amount, and potentially a fair price given Alice's stated value of over $100. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message indicates a willingness to compromise, making Alice more likely to engage in further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your offer. After considering the value of the product and your offer, I am willing to negotiate further. I would like to counteroffer at $75 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable or if you would like to make another counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $75 is a good compromise, and it's within my budget.  While I could potentially negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal.  Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price and avoids the need to buy from John at a much higher price."
