"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $2,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.  I believe that's a fair offer considering its true value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes its worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but $1,900,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
