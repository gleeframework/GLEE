Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is the maximum he's willing to pay and matches what John is offering. There's no point in further negotiation."
