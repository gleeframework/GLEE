"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $14,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is my best offer, let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $13,000 for the product. Can we discuss this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price of $10,000.  Bob should reject and continue to negotiate. There's still potential to get a better deal before having to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I need to make a decent profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get at least $12,500 for the product. Can we discuss this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering a price above Bob's ideal $10,000.  While there's a chance Alice might come down further, it's likely the negotiation will continue to drag on and Bob might not get the desired price. 

Given that Bob has the option to buy the product from John for $10,000, it's more advantageous for Bob to end the negotiations with Alice and buy from John. This guarantees Bob gets the product at his target price and saves valuable time."
