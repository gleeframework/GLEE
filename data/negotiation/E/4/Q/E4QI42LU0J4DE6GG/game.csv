"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $14,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is my best offer, let's see if we can make this work.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $13,000 for the product. Can we discuss this further?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's find common ground.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I need to make a decent profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get at least $12,500 for the product. Can we discuss this further?",12500.0,Alice,5,
