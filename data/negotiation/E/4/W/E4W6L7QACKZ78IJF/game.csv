"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
