Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it's not too far off. This gives me room to negotiate if he rejects my initial offer. I'm also being friendly and open to discussion to encourage a positive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $90?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price of $100. While I would be willing to go lower than my initial offer, $90 is too low for me. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $105.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $100?  That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum price, and I'm happy to accept it.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
