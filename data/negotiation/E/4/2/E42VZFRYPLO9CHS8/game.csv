"Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering the product. However, $1,000,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $800,000. It's a fair price given the value I see in this product.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a pattern here, and I appreciate your persistence. However, the value of this product is simply too high to let it go for $800,000.  My final offer is $900,000. Take it or leave it.",900000.0,Alice,5,
