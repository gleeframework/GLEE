"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to secure a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. I could come down to $10,500.  It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. While $10,500 is still a bit more than Bob's ideal price, it's significantly better than buying from John for $12,000.  There's a good chance Alice might not budge further, so accepting this offer is the best way to secure a decent deal."
