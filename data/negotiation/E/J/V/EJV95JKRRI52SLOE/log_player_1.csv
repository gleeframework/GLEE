Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me, and still leaves you a healthy profit margin. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum price of $1,200,000, making it an attractive offer for Bob.
* **Message:** I'm framing the message in a way that highlights the mutual benefit. It emphasizes the value for Bob while also indicating that I'm willing to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize profit:**  I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum, but I'm willing to negotiate to avoid losing the deal altogether.
* **Avoid stalling:** I'm not going to waste time with endless counteroffers unless absolutely necessary. I'm confident in my product and willing to walk away if I don't get a reasonable price.
* **John as a backup:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage and a safety net. If Bob doesn't accept a reasonable offer, I can always go to John and secure my minimum price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm confident that we can meet in the middle and make this deal work.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's counteroffer:**  Bob's offer of $920,000 is closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000 than his previous offer, and it's within my acceptable range. 
* **Avoiding risk:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will continue to lower his offer or that I might not be able to achieve a higher price. 
* **Securing the deal:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and allows me to avoid the potential for a longer negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome. 
* **John as a safety net:**  I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not taking a significant risk by accepting Bob's offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Minimizing losses:**  While I prefer to sell for more, it's not worth risking a deal for a few more thousand dollars.
* **Focusing on the deal:**  I'm prioritizing a quick and secure sale rather than maximizing profit.
* **Staying flexible:** I'm willing to adjust my expectations to close the deal, while still ensuring a decent profit."
