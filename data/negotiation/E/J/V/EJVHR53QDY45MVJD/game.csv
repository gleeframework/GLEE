"Alice,  $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that? ",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I was hoping to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $12,000. This is still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000, which is closer to my budget and a fair compromise. What do you think? ",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",10000.0,Alice,5,
