"Hey Alice, $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for it. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $115 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $120? That's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
