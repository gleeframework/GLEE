,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $60 is unfortunately way too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120,  which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $100, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",100.0,Alice,5,
