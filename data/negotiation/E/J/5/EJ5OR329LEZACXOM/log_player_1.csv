Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That price is a bit high for me though. Would you be willing to come down to $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to accept that.  I'll try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $60 is unfortunately way too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120,  which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While $90 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $100, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I could go up to $95, but that's really the most I can do.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
