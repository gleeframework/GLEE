"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I think $950,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000

Round 7

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting very close to what I can afford.  I'm willing to stretch to $800,000, but that's my absolute limit.
