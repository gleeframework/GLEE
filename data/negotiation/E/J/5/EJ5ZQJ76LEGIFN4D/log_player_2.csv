```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,875? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. Alice's offer is getting closer to his budget, but it's still higher than John's price. Since he's aiming to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
