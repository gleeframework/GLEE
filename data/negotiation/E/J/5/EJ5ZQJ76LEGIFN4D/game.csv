"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to go to $8,750. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,875? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know what you think.",8875.0,Alice,5,
