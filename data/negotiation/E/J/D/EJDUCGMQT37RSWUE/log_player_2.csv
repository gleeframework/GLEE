"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a better price than $100 from John, it's still above the product's value to you ($100). You can likely get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point for negotiation. It's a fair price considering the product's value to Alice ($80) and your maximum price ($100). It's also a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing your willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90 is still higher than the product's value to you ($80), but it's closer to your maximum price ($100) and a better deal than buying from John.  It's likely that continuing to negotiate will only result in small further reductions, and the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffers and losing time is not worth the potential for a few dollars saved."
