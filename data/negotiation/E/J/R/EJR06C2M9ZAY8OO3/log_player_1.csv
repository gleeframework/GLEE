"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. This first offer is a strong opening point, and I'm confident that I can negotiate down from here if necessary.  I also want to see how interested Bob truly is. If he rejects this, it will tell me if he values the product enough to engage in further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than what I initially offered him, which means he's likely trying to get a bargain. I'm willing to negotiate but I won't settle for his counteroffer. I'll try to meet him halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm dropping my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a good profit.  $1,350,000 is a fair compromise, and hopefully Bob will see that it's a good deal for him too."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my target price.  While I'd prefer to get more, the risk of losing him and ending up with $1,000,000 from John is not worth it. This offer is a good deal and secures me a decent profit."
