This counter-offer significantly lowers the price, aiming closer to Alice's value of $120 while staying well below my $150 limit.  Starting low leaves room for negotiation and increases the chance of getting a better deal."

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but there's still room for negotiation before considering John's offer."

We're now negotiating within a narrow range.  This counter-offer keeps the pressure on while still being a price I'd accept."
