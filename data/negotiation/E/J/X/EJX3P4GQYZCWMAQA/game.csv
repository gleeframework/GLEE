"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I do see the value in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you see the value in the product, Bob, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm still a ways off from that number. How about we split the difference between our last offers and land at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but that's still a bit rich for me. To be honest, I have another offer on the table, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can make the numbers work. Would you be willing to settle at $1,000,000 even?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm intrigued that you have another offer on the table, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell at $1,000,000, as it's below my minimum target. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1,150,000, or I'll have to consider other options?",1150000.0,Alice,7,
