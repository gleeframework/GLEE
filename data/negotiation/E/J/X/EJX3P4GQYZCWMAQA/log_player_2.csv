Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you see the value in the product, Bob, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1,100,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1,150,000?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm intrigued that you have another offer on the table, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell at $1,000,000, as it's below my minimum target. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1,150,000, or I'll have to consider other options?

It's clear Alice is not budging from this price point.  It's unlikely we'll get a better deal than John's offer at this point, and it's not worth risking the time remaining."
