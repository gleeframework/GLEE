Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's the price I was thinking of originally, and I think it's a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is now matching the price John is offering. There's no guarantee of getting a better price from Alice in further rounds, and it's best to secure the deal now."
