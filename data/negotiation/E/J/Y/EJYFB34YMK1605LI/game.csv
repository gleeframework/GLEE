"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to you and gives us both a good outcome. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're both trying to find common ground here. While I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is still a bit too low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000? This would be a fair compromise and allow us to close the deal. What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",925000.0,Bob,6,
