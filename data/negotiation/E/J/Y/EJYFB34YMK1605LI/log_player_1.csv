"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's below my minimum value of $1,200,000 but leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows I'm willing to be flexible while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum value. I need to hold firm and try to negotiate a better price.  I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to you and gives us both a good outcome. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to come closer to my desired price while still being within his budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I need to try and push for a higher price, but I'm also aware that time is ticking, so I need to be careful about rejecting too many offers. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see that we're both trying to find common ground here. While I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is still a bit too low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000? This would be a fair compromise and allow us to close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm offering a compromise at $975,000. This is still below my minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept and finalize the deal before I run out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds remaining, and Bob's offers consistently below my minimum, it's becoming risky to continue negotiating.  I'm losing valuable time, and I don't want to risk ending up with a lower price than what John is offering. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, and I'm confident that I'll be able to find a better buyer later on."
