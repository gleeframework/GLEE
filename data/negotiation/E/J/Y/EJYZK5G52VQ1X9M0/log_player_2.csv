# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've been working on for a long time and I know it has the potential to be very profitable. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up at $800,000, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
