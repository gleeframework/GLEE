"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While the product sounds interesting, I'm not sure it's worth $9500 to me. I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value and rarity.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and I pay you $8500?  I'm very interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $8750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value and rarity.",8750.0,Alice,5,
