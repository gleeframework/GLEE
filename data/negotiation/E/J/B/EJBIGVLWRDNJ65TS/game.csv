"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's see if we can make this work.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 was still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we try $102? It's a good compromise that still gives me a decent profit, and I think you'll find it more reasonable.",102.0,Alice,5,
