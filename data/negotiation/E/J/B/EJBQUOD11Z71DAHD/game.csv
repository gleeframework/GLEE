"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value I'm willing to compromise on.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle at $925,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $925,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $975,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you.",975000.0,Alice,5,
