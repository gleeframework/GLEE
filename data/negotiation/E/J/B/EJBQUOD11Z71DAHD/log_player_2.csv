"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value I'm willing to compromise on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle at $925,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 925000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $925,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $975,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than her current offer of $975,000. Since you can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, it makes more financial sense to take John's offer and save the extra $25,000."
