Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $91 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference again and settle on $89? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 89}

You're getting very close to your target price. It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate a lower price one more time.  Remember, John is offering the product for $100, so anything less than that is a good deal."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm not willing to give in just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $90, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.
