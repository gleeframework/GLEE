Round 2
Bob's offer:

Bob is still leaving a lot of potential profit on the table. We're making progress, but it's worth pushing for more in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $975,000 is a little too far off from what I had in mind. How about we settle at $1,000,000? This would be my final offer."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a compromise. How about $990,000? Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000

While we're still leaving some profit on the table, getting $990,000 is a strong outcome. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk Bob walking away in later rounds."
