"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I think a starting price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way too high for me.  I'm thinking closer to $6,000 would be more reasonable. What do you say?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your feedback. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would represent a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Could you consider something closer to $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, my absolute bottom line, to make this work. This is a final offer, as I already have another interested buyer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
