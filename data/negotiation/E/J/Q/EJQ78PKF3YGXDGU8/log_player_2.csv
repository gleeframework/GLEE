Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000. What do you think about that?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's more favorable to me.  This will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see how much room there is for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $800000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $850000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, which is a good sign. However, I'm still not ready to commit. I want to see if I can push for a price closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit hesitant at $850,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $825,000?  This feels like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to push for a lower price, but I'm now offering a compromise to show good faith.  Splitting the difference between my previous offer and Alice's last offer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a price closer to my goal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $825000. I'll meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $825000 + $12500, which is $837500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $837,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $837,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a lower price, Alice has been consistent in her counteroffers, and we're now within a reasonable range.  Accepting this offer means saving a significant amount compared to buying from John.  The risk of further negotiation could lead to a deadlock or a worse outcome, and there are only five rounds remaining."
