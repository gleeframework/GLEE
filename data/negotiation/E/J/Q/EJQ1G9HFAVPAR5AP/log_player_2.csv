"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on a one-of-a-kind item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is still too high for him, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating further or by buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $9,000 for this product. It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?
