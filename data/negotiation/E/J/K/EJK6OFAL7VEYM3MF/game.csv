"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value to you is much higher than $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to lower the price to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'd be comfortable with $725,000 for the product. This offer represents a significant investment from my side while acknowledging the product's value.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product, but $725,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm willing to lower the price to $825,000. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us, considering the product's worth to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position and I'm willing to budge a little more. How about $775,000? This price shows my commitment to acquiring the product while recognizing its value to both of us.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $775,000, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to lower the price to $825,000 was too high, but I'll meet you at $795,000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",795000.0,Alice,7,
