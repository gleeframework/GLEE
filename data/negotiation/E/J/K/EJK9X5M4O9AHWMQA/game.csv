,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80, which is the maximum I'm comfortable with. Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your honest offer, Bob. I understand that $80 is your maximum budget. I can do a bit better than that. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little more than I can do.  How about we split the difference at $95?  This feels like a fair compromise to me.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $95. I can do $105, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still trying to find a way to make this work within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $90. This is a significant move for me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you say?",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price, Bob. However, I'm not ready to accept $90 just yet. I can meet you halfway between $90 and $105, which is $97.50. Is that something you'd be interested in?",97.5,Alice,7,
