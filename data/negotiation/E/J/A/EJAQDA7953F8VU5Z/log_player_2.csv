Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is more than his maximum budget of $8,000.  He should counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, but that's my absolute maximum."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can meet you in the middle at $11000. Would you be willing to consider that price?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her previous offer, it's still above his budget. He should try to negotiate further, but if Alice won't budge, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down. $11,000 is still outside my price range, but I'm willing to go up to $9,500. It's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9500. I'm willing to go up to $10500, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy from John.  Alice is now willing to sell for $10,500, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Since John is selling for $8,000, it's the best deal available to Bob."
