"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, but that's my absolute maximum.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can meet you in the middle at $11000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down. $11000 is still outside my price range, but I'm willing to go up to $9500. It's my final offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9500. I'm willing to go up to $10500, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10500.0,Alice,5,
