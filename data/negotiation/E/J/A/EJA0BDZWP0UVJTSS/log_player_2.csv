"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000.  I know it's valuable to you, and this is a very competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  While $14,000 is more than Alice's value ($8,000), it's still $1,000 cheaper than buying from John. 
* **You have room to negotiate:**  You could potentially get Alice to lower the price further, but it's not clear if that's possible.  Since you're already getting a better deal than John, accepting is the logical choice."
