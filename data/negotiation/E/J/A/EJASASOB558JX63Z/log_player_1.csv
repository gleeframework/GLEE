"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a strong offer that's closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) than my minimum ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""incredible potential and value,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, justifying the high price.
* **Leaving John as Backup:** I'm keeping the option of selling to John ($800,000) in my back pocket if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer is significantly lower than my target. While it's above my absolute minimum, I believe I have room to negotiate a better price.
* It's still early in the negotiation (Round 2). I'm willing to counter and see if I can get closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the unique advantages this product offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000, which reflects its true worth and potential for your specific needs."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** I'm making a significant concession by dropping $75,000, but not meeting Bob exactly in the middle. This shows flexibility while still aiming high.
* **Re-emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's unique value proposition and tailoring it to ""your specific needs"" to remind Bob why he was initially willing to pay $1,200,000.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By stating this price ""reflects its true worth,"" I'm subtly pushing back against the idea of it being valued much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  $975,000 is a significant profit above my minimum ($800,000). 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob is consistently pushing for the midpoint. Accepting this offer shows I'm willing to compromise and avoids the risk of him walking away.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out the negotiation further might not yield significantly better results, and I risk losing Bob altogether."
