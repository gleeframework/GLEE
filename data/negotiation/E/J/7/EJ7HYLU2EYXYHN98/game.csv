"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $550,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",550000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While $550,000 is appealing, it's a significant drop from my initial asking price.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This reflects the true value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $700,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
