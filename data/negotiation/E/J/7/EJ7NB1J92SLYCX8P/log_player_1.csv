Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness:** I'm framing it as a fair price to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to share his thoughts, indicating flexibility.
* **Plan B:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me a safety net and a benchmark for when to stop negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $14,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below the $15,000 I can get from John.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** By rejecting, I can counter-offer and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Avoiding immediate loss:** Selling now for $13,000 would be a loss compared to selling to John.

I'll counter-offer Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? I'm confident this product will be worth it for you."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with a compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, showing willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Reiterate the value:** Highlighting the product's value again reminds Bob of its potential worth.
* **Maintaining the negotiation:** This counter-offer keeps the negotiation open, giving me the opportunity to reach a more favorable price before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,500.  Let's split the difference and go with $13,250.  It's a fair price for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting closer to my minimum:** While $13,250 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my comfort zone and not a significant improvement.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Further negotiation with Bob risks prolonging the process and might not lead to a much better price.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of missing out on the guaranteed $15,000 from John.

Therefore, I'm choosing to sell to John for a guaranteed profit that's much closer to my desired value."
