Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $180. This gives him a potential profit of $30, which is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
While I would ideally prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $160 is still a reasonable profit for me and is higher than what I would get from selling to John.  It's better to secure the sale than to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price or no sale at all."
