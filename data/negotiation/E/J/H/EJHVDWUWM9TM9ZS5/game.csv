"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. I'm willing to compromise a bit, how about $1,050,000?  It's still a great value for you, considering the product's worth. Let's find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with, but I still think $950,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle, how about $975,000? I think that's a fair price for the product.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $1,025,000.  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.  What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $975,000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you meet me at that price?",975000.0,Bob,6,
