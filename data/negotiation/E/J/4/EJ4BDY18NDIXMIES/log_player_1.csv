"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, it's still below my minimum price point. I have 8 rounds left and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,250,000? This gives us both a fair deal, and we can close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $1,150,000? That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While we're getting closer, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I have 6 rounds left, and I think I can get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $1,150,000 just isn't feasible for me.  Let's split the difference: $1,200,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, and we can finally close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
