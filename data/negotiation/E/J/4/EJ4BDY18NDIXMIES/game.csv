"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,250,000? This gives us both a fair deal, and we can close this quickly.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $1,150,000? That's a fair compromise, I think.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $1,150,000 just isn't feasible for me.  Let's split the difference: $1,200,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, and we can finally close this transaction.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
