"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While Alice's offer is higher than her value of the product, it's still significantly lower than the $1,500,000 you would pay John.
