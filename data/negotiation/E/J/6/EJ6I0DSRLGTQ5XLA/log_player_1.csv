Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know would be highly valuable to you, for $11,500. "", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **Secure a Deal:**  While John offers a safety net, selling to Bob at a higher price is ideal."
