"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $105. It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with it.",105.0,Alice,5,
