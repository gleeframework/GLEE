Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, I can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value to justify the higher price without revealing my absolute bottom line. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $15,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum."
