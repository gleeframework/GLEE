"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $140. I believe it offers a lot of value and you'll be very happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Buying from Alice is cheaper:** Alice's offer of $140 is lower than John's price of $150.
* **The product is worth it to Bob:**  The product is worth $150 to Bob, so even at $140, he's getting a good deal."
