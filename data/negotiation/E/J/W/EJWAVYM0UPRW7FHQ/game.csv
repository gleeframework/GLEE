I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $1200000 to reflect its value to you.,1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $1200000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $850000 for it, reflecting the maximum I can afford while still finding it a worthwhile investment.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I believe the product's value to you is higher than $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's worth to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $900000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll offer it to you for $925000. I think this is a fair price that balances your budget with the product's value to you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
