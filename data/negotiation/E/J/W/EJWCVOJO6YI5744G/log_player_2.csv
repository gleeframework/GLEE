"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Buying from Alice saves you money:**  Alice's offer of $120 is less than what you'd pay John ($150).
* **You're still within your budget:** The $120 price is within your maximum budget of $150."
