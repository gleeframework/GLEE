"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than her perceived value of the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,000 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

We start by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's opening offer, but still leaving room for further negotiation.  This gives us the best chance of achieving a price closer to Alice's perceived value of $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I can meet you in the middle at $8,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to her perceived value, but there's still a potential for saving more. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about $8,000? That feels like a fair price to me."",

}
``` 

We're now aiming directly for Alice's perceived value. This offer has a good chance of being accepted, as it represents a reasonable profit for Alice while still saving us money."
