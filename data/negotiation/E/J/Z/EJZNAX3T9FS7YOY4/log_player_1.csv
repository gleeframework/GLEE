Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know is of great value to your business. My asking price is $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the significant benefits this product offers. I'm open to discussing your thoughts and any potential counteroffers you might have."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Considering the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $950,000 is higher than John's offer, it's still far below what I consider a fair price for this product. I'll try to negotiate a better deal with Bob before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is not quite where I need to be, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer still provides you with a significant return on your investment and allows me to achieve a fair price for this valuable product. Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still above my target. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This is a significant amount and represents a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize this and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still confident I can achieve a higher price with continued negotiation.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before resorting to John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue working towards a mutually agreeable price. While $1,000,000 is closer to where I need to be, I'm proposing $1,050,000 as a final counteroffer.

I'm confident this price is fair and represents a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
