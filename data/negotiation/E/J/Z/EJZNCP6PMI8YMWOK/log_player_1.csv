I'm starting with my highest possible price, hoping to get lucky and have Bob accept. This maximizes my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering Bob $11,000. This is a compromise between my minimum price and his offer. I hope he'll find it reasonable enough to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offers are getting too low. I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $12,000. It's better to sell to John and secure my minimum profit."
