"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. However, I must respectfully decline the counteroffer of $11,000.

"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I am unable to accept the offer of $11,500. However, I would like to propose a revised price of $12,500 for the product. This is the highest price I can offer while still ensuring a fair return for my company.",12500.0,Alice,5,
