Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

We're getting closer, but I'm still holding out for a better offer from Bob.  We're still well above John's offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

It's time to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Strong Return:** $1,325,000 is a significant profit above my minimum ($1,000,000) and a good return on the negotiation.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  We're now negotiating in small increments. It's unlikely further back and forth will yield a much better outcome.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing carries the risk of Bob walking away or the deal becoming unnecessarily protracted. 

Closing the deal now secures a very good price."
