"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good price, there's always the potential to negotiate further and get an even better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to secure a substantial discount.  A $100,000 drop from Alice's initial price is a bold move, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate and potentially pushing Alice towards a lower price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer.  While Bob could continue negotiating, $825,000 is a good price, significantly lower than John's $1,000,000 offer. It's a good balance between getting a good deal and avoiding the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or the potential for the negotiation to become time-consuming."
