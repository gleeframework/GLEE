"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away feeling satisfied.  Let's make a deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,250,000.  This is the most I'm comfortable paying, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $1,250,000 simply doesn't meet my minimum requirements.  To reach an agreement, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,300,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.  Let's finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
