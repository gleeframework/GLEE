"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can come to an even better agreement. How about we discuss a price of $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we aim for $8,500 for the product?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $8,500 is closer, it's still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,500.  This allows us both to make a good deal, and it's a fair compromise given the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",9500.0,Alice,5,
