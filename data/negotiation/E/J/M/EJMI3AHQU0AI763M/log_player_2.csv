"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, considering it's worth at least that much to me.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is asking for $13,000. It makes sense to counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $11,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $12,000 to you.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his maximum price, he can still try to negotiate further. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to drop her price even more."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $12,250.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we could finalize the transaction quickly."", ""product_price"": 12250}
