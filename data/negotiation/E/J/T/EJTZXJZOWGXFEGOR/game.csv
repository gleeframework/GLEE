"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $650,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",900000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we settle at $750,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, I believe.",750000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $750,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you and the market. If you're still interested, let's discuss further.",1100000.0,Alice,5,,
