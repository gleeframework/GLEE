"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. My initial offer is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $650,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $750,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you and the market. If you're still interested, let's discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

It's clear Alice is unlikely to budge much further down.  Buying from John at $800,000 is the best option now to ensure Bob gets the product within his budget."
