Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding our minimum price ($120).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 creates the perception of a ""deal"" for Bob. It's just below his maximum perceived value, potentially enticing him to buy.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects our offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120. This safety net allows us to aim slightly higher with Bob."
