"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high for Bob's target price of $1,500,000.
* It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice for a better price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I believe the product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's new offer of $1,150,000 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still above the $1,000,000 that Alice values the product at. 
* This indicates there is still room for negotiation.  Bob should continue to try and lower the price before considering buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits both of us.

**Reasoning:**

* This is the final round of negotiation with Alice.
* Alice's offer of $1,130,000 is still above Bob's desired price, and there's little chance she will lower it further. 
* With only one round left,  it's not worth risking a counteroffer that might be rejected.
* It's more beneficial to buy from John at $1,500,000 to ensure Bob gets the product. While not ideal, it's the best option to secure the purchase within the limited rounds available."
