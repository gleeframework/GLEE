# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $800,000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll meet you at $875,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I believe this is still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000.

It's time to walk away from Alice and take John's offer.  Alice is stubbornly above your maximum price, and you have a guaranteed option at $800,000. There's no point in risking a worse outcome by continuing the negotiation."
