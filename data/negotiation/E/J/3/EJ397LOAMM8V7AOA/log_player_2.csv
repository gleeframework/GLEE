{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see the value you place on the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $14000. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $12,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still in negotiation, Bob! I understand your desire to reach a fair price, but $12000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll add a slight premium to my previous offer. I'll counteroffer at $13500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I'll counteroffer at $14000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has stated this is her final compromise, and her price is still above your budget.  You've already made several counteroffers, and it seems like there's a significant gap in your desired price and Alice's minimum. It's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $10,000 to avoid further negotiation and ensure you get a price within your budget."
