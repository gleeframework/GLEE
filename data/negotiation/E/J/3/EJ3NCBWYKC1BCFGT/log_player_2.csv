"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Reasoning: While $110 is better than $120, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $110 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now. Would you consider $105? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $107.50. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning: At $107.50, Alice's offer is within Bob's budget ($120) and also a good deal compared to John's price.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice could reject the counteroffer and the price could go back up, potentially leading to buying from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer is the safest and most cost-effective option."
