Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $80 but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to negotiate a price that is fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}

I'm offering a price of $105. This is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely.  I'm confident I can make up for the lower price on another deal."
