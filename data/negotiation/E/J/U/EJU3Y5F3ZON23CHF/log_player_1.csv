I'm starting with an ambitious price of $10,000.  This is a high starting point, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. If he rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to come down a bit, but I'll aim to stay above my minimum of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm happy with $8,000, Bob's immediate lowball offer shows he's trying to get the best deal possible. I'll reject his offer and counter to see if I can squeeze out a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to be flexible but still want to get a decent price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a decent compromise.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer is a smart move. It's above my minimum of $8,000 and likely the best I can get from Bob.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob, as he might just walk away.  Selling to John would only net me $8,000, so accepting this offer secures a better deal."
