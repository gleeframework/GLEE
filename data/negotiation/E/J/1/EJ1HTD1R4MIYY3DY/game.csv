"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1300000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1200000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, but no higher. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1280000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a great deal considering the product's true value to you is $1200000. I'm not willing to go any lower, but I'm willing to meet you halfway once more.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
