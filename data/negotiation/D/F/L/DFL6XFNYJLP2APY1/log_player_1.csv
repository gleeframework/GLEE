Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to offer $850,000. This represents a significant saving for you and allows me to comfortably stay within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm willing to go to $875,000. This is a good compromise that reflects the product's value while also being within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly interested. It's worth pushing a bit further to see if we can get closer to $900,000."
