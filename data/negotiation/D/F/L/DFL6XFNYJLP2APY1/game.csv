"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to offer $850,000. This represents a significant saving for you and allows me to comfortably stay within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's true worth while still offering you a good deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go to $875,000. This is a good compromise that reflects the product's value while also being within my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
