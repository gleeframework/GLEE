**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than Alice's value for the product ($1,200,000 vs. $1,000,000).**  This means Alice is making a profit and there's potential to negotiate a better price.
* **John's price is your upper limit ($1,500,000).**  You're willing to pay this much, but it's your maximum. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation open.** This allows you to try and get a better deal from Alice or potentially find another seller offering a lower price than John."
