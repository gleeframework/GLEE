"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to justify the high initial price. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  I clearly signal that this is just a starting point and I'm willing to discuss different options, making Bob more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your enthusiasm. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to counteroffer at $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount. Rejecting this offer signals that I'm serious about the product's value and opens the door for further counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations. However, the price you proposed doesn't reflect the true value of this product and its potential return on investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and counter at $1,650,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial price. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message reinforces the product's value and potential ROI, subtly justifying the higher price.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By calling it a ""significant compromise,"" I'm implying this is a strong offer and encouraging Bob to consider it seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I've carefully considered the value of the product and your offer. I would like to counteroffer at $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000 (considering I might incur some opportunity cost by not selling to John immediately). While I could push for a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob walking away increases.  Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
