Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a starting point.  I'm aiming high, at $1,500,000, as I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. This leaves room for negotiation while still being profitable. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  $1,350,000 is a fair compromise, showing I'm willing to work with him while still protecting my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm going to make one final counteroffer.  If he rejects it, I'm willing to sell to John and cut my losses."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

This is my final offer. It's a significant compromise from my initial offer, but I'm still holding out for a price that reflects the product's value. If Bob rejects this, I'll be selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get a little closer to my initial goal, it seems like Bob is not willing to budge further. To ensure a sale and not risk losing out completely, I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000."
