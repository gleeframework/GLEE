"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's fair to both of us. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
