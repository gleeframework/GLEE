"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a great price of $11,000. I think it would be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It shows Bob is serious about purchasing the product but is also trying to get a good deal.  $9,500 is a fair price that is still higher than Alice's minimum value for the product, making it likely Alice will consider it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $11,000 represents a fair price for its value, I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This feels like a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,250 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's offer of $12,000 and still above Alice's minimum value of $8,000.  There's a good chance Alice won't go lower, and Bob is better off securing the product at a reasonable price than risking further negotiation."
