"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. Would you like to buy it from me for $120?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we settle on $110? I'm confident you'll love the product and it's worth every penny.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $95.  Let's find a way to make this work.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down a bit further, so how about we meet at $105? It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll be happy with it.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference at $100.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a fair price, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $100. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, so how about we try $108? It's a great price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll be happy with it.",108.0,Alice,7,
