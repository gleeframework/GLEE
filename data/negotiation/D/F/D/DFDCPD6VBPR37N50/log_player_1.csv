"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price closer to my minimum of $15,000.  I'm also mindful of John's offer, so I'm not going to start too ridiculously high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. I want to see if I can push him a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm going to counter with $15,500. This is still above my minimum, but it's a significant drop from my initial offer, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. It also gives me room to come down a bit more in future rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for more.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000 unless I absolutely have to.  John's offer is still a safety net if this negotiation falls apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to stick with my minimum.  It's a risk, but I've made it clear I'm not willing to go lower, and Bob seems motivated to buy. If he rejects this, I'll still have the option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still too low, and we're running out of rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing."
