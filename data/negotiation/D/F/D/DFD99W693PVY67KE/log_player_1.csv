"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value, and leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $75. While it's tempting to close the deal, it's below my minimum value of $80. I'm going to proceed to the next round and see if I can get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $90. This is still above my minimum value, and hopefully, a more appealing price for Bob.  I believe this price might be a good compromise, and could lead to a successful deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $80.  This is my minimum value, and I'm happy to close the deal. There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
