{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  You can likely get a better price than $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $75. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, and it shows I'm serious about getting a good deal.  We'll see if she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is closer to my maximum, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll reject and try to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

I'm going to offer $80. This is a reasonable compromise, and it shows Alice that I'm willing to meet her halfway."
