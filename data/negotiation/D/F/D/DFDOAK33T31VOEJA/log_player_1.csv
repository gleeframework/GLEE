Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and this is a competitive offer considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's potential to sell it for a price higher than your minimum ($8,000).
* **Negotiating Room:**  Starting with a strong offer ($9,500) leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so you can afford to aim higher with Bob.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's walk-away price (the maximum he's willing to pay). If you had more information about Bob's budget or negotiation style, you could adjust your offer accordingly."
