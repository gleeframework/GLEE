"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:

I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to you. What do you think?

At this point, Alice has come down slightly, but her offer of $825,000 is still higher than John's offer of $800,000.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to yield a price better than John's."
