I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is a decent price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price range.  I want to see if I can negotiate further with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $900,000 is a bit lower than where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a slightly higher amount. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I think I can get a better price with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is getting closer to what I need, but I'm still a bit away from my target.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering you the product for $975,000.  This leaves us both with a fair deal and a successful outcome.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
