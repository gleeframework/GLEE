"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $750,000 is too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $850,000. This is still a significant saving for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $850,000. Can you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
