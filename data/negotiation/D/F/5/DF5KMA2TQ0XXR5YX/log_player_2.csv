"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for a price of $11,000. I believe this product will be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further. You can still save money compared to buying from John, and you know the product is worth less to Alice than your maximum price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the product is worth significantly more to you than that. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250.

While Alice's offer is closer to your ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. You can try to get closer to your target price of $9,500 by counteroffering again."
