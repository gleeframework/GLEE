Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's incredibly valuable, and I believe it could benefit you greatly. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you at $950,000. I'm confident this price reflects the immense value it holds."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as much money as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), I need to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $950,000 creates a strong incentive for Bob.  It's a significant discount from my reserve price and a substantial profit for me if he accepts. 
* **Confident Language:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as a fair deal, increasing the chances of Bob accepting. 
 
**Important Note:** This is a starting point. I might adjust my offer based on Bob's initial reaction or any additional information I gather during the negotiation."
