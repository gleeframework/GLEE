"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it's even more valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it for $900,000. This price reflects the value it will bring to your business. Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value to my business. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm still confident in the product's value and I'm willing to come down a bit further. Let's try $850,000. This is a fair price considering the significant benefits it will bring to your business. I'm open to discussing further but I can't go any lower than this.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it's a price that works for me.",800000.0,Bob,4,
