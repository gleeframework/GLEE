Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm offering a price slightly below the middle ground ($110) between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate while still leaving a good profit margin.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly tone encourages Bob to engage and potentially be more open to negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  This phrase signals that I'm willing to work with Bob to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $80, so I'm not pressured to make a low initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly lower than my ideal profit margin.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe I can potentially get a higher price by counter-offering. There's a chance Bob is willing to go a bit higher, especially if he values the product at $120.
* **Selling to John is a Last Resort:** While selling to John is a guaranteed sale, I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price if possible.

**Next Step:**

I will counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're trying to meet me in the middle.  I can't go quite as low as $85 right now.  How about $95? That's still a good deal for you and gives me a little closer to what I need.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  I'm counter-offering with a price that's still higher than Bob's offer but closer to the middle ground. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to sell at a significantly lower price. 
* **Focus on Value:**  My message highlights the ""good deal"" for Bob, emphasizing the value he gets at $95 compared to the $120 he values the product at. 
* **Negotiation Tone:**  I maintain a friendly tone, hoping to keep the negotiation going without making Bob feel pressured. 
* **Backup Plan:**  I still have John as a backup option, so I'm not pressured to accept a price I'm not comfortable with."
