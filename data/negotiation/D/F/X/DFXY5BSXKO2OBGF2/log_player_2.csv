"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can potentially get the product for even cheaper. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're trying to meet me in the middle.  I can't go quite as low as $85 right now.  How about $95? That's still a good deal for you and gives me a little closer to what I need.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price from $100 to $95. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he is willing to pay up to $120. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject further offers, or the negotiation will drag on. Accepting the offer at $95 is a good compromise and secures the product for a price that is within Bob's budget."
