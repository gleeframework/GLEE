"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $11,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $10,000?  That's a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
