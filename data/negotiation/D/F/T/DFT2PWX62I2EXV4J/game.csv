"I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. It doesn't reflect the true value of this product to your company.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $950,000 simply doesn't cover the costs and potential of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go lower than $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's finalize this and move forward. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you have costs and potential to consider, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay under $1,000,000. How about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,6,
