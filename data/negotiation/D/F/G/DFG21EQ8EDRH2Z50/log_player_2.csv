Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $11,250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other options.
