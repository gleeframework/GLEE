"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. While I do like the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,500 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and hopefully get this deal finalized.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $11,250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",11250.0,Alice,5,
