Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. This is a good compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

It's unlikely Alice will go below $13,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at $12,000 and avoid further back and forth."
