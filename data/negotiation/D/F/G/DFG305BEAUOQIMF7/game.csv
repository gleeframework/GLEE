"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. This is a good compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $14,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000?  I think that's a fair price.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
