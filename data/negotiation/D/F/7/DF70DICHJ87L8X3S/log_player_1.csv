Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $14,000 is more than your minimum of $12,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** The offer is below Bob's perceived value of $15,000, so he has incentive to negotiate. 
* **It shows you're serious:**  By making a concrete offer, you demonstrate your willingness to engage in a negotiation. 

Remember, you can always adjust the price based on Bob's response. If he rejects, you can lower the price slightly or make a counteroffer.  However, keep in mind that you always have the option of selling to John for $12,000 if the negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Counteroffer:** I can present a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting, I show Bob that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to walk away.

This will hopefully push Bob closer to my desired price or at least allow us to find a compromise. If negotiations stall, I can always sell to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

This counteroffer is a good choice because:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than your initial offer:** This shows you're willing to compromise while still maintaining a profitable margin.
* **It provides a clear justification:** By mentioning the product's value, you're subtly reminding Bob of its worth, potentially encouraging him to meet you halfway.
* **It keeps the negotiation open:** This counteroffer keeps the door open for further discussion and potentially a mutually beneficial agreement.

Remember, you always have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Meeting your minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 matches your minimum acceptable price.  This means you're guaranteed to earn a profit.
* **No further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that further negotiations will lead to a higher price. Bob might dig in his heels, or you could end up in a stalemate. 
* **Time is valuable:** Continuing the negotiation takes time and energy. Accepting Bob's offer allows you to move on to other opportunities.

While you might be able to squeeze out a slightly higher price, the risk of a prolonged negotiation or a breakdown in the deal outweighs the potential reward.  Accepting Bob's offer is the most practical and financially sound decision."
