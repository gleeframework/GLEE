"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $15000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to recoup at least some of the value I've invested in this product. How about $17500? This price is still a significant discount from my initial offer and I believe it's fair considering the product's potential.",17500.0,Alice,3,
