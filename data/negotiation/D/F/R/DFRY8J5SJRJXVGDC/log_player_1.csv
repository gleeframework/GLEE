Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach a deal.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
