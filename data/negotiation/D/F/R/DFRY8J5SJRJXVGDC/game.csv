"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it will be equally valuable to you. My asking price is $1,750,000. I'm open to negotiation, so let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,400,000 is a good starting point, it doesn't quite meet my needs. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, while allowing for a fair profit margin for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value I see in the product and the fact that I'm prepared to buy it right now, I'm offering a final price of $1,550,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
