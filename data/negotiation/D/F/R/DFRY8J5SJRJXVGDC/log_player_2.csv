Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, while allowing for a fair profit margin for both of us. Let me know what you think.

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price, as the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.  A counteroffer at a price closer to $1,500,000 will give Bob a better chance of getting a good deal."
