"Alice, $950,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good price for you considering your value for the product. Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $875,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
