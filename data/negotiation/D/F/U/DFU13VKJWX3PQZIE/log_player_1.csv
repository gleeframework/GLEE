Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $200,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit but leave Bob with a perceived gain.  Offering a price slightly below his maximum perceived value encourages him to accept.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The language is positive and positions the offer as mutually beneficial. 
* **Price:** $1,150,000  This leaves Bob with a potential perceived profit of $50,000, making your offer very appealing. 

**Important Note:** This is just one potential offer. Depending on your negotiation style and Bob's personality, you could adjust the price and message slightly."
