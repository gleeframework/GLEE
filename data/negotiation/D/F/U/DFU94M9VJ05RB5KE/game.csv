"Alice, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $11,000.  Let me know if you're open to that.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I value your offer, $11,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about $11,500? That's a good compromise and allows us both to get a fair deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
