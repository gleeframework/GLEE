"Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $12,500 for it. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,500 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I think it's fair considering the product's value. Let me know what you think!",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I am too.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $13,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're willing to go there.",13000.0,Bob,4,
