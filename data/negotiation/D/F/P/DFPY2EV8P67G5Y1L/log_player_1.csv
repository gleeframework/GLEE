Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $12,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round.  $12,500 is still too low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,500 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I think it's fair considering the product's value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I am too.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $13,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're willing to go there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
 
$13,000 is close to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and then having to settle for the lower price with John. Let's close this deal!"
