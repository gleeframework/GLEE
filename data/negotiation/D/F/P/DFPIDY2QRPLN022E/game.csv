"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product. It's a game-changer in its industry and has a lot of potential. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $12500 for the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $11500, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package and a personalized onboarding session, which normally costs $1000. With this package, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500.
