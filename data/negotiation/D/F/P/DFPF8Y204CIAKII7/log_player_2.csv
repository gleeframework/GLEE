Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm happy to make a counteroffer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is within my budget and represents a good compromise.  I'm able to save $1,500 compared to buying from John, making it a worthwhile purchase."
