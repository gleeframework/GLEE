"Alice, thanks for the offer! It's a great starting point. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? I'm genuinely interested in the product, and I think we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm happy to make a counteroffer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
