Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm asking for $130. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $80 to John if necessary.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product between $80 and $150 allows for potential profit.
* **Starting High:**  Starting with a higher price like $130 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It also aims to capture the maximum amount of value Bob perceives the product to have. 

This strategy balances securing a good profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
