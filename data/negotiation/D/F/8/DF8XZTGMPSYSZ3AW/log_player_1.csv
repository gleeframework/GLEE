Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $140. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product at $140, you are:

1. **Maximizing Profit:**  You're aiming for the highest price Bob is likely to accept, netting you a $40 profit over your minimum. 
2. **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely, Bob might counter-offer, giving you a chance to still get a better price than John's offer. 
3. **Avoiding a Lost Sale:** Setting the price too high risks Bob rejecting the offer, forcing you to sell to John for less."
