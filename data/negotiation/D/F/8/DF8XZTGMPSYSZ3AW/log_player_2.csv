# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $140. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice at $140 is cheaper than buying from John at $150.
* Even though the product is worth $100 to Alice, the deal is still beneficial for you as you are willing to pay up to $150."
