The product is too expensive at Alice's offer.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before going to John."

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer of $1,000,000. This is a big drop from Alice's price, but it's still within my budget. I'm hoping to get a good deal here, and this counteroffer gives us a starting point for negotiation."

Alice has come down some, but I'm still not happy with the price.  I'm going to try to negotiate a little lower before going to John."

I'm offering $1,150,000. It's still a good deal for me, and hopefully, Alice is willing to meet me halfway."

Alice is getting closer, but at $1,250,000, it's only $50,000 less than what John is offering.  Given the back and forth, I'm not confident I can get Alice down to $1,200,000, so I'm going to go with John."
