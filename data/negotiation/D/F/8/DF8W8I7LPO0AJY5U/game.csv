"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, my budget for this purchase is closer to $700,000.  Would you be willing to come down significantly on the price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within a budget of $700,000, but I'm afraid that's still a bit below my minimum. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. To be honest, $800,000 is the highest I'm willing to go.  There are other options available to me at that price point, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you've reached your maximum budget of $800,000, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can understand the value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
