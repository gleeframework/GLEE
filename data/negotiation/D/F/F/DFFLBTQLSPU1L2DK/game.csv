"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's make a deal!",130.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed with this product.  Let's close the deal!",125.0,Alice,5,
