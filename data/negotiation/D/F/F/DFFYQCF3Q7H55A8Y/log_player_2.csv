"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Explanation: Alice's offer is too high. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a price closer to your $120 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Strategy:** We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This tactic aims to:
    * **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** A large counteroffer will reveal how willing Alice is to negotiate. 
    * **Leave room for compromise:**  Even if Alice rejects this initial offer, there's space to gradually increase the bid and still stay below the $120 maximum.
* **Message:** The tone is polite and expresses continued interest while clearly stating the price is the main obstacle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $125, which is only slightly above your $120 limit.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether. It's best to accept this offer to secure the product at a reasonable price."
