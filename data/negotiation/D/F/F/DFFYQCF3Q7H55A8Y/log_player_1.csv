Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $140 is higher than Bob's valuation of $120, giving him some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $140 is still above your minimum of $150, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This price allows for potential back-and-forth without forcing you to immediately sell to John at your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's significantly below my minimum of $150. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
