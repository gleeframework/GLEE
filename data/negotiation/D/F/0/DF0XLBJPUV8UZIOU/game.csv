"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can make a deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  While $10,500 is a good starting point, I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make a deal.  Let's find common ground.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,250.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11250.0,Alice,5,
