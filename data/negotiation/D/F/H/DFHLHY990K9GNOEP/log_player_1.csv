"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth a lot more to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000** is a starting point that is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to me, making it seem like a good deal for Bob. 
* This initial offer sets the stage for a negotiation where I can potentially get closer to my desired price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the deal, but $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a backup buyer in John who's willing to pay my desired price. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,250** is a counter-offer that is halfway between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500. 
* The message is still friendly and attempts to find a compromise. 
* By focusing on a ""fair price"" for both of us, I aim to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage him to meet me halfway. 
* This strategy aims to find a mutually agreeable price without jeopardizing my minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position. While I appreciate the compromise,  $9,250 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

```

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $9,500 is getting closer, I'm still stuck at my budget limit.  How about $9,200?

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,200 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a happy middle ground. How about $9,350?  It's just a little bit more, but I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 9350}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,350** is a compromise between my previous offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $9,200. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate further while staying within my desired price range. 
* The message acknowledges Bob's budget constraints while emphasizing that a slight increase is necessary for me to accept the deal. 
* By framing it as a ""happy middle ground"" and a ""fair compromise,"" I aim to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer. 

With this approach, I'm seeking to close the gap and potentially secure a deal closer to my desired price without pushing Bob away completely."
