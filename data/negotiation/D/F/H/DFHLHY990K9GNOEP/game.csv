"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the deal, but $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the transaction.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. While I appreciate the compromise,  $9,250 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. ",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about we settle at $9,500?  This is a reasonable compromise that's fair to both of us.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $9,500 is getting closer, I'm still stuck at my budget limit.  How about $9,200? This is a good price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.  If you're not comfortable with this, I might have to explore other options.",9200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,200 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a happy middle ground. How about $9,350?  It's just a little bit more, but I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",9350.0,Alice,7,
