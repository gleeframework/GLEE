"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $15000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11500 is closer, I'm still hoping for something a bit higher to make this worthwhile for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $12250.  Let's close this deal!",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $12250 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $11000.  This is the absolute maximum I can go, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
