{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'll be watching his response carefully, and if he's too low, I can always fall back on selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$120 is way too low for me. It's below my minimum price, and I'd be losing money. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $160. It's still a decent profit for me, and it's closer to his initial offer. Hopefully, this will make him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with it.  It's barely above my minimum, and John is a guaranteed $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'll counter with $145.  This is a small increase from Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise, but it's also still above my minimum and closer to my desired profit. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not going to budge much higher. At this point, it's not worth risking more negotiation rounds with him. John offers a guaranteed $150, which is more than Bob's offer and meets my minimum.  I'm going to sell to John."
