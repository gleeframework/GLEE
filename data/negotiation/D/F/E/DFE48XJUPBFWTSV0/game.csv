"Bob, I believe this product has great potential for you, and I'm confident it can generate significant value for your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  $850,000 is a good starting point, but it's still below the value I believe this product holds.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This allows for a significant profit for you while still ensuring a fair return for me.  What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $925,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something under $900,000. Would you be willing to consider $880,000?",880000.0,Bob,4,
