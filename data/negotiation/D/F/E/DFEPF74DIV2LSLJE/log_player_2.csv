Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $910,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $915,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $915,000 is still too high for Bob.  He's only willing to go up to $910,000, and it seems like they're both dug in on their prices.  With only a few rounds left, it's not worth risking the deal falling apart entirely.  Bob should take the sure thing and buy from John for $800,000.  This ensures he gets the product at a good price and doesn't risk running out of time."
