"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product,  $1,000,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, as that's the maximum I can afford. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair compromise and  a price I can comfortably afford.  Let's make a deal!",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000.
