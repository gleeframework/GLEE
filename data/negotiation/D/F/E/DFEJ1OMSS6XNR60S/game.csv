"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $105? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $105 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $100? That's my absolute limit, and it would allow me to secure the product without going over budget.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is your limit, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? It's a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",102.5,Alice,5,
