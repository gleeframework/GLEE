Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.,1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1800000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its uniqueness. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is your maximum budget, but I still believe the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1400000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1400000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000. This would be a much better deal for me and still allows for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between your budget and the product's value. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's uniqueness and value.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
