"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I believe there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $8,000 simply wouldn't cover my costs. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $8500. This allows us to stay closer to my budget while still acknowledging the value of your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better deal. There are still 6 rounds left, and I'm confident I can negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250, which is a fair compromise for both of us. This price allows me to cover my costs and offers you a great deal on a product you know is valuable.  Let's close this deal, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Given the value of the product and my financial constraints, I would like to propose a final offer of $8750. This allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  While Bob's offer of $8,750 is better than his previous offers, it's still below my minimum threshold. With only four rounds remaining, I don't think I'll be able to reach a price that's satisfactory to me. John offers a guaranteed $10,000, which is the best outcome for me in this situation."
