Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 120} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good to start negotiations a bit higher than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your desired outcome.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""limited time"" and ""special price,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and value. 
* **Leaving Room:** Even if Bob finds the initial price too high, it gives us space to negotiate downwards, potentially settling closer to $100.

It's important to note that I haven't started at $100 (my minimum).  If I start there, there's no room to go down, and I risk losing Bob immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is more than what Bob initially valued the product at, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price and what John is offering. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a more agreeable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your position, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm signaling willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Targeting My Minimum:**  The $105 price point ensures I still make a profit and stay above my baseline of selling to John. 
* **Justification:** By suggesting ""meeting in the middle,"" I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $105. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  It's unlikely he'll reach a price point that's beneficial for me. Selling to John guarantees I get my desired profit without further negotiation."
