Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $10,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  However, $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's work together to find common ground.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $14,500 is still outside of my budget.  I'm committed to buying this product, but I can only go up to $13,000. This feels like a fair compromise considering both our positions.  Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his maximum offer of $13,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of him not reaching my minimum, and it's unlikely he'll drastically increase his offer in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and avoids further negotiation risk."
