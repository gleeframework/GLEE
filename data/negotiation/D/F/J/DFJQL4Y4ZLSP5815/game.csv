"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to pay $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is simply too far below my minimum asking price.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for me.  What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,3,
