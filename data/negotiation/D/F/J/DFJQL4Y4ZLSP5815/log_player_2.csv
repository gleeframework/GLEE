"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $18,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It's more advantageous for Bob to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to pay $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is simply too far below my minimum asking price.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for me.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $15,000 is still within Bob's budget, and it represents a significant discount from her initial offer. It's a reasonable deal considering the value of the product to Alice. While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal or having to pay more to John makes accepting the offer the best strategy in this round."
