"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $115?  I'm really interested in the product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $115 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $125 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to pay.  How about $120? That would be a fair price for both of us and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",120.0,Bob,4,
