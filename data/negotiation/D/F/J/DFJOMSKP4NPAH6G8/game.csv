"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,300,000 is significantly more than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, recognizing its potential value.  Let's find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too far from where I see this product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects the significant potential for return on your investment.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $2,000,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,700,000?  That reflects my desire to close this deal and recognizes the value you see.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering the potential value of the product. Let's aim for a deal that's good for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing your commitment to this deal, but we need to find a price that truly reflects the product's value. I can go as low as $1,550,000. This is my final offer. I believe it's a fair compromise.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
