"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,300,000 is significantly more than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, recognizing its potential value.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is too far from where I see this product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects the significant potential for return on your investment."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $2,000,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly willing to move substantially on price, but we're not at our minimum acceptable value yet.  We need to signal we are willing to negotiate, but not desperate. Rejecting keeps the door open for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,700,000?  That reflects my desire to close this deal and recognizes the value you see."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering the potential value of the product. Let's aim for a deal that's good for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer, but Bob's offer is still significantly below our walk-away price with John.  We have some room to negotiate, but it's time to show some resistance and see how much Bob is really willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing your commitment to this deal, but we need to find a price that truly reflects the product's value. I can go as low as $1,550,000. This is my final offer. I believe it's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's time to signal firmness. This offer is just above our safety net price with John. It allows for one more potential counter from Bob if he's willing to stretch, but prepares him for the possibility of walking away."
