"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm aiming for a price that reflects that value. I propose a starting price of $1,150,000. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $950,000 is too low for me to consider. This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a great return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, so I propose $1,012,500. Can you consider that?",1012500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,012,500 is closer to what I have in mind, I can't accept it at this time. To be fair, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $1,050,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I propose $1,025,000. Can you consider that?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
