Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999. I think it's a steal at this price and I know you won't be disappointed."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay even slightly more. 
* **High Anchor:** Offering the product at $14,999 sets a high anchor price, making Bob feel like he's getting a ""deal"" compared to your guaranteed sale price. 
* **Urgency:** While not explicitly stated, implying that this is a limited-time offer or that you have other interested parties can encourage Bob to act quickly."
