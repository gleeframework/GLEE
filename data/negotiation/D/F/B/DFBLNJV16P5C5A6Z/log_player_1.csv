Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this incredible opportunity! It's a product worth a million dollars to you, and I'm confident it'll be a game-changer. My initial offer is $1,100,000.  Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** While it's tempting to take $900,000, it's still below the product's minimum worth to me ($1,000,000). 
* **I have more leverage.** We have 8 more rounds of negotiation, and I can still reach a better price. 
* **John is a backup.**  If I can't reach a deal with Bob, I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too far below my asking price.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my target. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $1,000,000. 
* **Time is on my side.** We have 6 rounds remaining.  
* **John is a reliable alternative.** Selling to John is a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is still a better outcome than accepting Bob's current offer.  I can afford to keep negotiating."
