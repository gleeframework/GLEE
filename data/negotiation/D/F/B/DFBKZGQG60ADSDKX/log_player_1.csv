Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you a decent profit while still staying within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
