"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and allows me a healthy profit. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,300,000 is too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,400,000, which still leaves me a respectable profit while giving you a very good price. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $1,400,000 is still more than you'd like to pay.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get closer to your target price of $1,300,000.  Rejecting the offer will allow you to counter with a new price."
