"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. Would you consider selling the product for $500000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $500000 is simply too low for me. This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be worth much more to you in the long run.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $750000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your offer, but I still feel that $750000 is a bit high. Considering the current market conditions and the fact that I am not the only interested party, I would like to propose a price of $600000. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's do $650000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also recognizing your budget constraints.  I'm confident this will be a successful partnership for both of us.",650000.0,Alice,5,
