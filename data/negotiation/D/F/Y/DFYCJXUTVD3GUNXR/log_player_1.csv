Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I aim for a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) but below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to maximize my profit.
* **Strong Opening:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob and positions the price as a special consideration.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is $1,350,000, there's some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.

This strategy balances securing a high price from Bob while acknowledging the fallback option of selling to John for $1,000,000."
