{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high price, but I'm open to negotiation. Since I know the product is worth at least $80 to me, I'm willing to go lower if necessary.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value and be willing to pay a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'd rather sell to him than John for the same price, as it's possible to get a better price in future rounds."
