"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $20000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17000.  This is still a fair price considering the value you'll get.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a deal.  Let me know if you're interested in this price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $12000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $15000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $15000. I'm willing to go up to $13000. This is a fair price considering our previous negotiations. Let me know if you're willing to accept this final offer.",13000.0,Bob,6,
