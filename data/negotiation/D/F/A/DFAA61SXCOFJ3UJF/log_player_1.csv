Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I hope we can come to an agreement.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price. $1,200,000 is my floor, but I'd like to get closer to my initial offer if possible."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $1,250,000 is a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to settle for John's lower offer."
