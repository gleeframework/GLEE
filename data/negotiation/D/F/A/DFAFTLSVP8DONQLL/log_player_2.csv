"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. That's a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $100. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price to give us room for negotiation and signal that her initial price is unacceptable.
* **Polite and Open:** We want to maintain a positive tone to encourage continued bargaining.
* **Gauging Response:** This offer will help us understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $160? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved towards our price, $160 is still significantly above our $120 limit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests we might be able to get the price lower. 
* **John as Backup:**  We can always fall back on John's offer of $120 if we can't reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $160 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $110? That would be a great price for me."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're raising our offer by $10 to show Alice we're willing to negotiate, but we're still significantly below her price.
* **Targeting Just Below Budget:** Our goal is to get the product for under $120. Offering $110 puts us in a good position for a final deal.
* **Urgency:** As rounds progress, we might want to consider the value of time and the risk of losing the opportunity for a better price from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $135? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:** $135 is still above our $120 budget.
* **Final Offer:** Alice stating this is her final offer adds pressure, but it also means she might not be willing to go lower.
* **Strategic Counter:** We can use our next counteroffer to aim slightly below our budget, hoping Alice meets us in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  You're right, we're close!  How about $115, and we have a deal? "",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slightly Below Budget:** We're aiming slightly below our $120 maximum, hoping Alice might meet us in the middle to close the deal.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  We're getting close to our limit, both in terms of budget and rounds.  This offer conveys a desire to settle quickly.
* **Leaving Room for One More Round:**  If Alice rejects this offer, we have one more round to potentially negotiate or take John's offer."
