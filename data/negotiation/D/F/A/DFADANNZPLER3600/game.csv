"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget, I'd be willing to pay $1300000 for this product. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1300000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit more than I'm able to go. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1450000. This feels fair to both of us, and allows us to move forward.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1450000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer it to you for $1550000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you.
