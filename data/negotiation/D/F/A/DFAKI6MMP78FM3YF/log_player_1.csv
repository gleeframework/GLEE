"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high with $1,000,000. This is a strong opening position, signaling the value I place on the product.  It gives Bob a clear idea that I'm not willing to give it away cheaply. 

It's important to remember that John is my safety net, providing a guaranteed $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate without being overly pressured to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm not willing to sell for less than that, and I have a guaranteed $800,000 from John. There's still room for negotiation, so I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering $900,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a good profit margin. I'm hoping this shows my willingness to negotiate while also making it clear that I'm not desperate for a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. It's a good deal for me, and there's no reason to risk further negotiation. I'm happy to accept his offer and secure the sale."
