"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $950000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum price of $1,200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price. There's a good chance Alice is willing to go higher, especially since she mentioned the product being valuable to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $950,000 is a bit lower than I expected given the potential value to me.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $1100000. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe the product's value is substantial, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at your maximum price. There's no point in trying to negotiate further. You'd be risking losing the product to John, who will sell it to you at the same price.  Accepting Alice's offer saves you the hassle of further negotiations."
