"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my desired $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a significant improvement over Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my desired price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price before accepting. I'm not at a point where I'm desperate to sell, so I'm willing to risk further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,600,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm to a price that reflects the product's value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $1,150,000 is still too low. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation before accepting. I still believe I can get a better price and am not desperate to sell at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm now offering the product at my minimum acceptable price. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and shows Bob my commitment to reaching an agreement. If he still rejects, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like we're at an impasse.  Rather than risk further rounds with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price, I'm going to sell to John.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price."
