"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm only willing to pay $80 at this time. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $120 for the product. This still gives me a reasonable profit, and it's closer to your offer. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $120 is still a bit high for me. How about $95?  It's a fair compromise, and we can both get a good deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
