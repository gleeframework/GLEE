It's not worth buying the product from Alice at her price. It's better to make a counteroffer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."

I'm offering Alice my maximum price, hoping she'll be willing to negotiate to close the deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Alice's offer is still higher than my target price, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to accept this offer because it's still a better deal than buying from John, and there's a chance Alice might reject my counteroffer, leaving me with no product."
