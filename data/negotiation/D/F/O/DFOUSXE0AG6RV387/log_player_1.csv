Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and I'm confident it will be valuable to you. I'm asking for $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, I can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Emphasis on value:**  Instead of focusing solely on the price, I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob. This can justify a higher price in his mind. 
* **Open-ended question:** Ending with ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in the conversation rather than just giving a yes or no answer.

It's important to note that this is just an opening offer. I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob depending on his response, but I always have the safety net of John's offer."
