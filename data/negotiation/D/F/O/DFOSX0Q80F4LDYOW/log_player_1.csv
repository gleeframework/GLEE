"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob.  This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price. However, it's not an unreasonable price, so it's a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. I would like to propose $14000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is not a terrible price, it is below my minimum value of $15,000. I believe I can negotiate a better deal with Bob or sell to John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $14,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $16,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to meet my minimum price."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with $15500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is above my minimum price of $15,000 and is a good deal for me.  It's a win for both of us."
