Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a good price for you, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.
