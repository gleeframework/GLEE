"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product for $1,200,000. It's a significant value for you, and I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than her own valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still comfortably above her valuation. This leaves room for further negotiation while aiming for a price closer to Alice's perceived value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000? This price still gives you a significant advantage over buying from someone else, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we're still a ways off from a deal that truly benefits both of us. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get closer to a more favorable outcome."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you be open to $975,000?  That would be a strong offer on my end."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
``` 

This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's counteroffer and our previous offer. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly below Alice's initial offer."
