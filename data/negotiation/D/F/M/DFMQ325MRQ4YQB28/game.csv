"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000? This price still gives you a significant advantage over buying from someone else, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you be open to $975,000?  That would be a strong offer on my end.",975000.0,Bob,4,
