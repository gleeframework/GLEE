"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that I know you've been looking for, and I'm confident it's worth at least $10000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500. This is a great deal for both of us - I'll make a good profit, and you'll get a fantastic product at a lower price than you'd find anywhere else. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,500
* **John's offer:** $10,000

Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $10,000 is still within Bob's budget ($10,000) and saves him $500 compared to Alice's offer."
