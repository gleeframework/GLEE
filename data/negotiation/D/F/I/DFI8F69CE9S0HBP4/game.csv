"Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that I know you've been looking for, and I'm confident it's worth at least $10000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500. This is a great deal for both of us - I'll make a good profit, and you'll get a fantastic product at a lower price than you'd find anywhere else. Let me know if you're interested!",9500.0,Alice,1,
