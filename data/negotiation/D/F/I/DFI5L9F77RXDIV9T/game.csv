"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $9500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate you're interested in the product. While $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $9000?  That's still a great value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9000 is still a little above my budget, but I'm willing to go up to $8750. It's a fair price, and I think it's a good compromise. Let's finalize this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $8750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8900 as a final compromise. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good opportunity for you to get this valuable product.  Let's close the deal!",8900.0,Alice,5,
