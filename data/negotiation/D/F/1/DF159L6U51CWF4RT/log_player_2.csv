"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price, aiming to create a starting point for negotiations. He's offering $10,000, which is still a good deal for him, considering his maximum budget of $15,000 and the product's worth to Alice being $8,000.  This allows for potential back-and-forth negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. While $11,000 is still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer, it's a significant step down from Alice's original $12,000.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $4,000 compared to buying from John, which is a good outcome given the product's value to him. Further negotiation might save a bit more, but the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer or the deal falling apart entirely is too high."
