``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Buying from Alice saves you $150,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **The product is still worth more to you than the price Alice is asking.** You value it at $1,500,000 and she's selling it for $1,350,000, so it's a good deal for you."
