Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. It's a bit above my budget, and I'd like to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $90 is too low for me, and I'm hoping we can find a compromise.  I'm going to try to counter with a price closer to my desired range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $90 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to come down to $105.

Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to sell for that low. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I'm still not able to come down to $92.50. How about we split the difference and go with $98.75? I'm willing to make this final compromise to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 98.75}

Round 6

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $100. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before I consider selling to John."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $97.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. Bob and I have been going back and forth for a while, and it seems like we're not going to be able to agree on a price. It's better for me to get the $120 from John than to risk losing more time and potentially getting a lower offer from Bob."
