"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. It's a bit above my budget, and I'd like to get a better deal.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $90 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $92.50 for the product. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I'm still not able to come down to $92.50. How about we split the difference and go with $98.75? I'm willing to make this final compromise to come to an agreement.",98.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $98.75 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you at $97.50.  This is the absolute lowest I can go, and it's still a good deal for both of us.",97.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $97.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",95.0,Bob,8,
