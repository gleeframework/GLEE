"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to pay $7,500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","Bob's offer is too low.  I'll try to meet him closer to the middle.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're getting closer. I'm still a bit hesitant at $8,750. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,250? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
