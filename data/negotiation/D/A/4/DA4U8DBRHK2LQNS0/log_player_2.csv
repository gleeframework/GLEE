"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable item. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'd like to sell it to you for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product from John, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer at the same price. You might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice if you reject her initial offer."
