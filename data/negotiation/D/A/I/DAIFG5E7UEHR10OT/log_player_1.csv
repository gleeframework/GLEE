Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the interest I've already had, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to start negotiations with Bob above that to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** The $12,000 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, giving me a chance to lower the price slightly and still secure a better deal than $10,000. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies high demand (""interest I've already had"") to justify the high starting price. 
 
**Important Note:** It's crucial to gauge Bob's personality and negotiation style if possible. If he's known to be very price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective."
