"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:** I want to keep the conversation amicable to encourage Bob to stay engaged.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm not asking for the full $150 value, allowing Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $120. Would you be willing to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired $135. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but $120 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $127.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 127.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is fair for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Avoiding John:** While John is a backup option, I want to keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $122.50 for the product. This seems like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $122.50 is only $2.50 away from my minimum and very close to my desired price of $127.50.  It's time to accept and close the deal.  While I could try for a little more, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
