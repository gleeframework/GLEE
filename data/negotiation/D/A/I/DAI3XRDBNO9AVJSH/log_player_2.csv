"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $950000. This is a fair price considering its exceptional features and benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above your ideal price. You have room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  While I recognize its value, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for it. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong opening:**  A $150,000 counteroffer is a significant move, showing Alice you're serious about buying but also willing to negotiate.

* **Open to negotiation:**  The message ends by leaving the door open for further discussion, indicating you're flexible and willing to work with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your offer of $800000. I appreciate your willingness to invest in this product. However, considering its exceptional features and the value it can bring to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900000. This is a competitive price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What are your thoughts?

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible. $900,000 is a significant improvement, but I'm still a bit stretched. I'm willing to go up to $850,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counter:**  The counteroffer of $850,000 is a modest increase from your previous offer, showing you are still willing to negotiate but also setting a clear limit. 
* **Reinforces Value:**  You reiterate that you recognize the product's value but are constrained by your budget. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive tone, emphasizing your willingness to find a solution."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, considering the product's exceptional value and the benefits it can bring, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price.  At $875,000, the deal is within your budget and represents a good saving compared to buying from John.
