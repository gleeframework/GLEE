"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $950000. This is a fair price considering its exceptional features and benefits. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  While I recognize its value, $950000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $800000 for it. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion. What are your thoughts?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thank you for your offer of $800000. I appreciate your willingness to invest in this product. However, considering its exceptional features and the value it can bring to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900000. This is a competitive price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for being flexible. $900000 is a significant improvement, but I'm still a bit stretched. I'm willing to go up to $850000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, considering the product's exceptional value and the benefits it can bring, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.
