Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be incredibly valuable for you.  I'm asking for $18,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This gives you room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Value-Based Language:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, rather than just focusing on the price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Offering $18,000 leaves space to potentially negotiate down to a price that's still significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  Depending on your knowledge of Bob and your risk tolerance, you might choose a different approach."
