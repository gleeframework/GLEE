"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!",850000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is significantly below what the product is worth.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $775,000? This allows me some room to negotiate while still giving you a great price.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $775,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.  Would you consider $737,500?",737500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $737,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $762,500? This is a fair compromise, and allows us both to get what we need.",762500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $750,000.  This is a competitive offer considering I could buy it from John for $800,000.",750000.0,Bob,6,
