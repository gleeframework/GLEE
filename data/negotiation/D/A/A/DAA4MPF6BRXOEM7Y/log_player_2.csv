"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $100 for it. I hope you find this offer attractive and look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $100 is better than Alice's original value of $120, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, aiming to close the gap quickly. $85 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation and avoids immediately going to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to consider your offer. However, I need to maintain a minimum profit margin. Therefore, I propose a price of $90 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still providing a reasonable return for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her offer, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob can likely get the product for cheaper if he continues negotiating, especially since John is offering it for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88 for the product. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway by offering a price that's closer to his budget and John's offer.  This shows he's serious about buying but still wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for considering my previous offers, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of our discussions, I am willing to adjust my price slightly. I propose a final offer of $89 for the product. This price allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while being competitive in the market. I hope this offer is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $89 is still higher than John's offer of $80. While it's tempting to take the deal, Bob has managed to negotiate down significantly and is likely to get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  There's also a good chance Alice will come down further to avoid losing the sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $89 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $87.  This is my final offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his maximum budget, but he's still trying to squeeze out a better price. This offer is closer to John's price, creating pressure on Alice to accept. It's a high-stakes move, but Bob needs to find out if Alice is willing to meet him halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I've reviewed our previous discussions and I'm prepared to offer the product at $88. This price allows us both to reach an agreement that is fair and within your budget. I hope you'll find this proposal satisfactory. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal for Bob.  Alice has come down to $88, which is just $8 above John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale to John, and there's no guarantee Alice will come down further.  This is a reasonable price for the product, and Bob should accept it."
