# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that should be acceptable to both of us.
