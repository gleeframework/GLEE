Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a new offer of $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to compromise to make the sale happen.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $12,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $12,000.  At this point, accepting John's offer of $10,000 is the best way to guarantee I stay within my $10,000 budget and still acquire the product."
