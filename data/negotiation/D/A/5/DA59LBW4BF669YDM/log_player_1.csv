Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other potential buyers.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still leaves room for him to see potential profit if he can leverage the product effectively.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 
* **Open Communication:** The message invites a discussion, allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price within the desired range."
