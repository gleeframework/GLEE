"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price, significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. This is a common negotiation tactic to gauge Bob's interest and see if he is willing to pay a premium for the product.  

This is a risky move, but it allows for potential greater profits if Bob is indeed interested in the product and willing to pay a high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, it's still below my initial asking price and doesn't reflect the product's true value. I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still maintaining a significant profit margin.  This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, while also demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my ideal price. While it's still not the full $1,500,000 I initially hoped for, it's a substantial amount.  We're already four rounds in, and I want to avoid risking further rejections and potentially ending up with John's lower offer.  Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of a drawn-out negotiation."
