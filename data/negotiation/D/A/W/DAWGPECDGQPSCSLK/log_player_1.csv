**Reasoning:**

Bob seems firmly rooted at a price point significantly lower than desirable. He hasn't budged much from his initial offer, and waiting around for him to potentially reach a more acceptable price isn't worth the risk of losing the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  It's time to move on to a more promising buyer."
