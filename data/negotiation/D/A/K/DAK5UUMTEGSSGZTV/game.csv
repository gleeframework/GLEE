"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm asking for $900,000.  This is a significant discount from its true worth and gives you a substantial opportunity for profit. I'm confident you'll find this offer very appealing.",900000.0,Alice,1,
