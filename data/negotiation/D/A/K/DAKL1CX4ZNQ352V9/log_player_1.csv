"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  $8,500 is still too low for me, and I have a backup buyer in John.  I think I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $9,000? It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $8,750? I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my desired price, $8,750 is still too low. I'm confident I can push for a higher price with John as my backup buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not there yet. $8,750 is a bit too far off from what I need.  I'm willing to meet you halfway *one more time* and offer $8,875.  This is my final concession, and I hope you see the value in accepting.  Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 8875}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your final concession, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's as high as I can go. I hope you can meet me halfway again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,800 is a good deal for me considering it is a little above my minimum desired value and it is unlikely he'll offer any higher. Also, we are nearing the end of the negotiation and John is waiting in the wings. So I'll accept the offer and secure the sale."
