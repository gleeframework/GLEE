"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this great product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer matches the minimum price I'm willing to accept. However, I already have John offering the same price without further negotiation. It makes more sense to sell to John and avoid the risk of Bob changing his mind or further haggling in later rounds."
