"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,500. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $14,500 is less than what he's willing to pay, it's still a good starting point for negotiation.  He's better off seeing if he can get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $13,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that's fair to both of them. He's starting with a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than Alice's minimum price point. This counteroffer will help gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is closer to his target price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's not desperate enough to accept yet, as he still has several rounds left and John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $14,000 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  I'm pretty serious about getting this product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, offering a price that is closer to Alice's last offer.  He is aiming to find a price that is acceptable to both parties, but he also wants to be sure he is getting the best deal possible.  This counteroffer is a compromise that demonstrates his willingness to negotiate."
