"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for my budget.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to keep my spending under control. Would you consider $5,000? It's a significant offer that might work for both of us.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $5,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $9,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. That said, $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $6,500? That feels like a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a fair compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $6,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,5,
