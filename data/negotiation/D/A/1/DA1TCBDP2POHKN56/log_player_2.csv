"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than my budget and John's offer. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for my budget.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to keep my spending under control. Would you consider $5,000? It's a significant offer that might work for both of us."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic Start:**  Starting significantly lower than Alice's offer aims to bring the price down quickly. While $5,000 is a large difference, it establishes my budget limitations clearly.
* **Polite and Respectful Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation amicable and avoids offending Alice.
* **Justification:**  Briefly explaining my budgetary constraints helps Alice understand my position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $5,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $9,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $9,000 is still higher than John's offer. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. That said, $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $6,500? That feels like a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Steady Progression:**  Offering $6,500 is a significant jump from my previous offer, but it keeps the negotiation moving and shows Alice I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Targeting Below John's Price:** My goal is to secure a price lower than John's $8,000 offer.
* **Seeking Common Ground:** By suggesting $6,500, I aim for a middle ground that might be appealing to Alice while staying within a reasonable range for myself."
