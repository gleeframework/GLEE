Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it is getting closer, I still have a few rounds left to negotiate a better price.  It's important to remember that the longer we negotiate, the more likely Alice is to drop her price to close the deal."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer, and it's exactly my maximum budget. With only two rounds remaining, there's significant pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the deal. By offering my maximum, I'm signaling that I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't accept."
