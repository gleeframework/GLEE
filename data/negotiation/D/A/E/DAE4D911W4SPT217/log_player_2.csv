"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* $900,000 is still too high for Bob. 
* There are 9 more rounds left, giving Bob the opportunity to negotiate a lower price. 
* Buying from John at $800,000 is always an option, so Bob has no immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to get as close to his maximum budget as possible while still leaving room for negotiation.
* Offering $750,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's seriousness in negotiating.
* This price is still below Alice's minimum value, leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

*  While $850,000 is closer to Bob's budget, he's still determined to save more.
*  There are 7 rounds remaining, offering ample opportunity for further negotiation.
*  Buying from John for $800,000 is still a viable option, making Bob less pressured to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget, but still wants to secure the best possible price.
* Offering $800,000 is a strong compromise, showing Bob's willingness to meet halfway.
* This price is still below Alice's minimum value, but it's the price Bob is willing to pay without going to John.
* With 6 rounds left, there's still room for negotiation, but Bob doesn't want to risk losing the deal to another buyer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* This is a very close call, but considering the limited rounds remaining (5), the potential loss of the deal to another buyer, and the small difference between Alice's offer and Bob's budget, it's the most logical choice. 
* Accepting the offer secures the product while still staying within Bob's budget with a minimal compromise. 
* Going to John at this point could potentially lead to a better price but risks losing the deal altogether. 
* While Bob could continue negotiating, the remaining rounds are limited, and the chance of getting a better price is slim."
