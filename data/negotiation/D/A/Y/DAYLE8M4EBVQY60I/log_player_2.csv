# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is interesting, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair compromise that I believe will benefit both of us.

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price point, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $950,000 is still higher than my target price of $875,000, and it's unlikely she'll go lower. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $1,200,000. This ensures I get the product while staying within my budget."
