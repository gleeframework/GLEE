"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can try to get a lower price.
* **John's offer is your fallback.** If you can't get a better price from Alice, you have a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your asking price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's, showing your willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justified:** You're offering a price that still leaves room for Alice to make a profit while staying within your budget.
* **Sets a clear starting point:** This counteroffer provides a solid foundation for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 isn't quite meeting my needs. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she's lowered her price, it's still above your desired price point.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  Alice is showing flexibility, so there's likely still room to bargain for a lower price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** You can always fall back on John's offer if you can't reach a better agreement with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's find common ground and finalize this purchase."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight increase:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to meet Alice halfway, but still staying within your budget.
* **Emphasis on compromise:** You're framing this as a fair solution for both parties, aiming to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative approach encourages Alice to continue the negotiation."
