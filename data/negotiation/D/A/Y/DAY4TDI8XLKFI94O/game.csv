"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your asking price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 isn't quite meeting my needs. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,250,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's find common ground and finalize this purchase.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
