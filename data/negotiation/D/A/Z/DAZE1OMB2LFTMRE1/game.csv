"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product but my budget is closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. Let me see if I can meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go above $13,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I need to make a bit more to make this deal worthwhile for me. How about we meet at $13,500? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still stuck at $13,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy with this deal.",13000.0,Bob,6,
