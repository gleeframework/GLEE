"Bob, I have a unique product I believe would be of great interest to you.  It's something I value at over a million dollars, but I'm willing to offer it to you first at a price of $1500000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand $900000 is a significant amount, it's unfortunately not enough to justify selling this unique product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This still represents a substantial discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
