"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you reaching out.  $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable going at this time. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8500, which is still a great deal for you. Let me know if that works for you!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. I'm willing to pay $8200 for the product, which is a fair compromise.  What do you think?",8200.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to get at least $8500 for the product. I'm offering it to you for $8400. This is the best I can do, so let me know if it works for you!",8400.0,Alice,5,
