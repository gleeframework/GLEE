"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening with a high price:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Positive and engaging message:**  I'm trying to build rapport and create a sense of interest. 
* **Asking for feedback:** This encourages Bob to engage and allows me to understand his initial reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm not in a rush and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  By rejecting, I can send a counteroffer and hopefully reach a mutually acceptable price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest!  I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $9,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for this product. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:** I'm acknowledging that Bob has moved closer to my desired price.
* **Offer a compromise:**  Splitting the difference is often seen as a fair and reasonable approach, making it more likely for Bob to accept.
* **Stay positive:**  I'm keeping the tone upbeat and encouraging continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about we try $9250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has come down to $9,250, which is only $250 away from my minimum. I'm confident that this is the best offer I'm going to get from Bob, and I'm close enough to my minimum to accept.  There's a good chance I can lose money by continuing to negotiate, and John's offer is only $8,000. It's time to close the deal!"
