"Hi Alice, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but I can't go down to $90.  How about $105?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you have to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $100 for it.  Let me know if you're willing to go that low.",100.0,Bob,4,
