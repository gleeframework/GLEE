I'm starting with a low offer to see if there's any wiggle room.  I'm confident I can get a better deal than $80 from John, so I'll keep negotiating with Alice for now."

We're getting close, but Alice is still asking more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to cut my losses and buy from John.  It's better to get the product now than keep negotiating and potentially miss out on a good deal."
