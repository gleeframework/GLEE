The product is worth no more than $8,000 to you, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}

I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. This shows I'm serious about buying, but also that I'm not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.
