This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I believe we can reach a better agreement. How about I offer to purchase your product for $1,350,000? This still allows me to save some money while getting the product I need. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my desired price point. I'm going to counter with a higher offer, hoping to secure a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price is still fair, considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'll try one last time. How about $1,380,000? This still gives me some savings, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,380,000

Bob's offer is very close to my desired price point. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for a much lower price. I'll accept Bob's offer and secure the deal."
