Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, however.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,150,000.  This reflects both the value of the product to you and the fact that I can sell it elsewhere for $1,200,000.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he can still get the product from John for $1,200,000, Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is a better deal."
