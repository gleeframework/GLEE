,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100. Let me know if you're open to that.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just too low. I'm willing to come down to $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $175 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $137.50. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",137.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $137.50 is still below my minimum. How about we split the difference and go with $150? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done. ",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm trying to stay within my budget. $150 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to go up to $140. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's close this deal.",140.0,Bob,6,
