Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offers are escalating too slowly.  At this pace, it's unlikely we'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's guaranteed $10,000 offer within the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
