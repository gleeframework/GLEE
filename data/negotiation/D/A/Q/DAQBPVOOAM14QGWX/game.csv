"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $2,300,000. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. This product has tremendous value that I'm confident will benefit you greatly. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer to a deal that works for both of us.  While I believe this product is worth every penny of my initial offer, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,950,000. This reflects the product's true value and my willingness to find a compromise.",1950000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit higher from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,850,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1850000.0,Bob,6,
