"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I understand your perspective, $12,000 is significantly below its value. Could you consider $18,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $14,000. That's the highest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the market value.",14000.0,Bob,4,
