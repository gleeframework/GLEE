"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price would allow me to make a profit while still keeping the deal within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer.  While $850,000 is closer to my goal, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price allows for both of us to profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to my range, I'm still hoping for a better price. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise and allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's see if we can agree on this.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $900,000 is getting closer to what I need.  However, I'm still willing to negotiate.  I'm prepared to accept $925,000 for the product. This price would allow me to make a profit while still giving you a fantastic deal.  Let's finalize this and close the deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
