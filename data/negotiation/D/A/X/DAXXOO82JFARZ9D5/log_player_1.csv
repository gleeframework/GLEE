Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening move that demonstrates the value I place on the product. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate, but I want to see if he's truly interested in this level of investment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is still a significant amount of money, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows good faith while still being close to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $850,000 is above my minimum threshold of $800,000 and a good price given the negotiation.  It's not my ideal price, but I've successfully negotiated up from his initial offer. It's time to close the deal."
