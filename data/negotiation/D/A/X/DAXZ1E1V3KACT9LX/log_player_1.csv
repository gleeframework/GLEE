{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price as close to my minimum of $10,000 as possible, but I'm also acknowledging that Bob values the product at $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation.  

I'm optimistic that Bob will counteroffer, giving me the opportunity to further negotiate and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price. However, if Bob rejects my offer, I have the backup option of selling to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a drastic reduction. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I can stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'm not willing to compromise any further. I'll make one final counteroffer before selling to John."
