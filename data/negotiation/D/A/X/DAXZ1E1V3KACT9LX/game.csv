"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this deal!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I can stay within my means.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $8,750 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $9,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",9250.0,Alice,5,
