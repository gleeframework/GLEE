I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,250,000. This is a fair starting point, as it's slightly above the minimum I'm willing to accept, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't sell for less than $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
