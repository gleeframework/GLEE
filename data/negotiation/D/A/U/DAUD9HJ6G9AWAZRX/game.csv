"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is a fair price given my budget and the value I see in it.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9000. I'm sure we can find a way to reach a deal that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $9000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, and I'm proposing $10250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and come to an agreement.",10250.0,Alice,5,
