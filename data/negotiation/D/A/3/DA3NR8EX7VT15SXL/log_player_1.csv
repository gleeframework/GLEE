Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $13,000 is a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This would allow us both to make a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.
