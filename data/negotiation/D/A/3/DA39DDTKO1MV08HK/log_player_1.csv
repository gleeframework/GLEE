Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let's make this happen! "", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to my ideal outcome, but still leaving room for negotiation.  
* **Appealing to Bob's Interests:**  I'm emphasizing the value to Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The wording is positive and leaves the door open for further discussion.

**Why not go higher?:**

* It's risky to start too high. Bob might immediately reject and I could lose valuable negotiation time. 
*  My backup option with John provides a safety net, so I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $850,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly less than my ideal price and what the product is worth to Bob. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's room for negotiation.  Bob is clearly interested, and his counteroffer shows he's willing to pay more than John.  I want to try and get closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than his. This will show I'm willing to negotiate but am also confident in the product's value."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal. I'm willing to come down a bit to $900,000,  which is still a fantastic price considering the product's value to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but I'm not giving in entirely.  
* **Focus on Value:** I'm still emphasizing the product's value to Bob, making it more appealing to him. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication positive and open to finding a mutually beneficial solution.

**Why not go lower?:**

* I'm still aiming for a price significantly higher than John's offer. 
*  Bob's initial counteroffer was $850,000, and my counteroffer is only $50,000 higher than that. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but am not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above John's Offer:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still above what John is willing to pay. This means I'm still in a good position to negotiate further.
* **Room for Improvement:** I believe there's still room to get closer to my desired price. Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, and I'm confident I can convince him to go a little higher.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my previous one, but still higher than his current offer. This will demonstrate that I'm willing to compromise but also that I believe the product is worth more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to save money, but $875,000 is still a bit low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $887,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to finalize the sale.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 887500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a middle ground between Bob's last offer and my previous one. It shows a willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Emphasis on Finality:** I'm mentioning ""finalizing the sale"" to encourage Bob to accept, as he's already been through several rounds of negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The tone is still positive and encouraging, aiming to maintain a good relationship.

**Why not go lower:** 

* This offer is still significantly higher than John's offer, giving me a better outcome.
* It's a small step closer to my ideal price, demonstrating that I'm not giving up easily."
