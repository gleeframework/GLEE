I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

$100 is too low for me.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility, but still keeping it above my minimum.  Hopefully, this is a reasonable compromise for Bob."

Bob is unwilling to budge.  While I would prefer to get more, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially getting an even lower offer. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, so that's the best option at this point."
