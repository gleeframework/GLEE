"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $22,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, however,  $10,000 is quite a ways from where I can make a deal. Could you consider something closer to $18,000? ",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $14,000.  This is my final offer, I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
