"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming to get more than $100, which is your minimum.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $150, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It's a friendly opening:**  The message is positive and encourages Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is better than selling to John for $100, it's still significantly lower than your desired price.  Since you have 10 rounds and Bob is clearly interested, you have room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counter-offer closer to your preferred price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
