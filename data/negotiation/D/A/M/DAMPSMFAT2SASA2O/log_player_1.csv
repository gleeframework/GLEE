{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's fair considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's slightly below my minimum price of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation while still being a good profit for me. I want to see if Bob will bite, and if not, we can start a back-and-forth.  I'll be ready to counter his offer or walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8500. Would you be willing to accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $9,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my end, but it still allows me to get a fair price.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. "", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, aiming to meet Bob halfway while still being above my minimum.  Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to accept the deal, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $8500 again, as I mentioned earlier. If you're not willing to go that low, I'm starting to consider buying from John for $8000. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to budge much, and I'm losing time and energy in this negotiation.  I'm not comfortable selling for $8,500.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $10,000. It's a guaranteed deal, and I'll get a much better price."
