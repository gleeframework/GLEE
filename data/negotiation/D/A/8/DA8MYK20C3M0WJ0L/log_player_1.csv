{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm hoping he sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I'm going to try and counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial asking price.  I believe the product has value beyond what Bob is currently offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping he sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob has come up to $16,000, which is a good price considering my minimum value. I'm happy to accept his offer and move on."
