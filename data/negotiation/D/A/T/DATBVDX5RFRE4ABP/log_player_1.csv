{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It acknowledges the value the product holds for Bob while still leaving a substantial profit for myself. I'm confident Bob will find this offer appealing, but if he rejects it, I'm prepared to counter his offer and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $750,000? I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob, and I'm confident in my ability to get a price closer to my desired range.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This still offers you a significant gain while ensuring I receive a fair price for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to propose $800,000 as the price for the product. This is the highest I can go, considering its value to me. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and while I'd prefer to get more, it's a good deal considering the potential for further negotiation to drag on. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely."
