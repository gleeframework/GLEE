"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500.  It's a great deal, as you know it's worth more to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,500 is better than John's price, it's still above what the product is worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $13,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,750? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,750 is a good compromise. It's closer to Bob's target price of $13,000, and it's still significantly lower than John's price of $15,000.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to save money and get the product.  There's always a chance of getting a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or the negotiation collapsing entirely is too high.  Accepting the offer secures the deal and avoids potential losses."
