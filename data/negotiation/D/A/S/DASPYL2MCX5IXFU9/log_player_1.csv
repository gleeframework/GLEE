Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $1,150,000 is a significant amount, it's still lower than my minimum value. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,180,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,160,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.
