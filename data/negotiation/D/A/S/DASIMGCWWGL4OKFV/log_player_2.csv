"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $100 and Alice is offering the product at $100, it's the same price as John's offer. You might as well accept Alice's offer, as there's no financial advantage to buying from John instead."
