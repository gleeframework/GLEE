"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 is a significant undervaluation of what this product can bring to your business. Let's meet in the middle – how about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is worth a lot, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be upfront – I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. To make this work for me, I need to stay firm at $1,300,000.  This is my final offer.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to pay $1,300,000, and I'm also not willing to give up on the deal. I'm willing to go a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think $1,200,000 is still a fair price. How about we meet at $1,220,000?",1220000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid we're too far apart.  My absolute bottom line is $1,275,000. This takes into account the other offer I have on the table.  Let me know if this works for you.",1275000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have another offer on the table, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, which is the midpoint between my previous offer and your current offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
