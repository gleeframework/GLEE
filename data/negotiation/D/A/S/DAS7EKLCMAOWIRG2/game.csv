"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $200 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $150 for it. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I would like to make a special offer for you. If you agree to purchase the product within the next 24 hours, I can lower the price to $180. This is still a premium price considering the quality and value of the product, but I believe it's a fair compromise given your current budget. Please let me know if this works for you.",180.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $180 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to go with your initial offer of $150, or I can unfortunately move on to another vendor. ",150.0,Bob,4,
