"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-end item. I believe you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll be willing to pay a premium for it. I'm starting with an offer of $12000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",8000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $8000 feels a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to consider purchasing for $6000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $6000 is a bit lower than you were hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $9000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $9500. This is a price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a good deal for you. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $9500 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8500.  This price is a significant compromise for me and represents a fair value for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,6,
