# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal for you, as the value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can initiate a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, though. How about $9,000? That's still a good deal for you, as it's significantly lower than what you'd be getting from John.  Let's see if we can make this work.
