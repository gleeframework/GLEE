"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is $2,000 above Bob's maximum price.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $17,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $16000. This is still a good deal for both of us, as the product is worth significantly more to you. Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum price. There's still room to negotiate, and Bob should aim to secure a price closer to his $15,000 limit.  He can try to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on $15,500? This price would be a good compromise for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15500}
