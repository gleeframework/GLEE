"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product. It's a game-changer in the industry and I think you'll really appreciate its features. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that price is significantly higher than my budget. While I recognize the value of your product, I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time.  This is my maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is my best price, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still outside of my range. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it brings, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
