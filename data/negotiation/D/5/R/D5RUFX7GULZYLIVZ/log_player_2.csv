Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price.

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I've already spent several rounds and I'm running out of time. It's better to secure the product from John at a price I'm comfortable with."
