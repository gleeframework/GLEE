"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Could we settle on $950,000? I feel that's a fair offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
