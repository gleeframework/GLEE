"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $120 is higher than the $80 Bob values the product, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  It's below your minimum of $150, giving you room to make concessions later.
* **It's a clear opening:** It's a straightforward offer that allows Bob to easily understand your starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is above Bob's perceived value of $80, it's still significantly below my minimum of $150. I'm not willing to accept such a low price this early in the negotiation.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range, increasing my chances of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about $105? I'm still willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I reiterate my willingness to work with Bob, keeping the negotiation amicable. 
* **Leave room for further negotiations:** $105 is still a good starting point for further discussions, allowing for potential concessions if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still really interested in the product, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85. Can you meet me in the middle at $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $92.50 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum of $150. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price yet. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and try to reach a price closer to my target. There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can achieve a better outcome by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $92.50 is still a bit too low.  Let's try to find some middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Continuing to negotiate:** I'm still rejecting Bob's offer but showing flexibility by coming down slightly from my previous offer.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I'm framing $100 as a ""fair price"" for both of us.
* **Expressing confidence in the product:** Highlighting the value of the product is a subtle tactic to encourage Bob to accept.

I'm still aiming to get a price closer to my desired $150, but I'm also willing to compromise to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $87.50. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only four rounds left, the negotiation is getting close to a stalemate. Bob's offer of $87.50 is still significantly below my minimum of $150, and I'm not sure I can get him to budge much more.  

Since John is willing to buy the product for my minimum price of $150, it makes sense to sell to him. This guarantees me my desired profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
