"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's make this happen!",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000,  which is still a significant discount from what it's worth to me.  Let's try to find a compromise here.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1,700,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. Can you consider this compromise?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,550,000.  This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll be moving on to another buyer.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you reconsider your final offer?",1450000.0,Bob,6,
