Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000,  which is still a significant discount from what it's worth to me.  Let's try to find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter again, but I'm prepared to sell to John if this doesn't work out."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,550,000.  This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll be moving on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you reconsider your final offer?

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I've reached my limit. I'm confident that I can get my desired price from John, so I'm going to sell to him."
