"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy my product from you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make a reasonable offer to get us started. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's still significant room for negotiation.  Since you have 10 rounds and a backup option with John, it's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit too high for me at this stage. Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering our conversation, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850000. This is a fair price, taking into account the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to my target, but it's still higher than I'm willing to pay right now. Since I have 10 rounds and a backup option with John, I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm happy to come up to $800,000.  Let's see if we can bridge this gap and get a deal done."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're close to a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go down to $800000 just yet. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair price, taking into account our previous offers and the product's worth to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is close to my target price of $800,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's getting late in the game, and it's likely that the price won't drop much lower.  Accepting this offer saves me $675,000 compared to buying from John."
