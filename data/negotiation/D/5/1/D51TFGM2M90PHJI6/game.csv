"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy my product from you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make a reasonable offer to get us started. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900000 is a bit too high for me at this stage. Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $750000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering our conversation, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850000. This is a fair price, taking into account the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm happy to come up to $800000.  Let's see if we can bridge this gap and get a deal done.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that we're close to a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go down to $800000 just yet. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair price, taking into account our previous offers and the product's worth to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,5,
