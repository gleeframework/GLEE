"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's value of $12,000. This indicates there's room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, so he starts with a counteroffer of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it leaves room for negotiation if Alice rejects it.  It's also below Bob's maximum budget, giving him some wiggle room."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price.  While it's closer to his maximum budget, it's still not ideal. Bob can continue negotiating for a lower price by rejecting and sending another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  His previous offer of $10,000 was too low, and Alice countered with $14,000, which is too high. A counteroffer of $11,000 is a compromise that could be acceptable to both parties. It's still a good deal for Bob, and it's closer to Alice's perceived value of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still a bit higher than Bob's preferred price. He's already made a counteroffer, and Alice rejected it. This indicates that Alice is willing to negotiate further.  Bob should continue trying to get a better price by rejecting and sending another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget, but he's still trying to save as much money as possible. A counteroffer of $12,500 is a good compromise. It's halfway between Alice's last offer of $13,500 and Bob's previous offer of $11,000. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product but still wants a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,500 is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. However, there's still a chance for negotiation, especially since Alice has rejected Bob's counteroffers in the previous rounds. This suggests that Alice might be willing to go a little lower to close the deal. Bob should try to get a better price by rejecting and sending another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his limit.  Alice's offer is getting closer to his maximum price, but he's still trying to save some money.  A counteroffer of $13,000 is a compromise,  showing he's serious about buying but still wants a better deal.  This gives Alice a bit more to work with without going over Bob's maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,250 is very close to Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. While it's tempting to try for another counteroffer, there's only one round left. If Alice rejects Bob's counteroffer, he'll be forced to buy from John at $15,000.  

It's better to be safe than sorry. Bob should take the sure thing and buy from John for $15,000. He'll save $750 compared to accepting Alice's offer and will also avoid the risk of Alice rejecting his final counteroffer."
