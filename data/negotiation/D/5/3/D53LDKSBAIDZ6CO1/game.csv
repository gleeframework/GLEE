"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that I know will be of great benefit to your business. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we bring it down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's keep the negotiation moving forward.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $1,150,000. Would that be agreeable to you?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $1,150,000 still leaves me with a significant loss.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our needs. Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we both want to close this deal. How about we settle at $1,175,000? It's a strong offer that shows I'm serious about buying.",1175000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm ready to close this deal.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,187,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a successful transaction for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",1187500.0,Alice,7,
