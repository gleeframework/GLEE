"Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $135 is a decent price, you can likely get a better deal by rejecting the offer and counter-offering. You know the product is worth $150 to Alice, and you're willing to pay up to $120. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $125. This is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer of $135, but it's still within my budget and leaves room for further negotiation. I'm hoping Alice will see that this is a fair price, considering the product's value to her and my willingness to pay up to $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $140 is still too high for me. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget. I will continue to negotiate with Alice in hopes of getting a better price.  If she doesn't budge, I'll go with John's offer of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm sticking with a counteroffer close to my maximum budget, but offering a slight increase from my previous counteroffer.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still unwilling to pay her full asking price. I'm hoping this compromise will be enough to get her to accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is clearly unwilling to budge from her position.  Her offer of $145 is higher than my maximum budget, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation that might result in even higher prices.  I've already spent a few rounds trying to negotiate, and it's clear I'm not going to get the product for my ideal price. Therefore, it's time to secure the product from John for $120, which is the best deal I can get at this point."
