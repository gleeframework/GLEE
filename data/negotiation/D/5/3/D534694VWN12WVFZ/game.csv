"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $12000 by you. Considering its high quality and unique features, I am proposing an initial price of $10000. I believe this offers a fair balance between value and cost for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Given the high value you place on the product, I propose we meet in the middle with a price of $9250. I hope this proposal works for you and moves us closer to closing the deal.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $8500. This represents a fair value for the product, and I'm confident we can find common ground at this price.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I respect your valuation of the product. In light of this, I would like to propose a price of $9000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, aiming to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I hope you find this proposal acceptable.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $9000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8750. This reflects a fair value for the product, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal.",8750.0,Bob,6,
