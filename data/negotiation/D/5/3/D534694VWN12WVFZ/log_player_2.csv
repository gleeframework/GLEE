"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $12000 by you. Considering its high quality and unique features, I am proposing an initial price of $10000. I believe this offers a fair balance between value and cost for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's initial offer is better than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating. There are 9 rounds left, so there's ample opportunity to try and bring the price down further."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Given the high value you place on the product, I propose we meet in the middle with a price of $9250. I hope this proposal works for you and moves us closer to closing the deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his ideal range. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially secure an even lower price.  There are 7 rounds left, so continuing to negotiate is the most strategic move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $8,500. This represents a fair value for the product, and I'm confident we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I respect your valuation of the product. In light of this, I would like to propose a price of $9000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, aiming to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I hope you find this proposal acceptable.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still not within his ideal range.  Bob is willing to pay $8,500, and he has 5 rounds remaining to try and secure a better deal. He can still potentially get a lower price, so it's advantageous to continue negotiating."
