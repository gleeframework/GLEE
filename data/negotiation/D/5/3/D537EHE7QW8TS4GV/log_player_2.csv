Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and more than what I'm willing to sell it for. Let me know what you think.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  $1,100,000 is still a great deal for you, given the product's value to you. However, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,125,000. This reflects a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's make this happen!
