"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to you, and there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is still significantly below the product's worth to me. I believe this is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. After re-evaluating the market and considering your offer, I'm willing to lower the price to $950000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a slight improvement, it's still lower than your counteroffer.  You've demonstrated a willingness to compromise and it's likely Alice can come up a little more.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter again, potentially reaching a price closer to your desired $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $950,000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm prepared to pay $975,000 for the product. This is a fair middle ground that acknowledges the value of the product while also ensuring we can both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you at $965000. This is a slight concession from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm eager to finalize the deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $965,000 is only $10,000 away from your last counteroffer of $975,000.  With only 5 rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate may not yield a significant enough price difference to justify the risk. Accepting the offer secures a good deal and avoids the potential of Alice becoming more stubborn in future rounds, or even rejecting your next counteroffer.  While you might be able to get a slightly better price, the potential gains are not worth the risk of losing the deal."
