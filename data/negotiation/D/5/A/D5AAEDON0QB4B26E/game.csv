"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to pay $1000000, which is still significantly below the product's worth to me. I believe this is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. After re-evaluating the market and considering your offer, I'm willing to lower the price to $950000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $950000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm prepared to pay $975000 for the product. This is a fair middle ground that acknowledges the value of the product while also ensuring we can both walk away satisfied.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you at $965000. This is a slight concession from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm eager to finalize the deal and move forward.",965000.0,Alice,5,
