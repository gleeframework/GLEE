"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. It's an exceptional piece that holds significant value for us and we believe it will be equally beneficial for you. Considering its worth and the benefits it offers, I am offering it to you for $12,000. This price reflects a fair compromise between its value to us and its perceived value to you. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both parties. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000. Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to reject Alice's offer and proceed with purchasing from John."
