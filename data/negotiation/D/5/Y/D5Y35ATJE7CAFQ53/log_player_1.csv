"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point as it's a fair price for both of us - it's above my minimum acceptable price and below Bob's maximum willingness to pay.  I'm hoping we can reach a deal quickly, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is above my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that price just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can potentially get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. It's a slight increase from Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise. It's also still a good price for Bob as it's below his maximum willingness to pay.  Hopefully, this counteroffer will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $132 is a good compromise. It's a bit closer to my desired price than my minimum, and the deal is likely to close.  I'm happy to accept this offer."
