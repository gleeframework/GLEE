"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has incredible potential, and I'm confident it will bring you significant value. How about we meet halfway at $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the product's potential, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we discuss further?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I believe the product is worth more, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects my desire to reach a deal with you.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,175,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can we meet in the middle?",1175000.0,Bob,6,
