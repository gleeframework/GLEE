"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer. He has a higher maximum price he's willing to pay ($1,200,000) and it's likely Alice would be willing to come down a bit from her initial price. There are still 9 rounds to negotiate, providing ample opportunity to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming for a significant price drop. While $950,000 is still a good profit for Alice, it's a considerable reduction from her initial price. This strategy aims to establish a strong negotiation stance and push Alice towards a more favorable deal for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price. Even though Bob's initial counteroffer was rejected, it shows Alice is willing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer again allows for further negotiation and potentially a better deal.  There are still many rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from Round 2. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price lower than Alice's current offer.  The goal is to find a middle ground and get a better price than $1,150,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now equal to the price Jhon is offering.  There is no longer any advantage to continuing to negotiate with Alice.  Bob should accept Jhon's offer as it is a fair price and avoids further negotiation."
