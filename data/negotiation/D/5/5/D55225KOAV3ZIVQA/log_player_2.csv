"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay a maximum of $12,000 for the product. Alice is offering the product for $12,000.  This means you can get the product for the same price from John. Since there's no benefit to buying from Alice, rejecting the offer makes sense."
