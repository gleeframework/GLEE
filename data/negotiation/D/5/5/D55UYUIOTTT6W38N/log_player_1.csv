Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** We need to offer a price lower than Bob's valuation but high enough to maximize our profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Backup Plan:** We have John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, ensuring we won't go below our minimum. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still guaranteeing a profitable sale."
