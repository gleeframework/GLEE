Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  Since Bob values the product at $10,000,  $11,000 is a reasonable price to start the negotiation. This price also keeps me in a good position to accept a counteroffer if Bob makes one, while still giving me a profit.  I am prepared to accept a lower offer if needed, but I will not go below $12,000, as that is my minimum acceptable price."
