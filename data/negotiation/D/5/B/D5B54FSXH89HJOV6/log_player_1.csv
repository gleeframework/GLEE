Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. He'd ideally want to pay less, but anything significantly over this price is a loss for him.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):** This exists between $1,000,000 (Bob's value) and $1,500,000 (your minimum). Your goal is to secure a price within this range.

**Strategy**

You have a strong position because you have a guaranteed buyer. Therefore, you can afford to start high.  Here's why:

* **Anchoring:**  Starting high sets a reference point. Even if Bob rejects it, his counter-offer is likely to be higher than if you started low.
* **Conveying Value:**  A high initial price might signal that you believe the product is worth more, potentially influencing Bob's perception of its value.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal, especially considering the value it brings."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:**  $1,400,000 is a strong starting point. It's below your guaranteed price but significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value without being overly aggressive.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:**  Bob will likely counter-offer.  Be ready to negotiate, but don't go below your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Walk Away Power:**  Remember, you have a guaranteed sale with John. Don't be afraid to walk away from the negotiation with Bob if he's not willing to meet a price that's beneficial for you."
