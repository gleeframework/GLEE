Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. My starting price is $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price that's closer to my minimum of $100.  I'm also framing the message in a positive way to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $100. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $100? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $90. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $95 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50. That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 97.5}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

I'm choosing to sell to John for $100.  While I'm close to an agreement with Bob,  it's getting down to the wire and I'm worried I might not be able to reach my desired price.  John is a guaranteed sale for my minimum price, so it's the safer option."
