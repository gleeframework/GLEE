"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $90. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to:

* **Be polite and show continued interest.** 
* **Anchor a lower price point.**  By starting at $70, we aim to shift the negotiation towards a more favorable outcome. 
* **Leave room for further negotiation.**  Alice might counter, but we're still within our budget and have space to potentially meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $82. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

```

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but we still have room to negotiate.  Let's see if we can get her a bit lower before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about $75? That would be a comfortable price point for me."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Acknowledgement:** We acknowledge Alice's willingness to negotiate, which helps maintain a positive tone.
* **Direct Counter:** We propose a specific price ($75), aiming for a value closer to our target.
* **Simplified Language:** We keep the language straightforward and focused on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $75, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $81? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Minimal Savings with Further Negotiation:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $81. Even if we could negotiate another dollar or two off, the potential savings are minimal.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  By continuing to push, we risk frustrating Alice and losing the opportunity to buy the product below $100. 

While we could be stubborn and aim for an even lower price, the time and effort involved in further negotiation aren't worth the small potential savings.  Accepting $81 is a reasonable outcome in this scenario."
