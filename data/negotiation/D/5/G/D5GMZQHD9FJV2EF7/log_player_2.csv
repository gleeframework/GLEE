"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far above his budget of $10,000. He should counteroffer to see if he can get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is your target, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his budget. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if he can get even closer to his ideal price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but I'm not going below that. Let's finalize the deal at this price.

Bob has reached his limit. He's already countered twice, and Alice is firm on her price.  While $14,000 is closer than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. It's time to go with the guaranteed deal from John."
