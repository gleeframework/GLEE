Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120.  It's a great deal for something worth so much to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes the ""great deal"" for Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to engage in conversation.

This strategy balances the need to earn a good price with the possibility of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's a good chance Bob might be willing to pay more, especially if I make a counteroffer. 
* **John is a safety net:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $150 offer from John gives me the leverage to push for a better deal with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and have a chance to earn a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, showing willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing value for Bob:** I remind Bob that $105 is still a ""great deal"" for him.
* **Focus on fairness:** The message emphasizes the ""fair profit"" for me, which can make my counteroffer seem more reasonable. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us, increasing the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $85 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and even below Bob's initial perceived value of $80.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result. 
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's current offer.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take time and effort, potentially leading to a further reduction in price or a failed deal.  John provides a guaranteed sale with no risk.

By selling to John, I maximize my profit and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob."
