"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $10,250? It's still a great price for the product, and it would be a win-win for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down.  I'm willing to increase my offer a bit, how about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $10,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,000,  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
