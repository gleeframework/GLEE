Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.

We're still significantly above John's offer, and there's room to negotiate. Let's see if we can push Bob a little further."

It's time to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Profitable Price:** $1,275,000 is a significant profit margin above our $1,000,000 minimum. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  We're likely reaching a point of diminishing returns in the negotiation. Bob is unlikely to drastically increase his offer.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing the negotiation takes time, and we have a guaranteed offer from John. 

Accepting now secures a strong profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
