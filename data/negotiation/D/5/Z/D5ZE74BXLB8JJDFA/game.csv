"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. Could you consider something closer to $18,000? I'm willing to negotiate to make this work for both of us.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $18,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
