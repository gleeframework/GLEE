"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know Bob values the product at. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, hoping to make him see the potential for profit.
* **Room to Negotiate:**  $1,750,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, giving me flexibility in the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that's more realistic.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, as I believe there's still a chance to reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting his offer keeps me in a position of power, allowing me to counteroffer and potentially drive the price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,325,000?  This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm counter-offering with a price that's a compromise, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Finding a Solution:**  I'm framing the negotiation as a collaborative effort to find a solution that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  However, $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000.  This demonstrates my serious interest in the product, and I believe it's a fair price.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate, especially considering Bob's stated interest in the product. 
* **Maintain Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my target. I want to see if I can push Bob further before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is still too far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000 as a final offer.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Think about the value this product can bring to your business, and consider this offer carefully."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm emphasizing this as my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to incentivize him to make a more substantial offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I need to see a bit more movement. Would you consider $1,050,000? This is a substantial investment for me, and I need to ensure it aligns with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is inching closer, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Continues:**  I believe there is still room for Bob to increase his offer.  
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I can counteroffer and attempt to secure a more favorable price. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I want to explore all negotiation options with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000 as a final compromise.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I truly believe this product will generate much more revenue for your business.  I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unrealistic Expectations:** It seems Bob is unwilling to come up to a price that is reasonable for me. 
* **Secure a Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and a significant profit.  I'm no longer willing to risk further negotiation with Bob, who seems unlikely to meet my expectations."
