"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs and I'm happy to offer it to you for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have to make a profit, but $13,000 is still too much for me.  I can offer $9,500, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me.  Let's meet in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, I need to be closer to $12,000 for this to make sense for me. How about we split the difference between your offer and my last one -  $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit here, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me.  I can offer $10,000.  Let's try to finalize this deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
