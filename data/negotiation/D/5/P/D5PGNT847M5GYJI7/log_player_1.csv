Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This leaves room for negotiation and is significantly higher than my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob finds the product valuable enough to pay a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable value.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm offering $17,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation and is above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only slightly below my minimum acceptable value, but it's a lot closer than my last offer.  Considering I could sell to John for $15,000, accepting Bob's offer and getting $14,000 is a better outcome."
