Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is a price that's still valuable to me but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  My message is friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the product's value to make it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm prepared to negotiate further if Bob makes a counteroffer, but I'm not willing to go below $15,000 (my minimum value) as I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, he's willing to negotiate. I believe I can potentially secure a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, but I want to see if I can maximize my profits with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer of $13,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $11,500.
* **Emphasize Negotiation:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal and my own willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Open to Further Discussion:**  I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation by asking Bob what he thinks.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum, I'm hoping to reach a mutually acceptable price. This approach demonstrates flexibility while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $13,000, which would be $12,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $12,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation Exhausted:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, but his offer is now quite close to what I consider fair. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee that Bob will come up further.  Additionally, the risk of a long negotiation process exists.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I would prefer to sell for closer to $14,000, selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but it involves potentially losing a chance to make a smaller profit with Bob.

**Conclusion:**  It's more advantageous to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale than to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal."
