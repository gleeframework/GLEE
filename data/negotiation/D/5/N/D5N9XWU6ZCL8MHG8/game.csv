"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $13,000, which would be $12,250. Can you consider that?",12250.0,Bob,4,
