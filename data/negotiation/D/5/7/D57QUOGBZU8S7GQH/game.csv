"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
