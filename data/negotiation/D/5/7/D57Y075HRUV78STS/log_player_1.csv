"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $135. It's a bit higher than my minimum, but I believe Bob will be willing to negotiate down from there.  If he doesn't, I can always switch to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $125 is better than selling to John, I think I can get closer to my original asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price to $130. This is still a good price for me, and it shows I'm willing to compromise. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the same as the previous round, so I'll accept it. While I was hoping for a bit more, $125 is a good price and I'm not sure I'll get a better deal from Bob. I'm also concerned about running out of time and being forced to sell to John for less."
