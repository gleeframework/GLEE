"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, how about $9,250? This still leaves you with a good deal, and it's a price I can work with. Let me know your thoughts.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I think I can do $9,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,4,
