"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,000, considering the benefits it will bring to your work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, it's still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its potential value, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to offer you $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the value this product brings is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the long-term benefits you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  While $13,000 is closer to his target, he can likely still negotiate a better deal.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving towards a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $13,000.  How about we split the difference and settle at $12,500?  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
