"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,190,000. This is a significant price point for you, as it's just below its worth to you. It's also a fair deal for me, as it's very close to my minimum price.  If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,200,000.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000.
