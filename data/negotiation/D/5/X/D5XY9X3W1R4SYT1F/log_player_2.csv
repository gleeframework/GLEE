This is a good point to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're buying the product for $1,015,000, saving $185,000 compared to John's price.
* **Final Offer:** Alice has signaled this is her best price. Pushing further risks her walking away.
* **Limited Rounds:** You have only a few rounds left. While you might squeeze out a tiny bit more, the risk of Alice walking away isn't worth it at this point."
