# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is manipulative:** She's trying to inflate the product's value to you ($1,500,000) while knowing her own valuation is much lower ($1,200,000). 
* **You have a better alternative:** John offers the product for $1,500,000, which is your maximum limit. While this isn't ideal, it's better to establish a firm counter-offer with Alice first.
* **Negotiation power:** By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're not easily swayed and are willing to walk away. This might lead her to propose a more reasonable price closer to her own valuation."
