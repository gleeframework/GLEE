Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 (from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $300,000 difference to negotiate within.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but you also don't want to overshoot and make Bob reject the offer. Here's a balanced approach:

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Considering its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant opportunity for you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,400,000  is a strong starting point. It leaves you room to potentially negotiate down while still securing a significant profit.
* **Value-Based Language:**  Phrases like ""exceptional product"" and ""unique value"" subtly reinforce the product's worth.
* **Positive Framing:** Presenting it as ""a significant opportunity"" for Bob focuses on the benefit to him.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (around $1,350,000) to give more negotiation room.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a slightly less aggressive offer might be preferable.

**Remember:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
