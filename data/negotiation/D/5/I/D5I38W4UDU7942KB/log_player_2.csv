"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Considering its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant opportunity for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($1,200,000).  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can negotiate with Alice further or go with John, but only if John's price goes down.  There's always the potential that Alice will lower her price to secure the sale, which would be in Bob's favor."
