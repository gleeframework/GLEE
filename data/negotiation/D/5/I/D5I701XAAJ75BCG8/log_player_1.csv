Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this unique product.  While I recognize its potential value, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'd be willing to offer you $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.
