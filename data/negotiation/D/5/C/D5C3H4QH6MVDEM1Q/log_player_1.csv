Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a moderate offer. Here it is:

{""product_price"": 14,000}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is a bit lower than my initial offer, but still a decent price. I'll consider my options:

* Accepting Bob's offer would mean selling the product for $12,500, which is $1,500 less than my initial offer. I'd rather not lose that much, but I also don't want to risk losing the sale.
* Rejecting Bob's offer and sending a counteroffer would give me a chance to negotiate further, but I'm not sure if Bob would be willing to go higher.
* Selling the product to John for $12,000 is an option, but it's a bit lower than my initial offer, and I'd rather get a better price.

For now, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, hoping to get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still a bit lower than my initial offer. Here it is:

{""product_price"": 13,000}

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle or come close to it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is back to the original price I was willing to sell the product for. I've already considered selling it to John for this price, and I'm not sure if I want to risk losing the sale by trying to negotiate further.

Since Bob's offer is now at the minimum price I was willing to accept, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll sell the product to Bob for $12,000."
