"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $16,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing it's above Bob's perceived value.  This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to come down a bit if necessary.  I also want to emphasize the value of the product to me, hoping to make him feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $14,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold of $15,000, so I can't accept it. I'll continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is just a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This gives you a good deal, and I can still make a profit."", ""product_price"": 15500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $14,500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further lowering the price and ultimately getting less than what John is offering is too high.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing."
