Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it. I believe this is a fair starting point given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I'm motivated to find an agreement, but $12,000 is still quite a ways off from what I need to make this work.  Let's try $16,000. This feels like a fair compromise where we both benefit."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  Given the value to me, I can offer $14,000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can close the deal this round. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has significantly increased his offer and is now at $14,000. While it's tempting to hold out for a price closer to $15,000, there's a risk that Bob will walk away if we push further. Accepting $14,000 secures a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
