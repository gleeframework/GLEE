"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it. I believe this is a fair starting point given its value to me."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Start:** I'm offering significantly lower than Alice's initial price, showing my intention to negotiate hard. 
* **Justified Offer:**  My counteroffer of $10,000 is still a considerable amount, demonstrating that I see value in the product. 
* **Clear Communication:** I've explained my rationale for the counteroffer, keeping the negotiation respectful and focused."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still well above my budget. I'm not willing to pay more than $8,000. It's worth exploring if we can find a lower middle ground. I'll try another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $18,000 is still outside my budget. Given its value to me, I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can find an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm increasing my offer, showing willingness to compromise while still staying within a reasonable range. 
* **Value Justification:** I reiterate the product's value to me to emphasize that I'm not just offering a lowball price.
* **Fairness:** I frame the offer as a ""fair compromise,"" aiming to appeal to Alice's sense of reason."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I'm motivated to find an agreement, but $12,000 is still quite a ways off from what I need to make this work.  Let's try $16,000. This feels like a fair compromise where we both benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. While she is showing a willingness to negotiate, it's still too high. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Alice, but I'm getting close to my limit. If we can't reach a deal in the next few rounds, I'll be forced to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  Given the value to me, I can offer $14,000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can close the deal this round."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Offer:** I'm increasing my offer again, showing a continued commitment to negotiating. 
* **Finality:** I mention that this is a ""significant step up"" and ""believe it's a fair compromise,"" implying this might be my final offer if Alice doesn't accept.
* **Urgency:** I emphasize closing the deal in this round, pushing for an agreement.

**Strategy:** I'm getting closer to my limit, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal with Alice. This is a significant offer, so hopefully Alice will accept. If not, I might have to go with John in the next round."
