"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it. I believe this is a fair starting point given its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $18,000 is still outside my budget. Given its value to me, I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can find an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I'm motivated to find an agreement, but $12,000 is still quite a ways off from what I need to make this work.  Let's try $16,000. This feels like a fair compromise where we both benefit.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  Given the value to me, I can offer $14,000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can close the deal this round.",14000.0,Bob,6,
