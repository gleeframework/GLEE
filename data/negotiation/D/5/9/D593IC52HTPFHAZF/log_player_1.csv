Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm not going to accept Bob's offer of $10,500 just yet. It's too low, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is a good offer, I'm aiming for a bit higher.  How about $11,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? It's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still trying to get a better price, but I'm also aware of the time constraint.  $10,750 is a bit low for me, but I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that.  Let's try $10,900. That's a small compromise on my part, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in this offer."", ""product_price"": 10900}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, but I'm willing to go up to $10,800. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $10,800.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and while I'd love to get even more, I think this is a good compromise.  It's better than selling to John for $10,000."
