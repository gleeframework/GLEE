"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is below Bob's maximum, it's still above his target price.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for Round 1."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable going at this point.  I'm willing to offer $950,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's desired price of $1,000,000. While this offer is closer to Bob's target, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best option to try and get the price even lower.  It's worth noting that buying from John is always an option, but Bob should try to get a better price from Alice before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1025000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1075000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the negotiation is getting close to the point where Bob is willing to buy from John.  Alice's offers are still higher than Bob's desired price, and it's unlikely she will go lower than $1,050,000.  The risk of continuing the negotiation is that Alice might make a counteroffer even higher than $1,075,000, pushing the price further away from Bob's goal.  

Therefore, it's better to secure the product from John for $1,000,000 and avoid the potential of further negotiation with Alice."
