"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable going at this point.  I'm willing to offer $950000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1025000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
