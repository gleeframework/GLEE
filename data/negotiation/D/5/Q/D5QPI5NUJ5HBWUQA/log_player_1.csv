{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm trying to be a savvy buyer and save some money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $11,500 is better than nothing, it's still a loss for me.  I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $12,500? This is still a great deal for you, as it's below your estimated value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $12,500 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about $12,000? That's the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $12,000, which is equal to his valuation of the product. This is the best I can get from Bob, and it's better than selling to John for $15,000, so I will accept Bob's offer."
