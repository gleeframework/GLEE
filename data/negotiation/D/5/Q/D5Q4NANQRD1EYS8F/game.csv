"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,100,000 is a tempting figure, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and bring my offer down to $1,125,000. This is a very competitive price considering the potential benefits you'll reap. ",1125000.0,Alice,3,
