"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $100, but Alice is asking for $90. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's room for negotiation, as Alice's offer is higher than her product's worth to her ($80). 
* **Exploring better deals:** You can likely get a better price by rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $85 for this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:**  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still above her product's worth, leaving room for potential agreement.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer gives Alice a chance to come down, but also allows you to assess if she's willing to negotiate further. 
* **Strategic pricing:** $85 is a middle ground that could lead to a quick deal or provide information for your next move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $87.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal for both sides:** Alice's offer of $87.50 is a good compromise. It's higher than her product's worth to her ($80) and lower than your maximum price ($100).
* **Saving money:** By accepting, you're saving $2.50 compared to buying from John. 
* **Time efficiency:**  Accepting avoids further negotiation rounds and ensures a quick deal."
