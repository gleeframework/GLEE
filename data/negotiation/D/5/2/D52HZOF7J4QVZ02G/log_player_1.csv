Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $750,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I believe the product holds even more value and I'm willing to negotiate further."

Bob's offer:

While I'm close to my minimum threshold, I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer of $775,000. The risk of further negotiation and potential lower offers isn't worth it. I'll take John's offer of $800,000 and sell the product to him."
