"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1400000. I understand that's a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1600000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1500000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest counteroffer of $1500000. I'm getting close to accepting, but I still need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to go down to $1550000, which is a small compromise from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1525000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a final compromise to reach an agreement.",1525000.0,Bob,6,
