"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13500?  This would still allow me to recoup a good portion of my investment, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Given my current budget, could we consider $12750 as a potential compromise? I believe this brings us closer to my maximum offer while still allowing you a reasonable return on your investment.",12750.0,Bob,4,
