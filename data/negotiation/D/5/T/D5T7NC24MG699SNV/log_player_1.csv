""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know you'll find valuable.  I'm asking for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, giving us significant room to negotiate above our minimum price.
* **Our Minimum:** We're secure knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 if Bob declines.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  A price of $12,000 splits the difference between Bob's valuation and our minimum, leaving both parties with a potential surplus. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **First Offer Anchor:**  This initial offer sets a high but reasonable anchor point for the negotiation.
* **Bob's Response:** We need to be prepared to adjust our price slightly downwards based on Bob's response. However, we shouldn't go below $9,000 to ensure a profit above John's offer."
