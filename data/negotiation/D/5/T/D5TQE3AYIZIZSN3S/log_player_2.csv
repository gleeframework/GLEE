"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer that considers both of our positions.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect your approach to negotiation.  While $1,050,000 is closer to the mark, I can't accept that price.  I'm willing to make a significant move to $1,250,000. This offer stands as a testament to my willingness to find a solution, but it's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is clearly holding firm around the $1.25 million mark. While she might budge a little, it's unlikely she'll come down to a price that beats John's offer. It's time to cut my losses and secure the product for the guaranteed price from John."
