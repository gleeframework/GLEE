"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You have no information about the product's value to Alice. You know your maximum price is $1,200,000, and John is willing to sell it for that price.  

Since Alice's offer is at your maximum, there's no incentive to accept. Rejecting the offer leaves you with the option to purchase from John at the same price, which provides you with more information about the product's value before committing."
