"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a price that I think is a great value for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is lower than your maximum price of $12,000, meaning you'll save $1,000 compared to buying from John. While you might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, it's not guaranteed, and the risk of losing the deal is higher. It's better to accept her offer and save money."
