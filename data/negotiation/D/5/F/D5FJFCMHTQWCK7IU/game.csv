"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $15000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to consider $8000, which is the price I'm willing to pay for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell the product for. Is this a deal you'd be willing to accept?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $11000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. Is this a deal you'd be willing to accept?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, and that's $10500. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're interested, this is your last chance to make a deal. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a serious offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $10500. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're still willing to go as low as $9000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm going to make one last offer, and that's $10000. This is my final offer, and if you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid I've reached my limit, Alice. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider other options, including buying the product from John for $8000.",9000.0,Bob,10,
