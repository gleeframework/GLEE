"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount to you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you and my original asking price.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $875,000 is still a little more than I'm able to spend right now. I'm willing to offer $825,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the fair value of the product to me. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually agreeable price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $835,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I truly believe it represents a fair value for the product considering my needs and its worth to me. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",835000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price again. However, $845,000 is still slightly more than I'm prepared to spend. I'm willing to offer a final price of $840,000. This is a substantial compromise from my previous offer, and I sincerely believe it reflects the fair value of the product for both of us. I'm hoping we can close this deal now.",840000.0,Bob,8,
