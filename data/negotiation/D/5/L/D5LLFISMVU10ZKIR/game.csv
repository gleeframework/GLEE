"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? ",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I understand that $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $95?,95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm open to negotiating further, but $95 is still a little too low. Let's meet in the middle at $100.  That would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
