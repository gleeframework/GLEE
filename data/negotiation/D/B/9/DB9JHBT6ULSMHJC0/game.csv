"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to feel confident that we're on the same page.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $850000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
