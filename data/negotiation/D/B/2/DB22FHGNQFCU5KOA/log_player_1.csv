"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum of $120 and gives Bob some room to negotiate.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $130 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm countering with $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would have preferred to get $140, $135 is a good price and it's getting close to the end of our rounds.  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by being too stubborn."
