Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree this product has value, your initial asking price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer you $6,000 for the product. "",

}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,250. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value at this price.

While Alice is moving closer to her perceived value, the price is still significantly higher than her $8,000 valuation. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if I can get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $8,250 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to increase my offer to $7,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product."",

# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to be flexible and make another concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $8,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal.
