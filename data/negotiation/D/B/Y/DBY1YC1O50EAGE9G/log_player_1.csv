Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product that's worth a lot more to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000** is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in a conversation.

**Strategy:**

By starting at $10,000, I am hoping to quickly gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. If he rejects, I can lower the price slightly in subsequent counteroffers, but I won't go below $12,000, as that's my minimum acceptable price.  The key is to keep the negotiation moving while staying above my minimum. If Bob becomes too difficult or the negotiation stalls, I can always switch to selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial $8,000 valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I need to keep negotiating to try and get closer to my target. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $10,000. I'll try to meet him halfway by offering $9,250. This shows him that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give him the product for a huge discount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a bit lower than what I can do right now. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. It's a fair price considering the value of this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $9,250, which is a midpoint between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

By offering $9,250, I'm aiming to:

* **Maintain a price above my minimum:** This ensures I don't undervalue the product.
* **Signal willingness to negotiate:**  This shows Bob I'm flexible but not desperate to sell.
* **Encourage a quick decision:** By meeting him halfway, I hope to avoid lengthy negotiations. 

If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I might consider lowering the price a bit more, but I'll be cautious about going too low.  I'll also be prepared to switch to selling to John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you meet me at $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly below my target.  Selling to John for $12,000 would be a much better outcome, and I'm willing to take that chance rather than settle for a price that undervalues my product. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my $9,250 counteroffer.  I will offer $9,000, hoping to find a compromise that is fair for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're still hesitant, but $8,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's getting closer to what we need to make this work.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $9,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $9,250 and Bob's offer of $8,750. This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Message:**  I'm reiterating that I'm willing to negotiate but maintaining a firm stance on my minimum acceptable price. I'm also emphasizing the need to find a mutually beneficial solution to encourage a quick agreement.

**Strategy:**

By offering $9,000, I'm aiming to:

* **Stay above my minimum:** This ensures I don't undervalue the product.
* **Signal willingness to negotiate:** This shows Bob I'm flexible, but I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Encourage a quick decision:** By meeting him halfway again, I hope to avoid further rounds of negotiation.

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I will seriously consider selling to John for $12,000.  While I'd prefer to get a slightly higher price from Bob, I won't waste too much time if it seems like he's not willing to meet me halfway."
