"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a bit lower than what I can do right now. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. It's a fair price considering the value of this product.  What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still hesitant, but $8,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's getting closer to what we need to make this work.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,5,
