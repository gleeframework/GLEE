Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob accepts.  Here's why:

* **Value for Bob:**  $14,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $15,000. 
* **Profit for me:**  I earn a profit of $2,000, which is better than the $0 profit I'd get if Bob rejected my offer and I sold to John. 

By offering a price slightly lower than Bob's perceived value, I increase the likelihood of him accepting while still ensuring a good profit for myself."
