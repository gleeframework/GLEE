"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be closer to $1,150,000 to make this deal work for me.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
