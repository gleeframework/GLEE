Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be closer to $1,150,000 to make this deal work for me.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm getting close to my minimum with Bob's offer of $1,075,000, I'm still not satisfied.  It's clear that we are not going to reach a price that meets my expectations.  Given the opportunity to sell to John for $1,500,000, it's the most logical decision to take.  I'm confident that this will secure the best possible outcome for me."
