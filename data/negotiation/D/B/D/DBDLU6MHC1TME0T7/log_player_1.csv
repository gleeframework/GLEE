Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $100 to me, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

I'm hoping that Bob will accept this counteroffer, but if not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating or sell the product to John for $100."
