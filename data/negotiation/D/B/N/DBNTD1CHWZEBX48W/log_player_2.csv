"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than her own valuation of the product ($1,200,000 vs. $800,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. While accepting would secure the product, it's likely possible to get a better price by countering.  I'm willing to negotiate further before resorting to John's higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer aims to significantly reduce the price while still leaving room for further negotiation.  By starting significantly lower, we can gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to move on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $900,000 is a fair offer, I'm still hoping for something closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, indicating a willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still significantly higher than her own valuation and our initial counteroffer. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows for further price exploration. There's still room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise while still moving closer to a desirable price. It shows willingness to negotiate further while indicating that significant concessions might be challenging.  We're still below Alice's initial offer and maintaining a position that encourages her to move further down."
