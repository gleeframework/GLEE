"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider it. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you consider $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $125. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $115?  That's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a compromise. I'm willing to make another adjustment, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to offer you the product for $130. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think it's a good compromise.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $120.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",120.0,Bob,6,
