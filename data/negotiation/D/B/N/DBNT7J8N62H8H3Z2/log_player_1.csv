Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $200. I believe it provides excellent value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:**  Providing a vague reason like ""excellent value"" might pique Bob's curiosity without revealing your bottom line. 

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remember that I (Alice) have the backup option of John, who will buy the product for $150. Any offer significantly lower than this would be unwise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than both my minimum acceptable price ($150) and my initial offer. There's room for negotiation, and I'm better off trying to meet somewhere in the middle before accepting such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $100 is quite low for what I'm offering. How about we meet in the middle at $170?"", 
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've significantly lowered my asking price from $200 to $170, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price is still significantly above my minimum ($150) and Bob's offer ($100), leaving space for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Clear Justification:** I've provided a clear reason for my counteroffer (""meet in the middle""), making it seem fair and reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $170 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $120. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob has stated that $120 is his final offer. This means further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better outcome.
* **Below Minimum:** Even though Bob increased his offer, $120 is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John provides a guaranteed sale at my desired minimum price. 

It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiation with Bob, especially since he's presented his ""final offer."" Accepting John's offer ensures I make a profit and avoids a potentially drawn-out negotiation."
