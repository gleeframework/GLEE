Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

This offer is strategic because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:**  $11,500 is more than your $10,000 reserve price, ensuring you profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's maximum value:**  Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so $11,500 still leaves him with a potential gain. 
* **It incentivizes Bob to accept:**  This offer gives Bob a decent discount on the product while still allowing you to earn a good profit.

By offering this price, you increase the likelihood of Bob accepting, but also ensure that if he rejects, you still have a secure sale to John."
