Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This gives me some room to negotiate, and it's above the minimum value I'm willing to accept.  I'm also aware that Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's a chance he'll be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm going to counteroffer with $11,000.  This is still a good profit for me, and I hope it's enough to entice Bob to close the deal without risking losing him completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $10,500. I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I still want to see if Bob is willing to go a little higher.  If he rejects this, I might have to consider selling to John."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but I'm running out of time and I'm not sure I can get him to go any higher. John is a guaranteed sale at a price that's close enough to what I want."
