"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, $18,000, to see if Bob is truly interested.  This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a good profit for me. However, I am willing to accept John's offer of $12,000 at any time if Bob is unwilling to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm dropping the price slightly to $17,000.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still keeps the price above my minimum.  Hopefully, Bob sees this as a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, $16,000 is a good deal considering we're already in the fourth round and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
