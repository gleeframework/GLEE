"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000. ",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'll offer you the product for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to compromise any further.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll meet you halfway between $850,000 and $750,000. I'll offer the product to you for $800,000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.
