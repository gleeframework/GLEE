"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives Bob a good starting point, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price if needed, but it's important to start strong."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $75 is below my minimum. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm countering with $90. This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum. I believe it's a fair price, and hopefully, Bob will see the value in accepting."
