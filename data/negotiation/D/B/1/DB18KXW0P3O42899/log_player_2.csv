"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:** Even though Alice's offer is higher than her value of the product ($800,000), it's still lower than what Bob would pay John ($1,000,000). 
* **Saving money is the goal:**  Bob aims to save as much money as possible. Accepting Alice's offer saves him $50,000 compared to buying from John."
