,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $92.50. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal!",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous discussion, so I'll offer $91. Would you be willing to accept that price?",91.0,Bob,4,
