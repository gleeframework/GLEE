Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below your minimum acceptable price ($120) creates a sense of urgency and perceived value for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is close to your minimum, there's a slight chance Bob might negotiate up, netting you even more profit.

This strategy aims to balance maximizing potential profit from Bob while still ensuring a sale at your desired price point."
