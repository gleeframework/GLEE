Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than your minimum, giving you some room to negotiate, but it's still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $100 is below my minimum price. I'll counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $115?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $115. How about $110? I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $110 is close to my minimum and still a good deal for me.  There's a chance Bob might not be willing to go higher, so I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
