"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially save more by rejecting the offer and counter-offering. There's room for negotiation, and Bob has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to my maximum budget. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise, and still a good profit for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,050,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This reflects the value of the product to you and gives you a fair price. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,075,000 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again allows Bob to potentially secure a price closer to $1,000,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,062,500. This would still give you a good profit, and we can finally seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 1062500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $1,062,500 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, at $1,068,750. This is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,068,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,068,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,068,750 is the closest she has come to Bob's budget.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice will become too stubborn and refuse to lower her price further.  At this point, it's more beneficial to secure the deal with Alice and save a significant amount compared to buying from John."
