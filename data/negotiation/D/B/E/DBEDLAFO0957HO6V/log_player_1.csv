``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** This ensures you don't lose out on a substantial profit.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This allows Bob to understand the offer easily. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and securing a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to my maximum budget. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise, and still a good profit for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's above his maximum budget, it's still below your desired profit margin. It's important to maintain your leverage in this negotiation and push for a more favorable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,050,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This reflects the value of the product to you and gives you a fair price. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you're willing to negotiate, but not at a drastic loss to yourself.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,062,500. This would still give you a good profit, and we can finally seal the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  There is a significant gap between your desired profit and Bob's offer.  By rejecting this offer, you are maintaining your leverage and signaling to Bob that you're still seeking a more favorable price. This also opens the door to potentially counteroffer again and get closer to your goal."
