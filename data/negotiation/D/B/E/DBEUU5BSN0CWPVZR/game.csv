"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000. I understand the product is worth more to you, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  Would you be willing to consider $850,000?  This would still represent a significant profit for you and would allow me to purchase the product within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm still looking to maximize my profit. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still trying to stay closer to $800,000, but I'm willing to go a bit higher. How about $875,000? This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. After re-evaluating, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise that reflects the product's value to both of us.
