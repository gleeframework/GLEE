{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer sets a high starting point, but it's still within Bob's range of value.  This allows for negotiation and potential for a higher price, while also setting the stage for a firm stance if Bob tries to lowball me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to be reasonable about the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to accept $800,000, it's not worth it. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price.  I can still get a better price from Bob, or I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a great value for you. This price reflects the true worth of the product, and it's an investment that will surely pay off. Let's find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. It's a gamble to keep negotiating with Bob, and I'm not convinced I can get him to budge further. Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation."
