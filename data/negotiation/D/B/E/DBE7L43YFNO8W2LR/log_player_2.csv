{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price.  You're still within your budget with John, so you have room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm starting with a strong counteroffer, close to my maximum price point.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but also that I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get it closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}

I'm going to offer a price that's just below my maximum.  It's a good compromise and shows I'm serious about buying, but I'm not willing to go any lower."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is now within my budget and a good compromise.  It's worth accepting the deal rather than risking further negotiation and potentially having to buy from John."
