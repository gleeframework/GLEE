"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1200000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm eager to make a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This price still reflects the value of the product to me, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still out of my range. I'm ready to finalize a deal at $900000, which is a significant amount for me and shows my serious interest in acquiring this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $900000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
