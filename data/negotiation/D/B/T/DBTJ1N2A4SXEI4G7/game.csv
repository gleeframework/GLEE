"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $1,050,000? I think this is a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
