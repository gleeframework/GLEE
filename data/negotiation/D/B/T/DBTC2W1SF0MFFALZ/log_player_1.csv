I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000.  This is a price that is higher than my minimum value of $12,000, giving me a profit if he accepts.  It's also a price that might be attractive to Bob if he values the product highly.  If he rejects, I can still sell to John for $12,000, ensuring I don't lose money."
