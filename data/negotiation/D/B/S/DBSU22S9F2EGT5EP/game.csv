,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. Would you be willing to consider $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $12,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,000.  Would that be workable?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession - would you be willing to meet me at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,5,
