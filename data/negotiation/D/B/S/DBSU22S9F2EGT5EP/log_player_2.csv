Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. Would you be willing to consider $12,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession - would you be willing to meet me at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $12,000. While she might budge a little, it's not worth the risk of her digging in her heels and the negotiation stalling.  It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John for $10,000 and save the $3,500."
