Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

 I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to accept $9,500.  This gives you a great deal, and it's fair to me. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,200 is getting closer to my goal, I still have a few rounds left and I believe I can get a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to drop any lower than $9,400. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. It's a win-win situation! Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9400}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $9,100, I'm still hopeful that I can get a better price. I only have a few rounds left, so I need to be strategic."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my final offer. If you can meet me at this price, I'll take the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

This is a tough one!  I've reached the point where I only have two rounds left and Bob isn't budging much.  While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk losing out completely. It's time to take the safe option and sell to John."
