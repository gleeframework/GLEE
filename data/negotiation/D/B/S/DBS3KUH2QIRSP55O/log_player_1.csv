"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate down and creates the impression the product might be worth more than Bob initially thought.
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer is more about gauging Bob's interest and starting the negotiation, rather than expecting immediate acceptance. His response will give me information to use in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal. I'm willing to counter-offer in the hopes of finding a price point between $12,000 and $18,000 that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. $18,000 might have been a little high, but $12,000 is lower than I can go. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate by coming down from my initial offer. 
* **Middle Ground:**  $15,000 is a significant drop from my starting price but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed, while being a good amount above both Bob's offer and my minimum.
* **Justifying the Price:**  I'm not just throwing out a number. I'll need to reinforce the value of the product to Bob in my message during future rounds if he rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but I believe there's still some wiggle room. Bob is clearly interested and is incrementally increasing his offer.  I'm willing to push a bit further to see if I can get closer to $14,000.  I'm not quite ready to walk away from a potentially higher profit than John's guaranteed offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're getting closer, Bob. This product offers a lot of value that you'll see a return on.  How about we settle on $14,250?"", 
""product_price"": 14250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Down Concessions:** I'm reducing the size of my counter-offers to signal I'm reaching my limit.
* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counter-offer aims to find a middle ground between his latest offer ($13,500) and my previous ask ($15,000). 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the value proposition to keep Bob focused on the long-term benefits of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, Alice, but $14,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob's offer is now only $1,000 less than my initial ask, and only $1,000 more than John's guaranteed offer. Further haggling is unlikely to yield a significantly better result, and I risk losing the sale entirely.
* **Time Value:** We've spent several rounds negotiating. Accepting now secures a reasonable profit and allows me to move on to other potential deals. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's always a chance Bob might walk away if I counter again. Accepting his current offer mitigates that risk."
