"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get an even lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to find a price that's a good deal for him, but also leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary. Offering $9,000 is a reasonable starting point, demonstrating that he's serious about buying the product but also that he's willing to push for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,500, which is a price that Bob is comfortable with. Buying the product for $9,500 is still a significant saving compared to John's offer of $12,000.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a lower price, so accepting this offer is the most sensible choice."
