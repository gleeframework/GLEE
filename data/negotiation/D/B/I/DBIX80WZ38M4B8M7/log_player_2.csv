# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential return on investment you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can still purchase the product from John for $1,500,000, staying within his budget."
