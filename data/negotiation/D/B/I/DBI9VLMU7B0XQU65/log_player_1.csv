"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob is interested but doesn't want to pay that much. It also shows that I value the product and am not afraid to ask for what I believe it's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $18,000 is a decent amount, I'm aiming for closer to my initial price. I have rounds left and believe I can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm going to counter with $19,000. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot and lead to a quick deal."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still have a few rounds left and feel like I can get a better price. I want to avoid selling to John for $15,000 if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18500}

I'm going to meet Bob halfway this time and counter with $18,500.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I'm hoping this shows a willingness to be flexible while still trying to secure a price closer to my initial value."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $17,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and we're running out of rounds.  I don't want to risk selling to John for $15,000 and think I can make a decent profit with this deal."
