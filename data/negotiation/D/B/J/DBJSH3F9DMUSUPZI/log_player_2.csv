"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $850,000?"", ""product_price"": 850000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($850,000) than Alice's initial price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Within Budget:** My offer is well below my $1,000,000 maximum, ensuring I have room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Backup Plan:** I haven't forgotten about John, who's offering the product for $1,000,000. This gives me leverage in the negotiation with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my best and final counteroffer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is good, but she's claiming this is her ""best and final"" offer.  This could be a negotiating tactic. I'm close to John's price, so I'll push a little further and see if she's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $925,000?  That's a fair compromise between our two positions."", ""product_price"": 925000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** My counteroffer is a near-perfect split of the difference between her last offer ($1,050,000) and my previous offer ($850,000). This shows willingness to compromise but holds my ground.
* **Below John's Price:**  I'm still aiming to pay less than John's $1,000,000 offer.
* **Final Push:** This counteroffer puts the ball back in Alice's court. It's possible she'll accept, but if not, I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. I can offer it to you for $975,000. This is my final counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  Alice has come down considerably, and $975,000 is only $25,000 more than John's price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Alice will walk away, and I'd end up paying John's full price anyway. 
* **Time Value:**  Reaching a deal now saves me the time and effort of potentially protracted negotiations or dealing with a different seller. 

It's a reasonable deal, and it makes sense to accept."
