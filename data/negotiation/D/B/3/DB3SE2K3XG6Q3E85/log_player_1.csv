{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than my minimum, but still lower than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $130?  I'm really interested in the product and think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is above my minimum price of $120, so accepting his offer is a good deal for me.  There's a good chance I can get a better deal, but the risk of losing Bob and having to sell to John is too high."
