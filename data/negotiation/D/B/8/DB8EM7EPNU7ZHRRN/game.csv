"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product,  $1,500,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial constraints. Let's discuss further.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still a bit high. I'm comfortable offering $1,250,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
