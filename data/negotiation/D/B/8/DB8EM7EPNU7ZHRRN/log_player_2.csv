"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. My starting price is $1,500,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product,  $1,500,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial constraints. Let's discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  We're starting with a lower counteroffer, reflecting a strong desire to save money. We're also acknowledging the product's potential to justify the price, but framing it within our budget. This builds a foundation for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above our budget. We can continue to negotiate and try to get closer to our target price of $1,200,000.  There are still rounds left, and we want to exhaust all negotiation options before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still a bit high. I'm comfortable offering $1,250,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:** We're continuing to negotiate incrementally. This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a price that's closer to our desired target. We're also focusing on a ""fair"" deal, trying to appeal to Alice's sense of reason and potential for a win-win scenario."
