Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product,  $1,500,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial constraints. Let's discuss further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
