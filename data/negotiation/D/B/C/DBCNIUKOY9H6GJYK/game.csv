"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the value you see in it, but my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $8500? I believe we could reach a fair agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that budget constraints can be a challenge. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
