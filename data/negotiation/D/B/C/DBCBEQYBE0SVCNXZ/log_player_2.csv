{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Your maximum price:** $10,000
* **Alice's offer:** $9,500
* **John's price:** $10,000

Since you can get the product from John for $10,000, rejecting Alice's offer is the best option as you can still get the product at your maximum price."
