"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high for Bob's budget.  It's crucial to start negotiating and push for a lower price. There's a significant gap between Alice's asking price and Bob's maximum budget, making it worthwhile to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly over my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $700,000. This is a fair starting point for negotiations and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:**  Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, showing Alice that he's serious about negotiating and willing to go lower than her initial ask. This sends a strong message.
* **Focus on Value:**  Bob reiterates his understanding of the product's value, implying he's not just throwing out a random number.  
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends with a ""fair starting point"" phrasing, indicating flexibility for further discussions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $925,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the inherent value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing willingness to negotiate,  $925,000 is still too high for Bob.  He's only willing to go up to $800,000.  Therefore, rejecting this offer and continuing negotiations is the best option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 remains outside my budget. Given our shared goal of reaching an agreement, I'm offering $850,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and is as high as I can go while remaining within my financial constraints. I'm confident this price reflects the product's value while being a fair starting point for us to finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob demonstrates his willingness to negotiate by increasing his offer, but only by a smaller amount. This shows he's serious but not desperate.
* **Focus on Value & Constraints:**  He emphasizes the price reflecting the product's value and highlights his financial limitations, making the offer more persuasive.
* **""Fair Starting Point"" Again:**  This phrase keeps the door open for further discussion without making the offer feel like a final ultimatum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the product's value. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to accept $887,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while acknowledging our negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, $887,500 is still slightly above his budget.  He can likely negotiate further and potentially secure the product for closer to his desired $800,000 mark.  It's worthwhile to continue negotiations and see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $887,500 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $825,000. This reflects a genuine effort to meet in the middle while remaining within my financial constraints.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal with a small adjustment on your end."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pushing the Limit:** Bob is making a counteroffer close to his maximum budget, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  
* **""Meeting in the Middle"" Focus:** This phrase reinforces the idea of both parties making compromises.
* **""Small Adjustment"" Tone:**  This avoids a hard-line approach and leaves the door open for Alice to slightly lower her price."
