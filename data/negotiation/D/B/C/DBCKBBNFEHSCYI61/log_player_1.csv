Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly over my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $700,000. This is a fair starting point for negotiations and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 remains outside my budget. Given our shared goal of reaching an agreement, I'm offering $850,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and is as high as I can go while remaining within my financial constraints. I'm confident this price reflects the product's value while being a fair starting point for us to finalize a deal.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $887,500 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $825,000. This reflects a genuine effort to meet in the middle while remaining within my financial constraints.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal with a small adjustment on your end. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offers are creeping up too slowly. It's unlikely he'll reach the $887,500 mark I proposed, let alone go higher.  Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees a reasonable profit without the risk of Bob's offers stalling out below my minimum."
