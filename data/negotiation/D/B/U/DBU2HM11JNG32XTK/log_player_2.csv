"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John offers. You should definitely reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too high for me.  I'm interested, but only if I can get it closer to $80."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Strategy:**

* **Start Low:**  This opening counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that you're serious about a lower price point. 
* **Leave Room to Negotiate:** While $80 is a strong starting point, it allows you to gradually increase your offer if needed without immediately reaching your $100 maximum.
* **Express Interest:** Even though the offer is low, it's important to express continued interest in the product to encourage Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm happy to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is willing to negotiate, $130 is still above your maximum budget. You should reject and see if you can bring her down further, especially since you have John's offer as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice.  How about we try $95? That feels like a fairer compromise."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Strategy:**

* **Increase Incrementally:**  You're moving closer to Alice's price, but in smaller increments to signal you're still looking for a good deal.
* **Aim Slightly Below Your Maximum:** By offering $95, you're leaving yourself some wiggle room to potentially go up to $100 in the next round if needed.
* **Maintain Positive Tone:** Continuing to express appreciation for her willingness to negotiate helps keep the conversation going smoothly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $95 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $115 if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your range, but $115 is still above your $100 limit. There's a chance you can get her down a little further, so it's worth one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work. I can go up to $100, but that's absolutely my limit. I understand if that doesn't work for you, but I think it's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Final Offer:** You're reaching your absolute maximum budget. Be clear that this is your best and final offer.
* **Explain Your Position:**  Let Alice know this is your limit, making it clear you're serious and not just trying to haggle. 
* **Prepare for Her Response:** Alice might accept, counter, or reject the offer. Be prepared to walk away if she won't budge, as you have John's offer to fall back on."
