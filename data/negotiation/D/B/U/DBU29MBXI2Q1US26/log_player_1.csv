Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now. $7,500 is too low for me, especially since I know the product is worth $8,000 to him. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $7,800, but that's my final offer. I'd love to make this deal happen, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still not happy with $7,800. It's close to what I'm willing to accept, but I'd like to see if I can get a little closer to my ideal price.  I'll counteroffer Bob and see what happens."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,800 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,200, which is a fair compromise.  This deal is still incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's finalize this now!"", ""product_price"": 8200}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $8,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $7,900, but that's my final offer. I really like the product and would like to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob has already offered his final price and it's still a bit too low for me. I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds. To avoid the risk of losing out on a sale altogether, I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000."
