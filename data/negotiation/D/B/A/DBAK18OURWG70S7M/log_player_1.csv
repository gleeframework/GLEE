Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject. This gives me room to negotiate while still achieving a decent profit.  I'm aiming to find a price point that's acceptable to both of us, but I'm also prepared to walk away if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's a significant improvement from his initial rejection, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,500,000. This is my minimum acceptable price. I believe this offer is fair, considering Bob's value for the product and my need to maximize profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. Even though I have the option to counteroffer, I'm choosing to sell to John. The risk of further negotiation with Bob might lead to a lower price, or even a stalemate. Selling to John guarantees me the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and provides a secure outcome."
