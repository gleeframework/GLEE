{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,500. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's high enough to give me a good profit, but low enough to be attractive to Bob since he values it at $15,000.  We'll see how the negotiation goes from there!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get a better price. I know the product is worth more to Bob, and I'm willing to continue negotiating with him.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to make a profit on this. How about $11,500? It's still a great deal for you, considering you value it at $15,000."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'll make one last attempt to reach an agreement. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $11,000 is still a decent profit, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate. It's important to be realistic and secure a good deal, even if it's not perfect."
