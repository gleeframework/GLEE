Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price.  I'll assess Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer.  I'm still hopeful to get a better price than $12,000 from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm dropping my price a bit to $13,000.  This is still above my minimum, but shows I'm willing to negotiate.  We'll see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum.  It's a better offer than I'd get from John, so I'm going to accept it and sell the product to Bob."
