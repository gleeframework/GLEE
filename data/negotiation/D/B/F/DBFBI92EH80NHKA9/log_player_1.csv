Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is still a significant profit for you, and it leaves room for us to find a middle ground. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
