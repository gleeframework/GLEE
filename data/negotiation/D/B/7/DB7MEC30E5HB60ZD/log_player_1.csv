Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. I believe it's worth significantly more than that, but I'm hoping to find a good home for it."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Starting with an offer closer to Bob's maximum valuation increases the chances of a quick sale at a high price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, still keeping you comfortably above your minimum.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate a lower price or reject it outright. However, this strategy gives you the best chance to maximize your profit."
