"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price just below what I know the product is worth to Bob, hoping to strike a good deal in the first round. I'm also being friendly and engaging to encourage a positive interaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $120, so I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price.  I still have 8 rounds left and can always sell to John for $120 if I can't reach a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $130? That still leaves some room for you to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $115 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable price point.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further. I have 6 rounds left and can still sell to John for $120 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $115 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $125? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for the product. That's the lowest price I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, and I'm happy to close the deal at $120. It's a fair price for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
