"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $130? That still leaves some room for you to get a good deal.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $115 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $115 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $125? That's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for the product. That's the lowest price I'm comfortable with.",120.0,Bob,6,
