Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming to get more than your minimum of $100.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is willing to pay $120, so there's space for him to counteroffer without making it seem unreasonable.
* **It's a good initial price point:**  It's not too aggressive, but it shows you're confident in the value of your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I can still aim for a higher price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $110. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 110}
