"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is better than $120, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $110. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny. Let's see if we can make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered the price to $110, which is still within Bob's budget of $120. While Bob would ideally want to pay less, it's likely that Alice won't go any lower. Accepting this offer saves Bob $10 compared to buying from John and secures the product."
