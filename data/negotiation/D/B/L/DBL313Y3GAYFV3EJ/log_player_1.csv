Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We know John acts as a safety net, guaranteeing Alice at least $1,200,000. Therefore, Alice should aim to get more than this from Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:**  Offering the product for $1,200,000 or more to Bob would likely lead to rejection, as it's equal to or more than his perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a price exceeding John's offer and avoiding a rejection that would necessitate accepting the guaranteed $1,200,000."
