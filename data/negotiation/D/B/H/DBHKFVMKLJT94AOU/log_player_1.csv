"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage him to engage.  We'll see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can offer you $95 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a little higher than that. How about $105? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 
I'm going to try to close the gap by offering a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. I'm also emphasizing fairness to encourage him to consider my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can offer you $100 for the product. This feels like a fair price considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally reached my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I could potentially continue negotiating and try to squeeze a little more out of him, there's a risk he might walk away, and I'd be stuck selling to John for the same price.  It's better to secure the deal now."
