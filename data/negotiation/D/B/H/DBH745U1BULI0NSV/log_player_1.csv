Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd like to get closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and I believe I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original price. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price through further negotiation. I'm aiming for a higher price that reflects the product's true value to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and your desire to find a price that works for you.  However, $975,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000.  Let's try $1,025,000.  This price reflects the product's unique value and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $987,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I've only got 4 rounds left, and the negotiation is getting tedious.  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  I'd rather secure the deal and move on."
