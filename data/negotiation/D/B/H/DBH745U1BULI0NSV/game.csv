"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'd like to get closer to my target price.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  Considering the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down a bit further. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original price. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and your desire to find a price that works for you.  However, $975,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000.  Let's try $1,025,000.  This price reflects the product's unique value and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
