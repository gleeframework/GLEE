"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $20,000. I'm willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is considerably higher than your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16,000. This reflects a significant discount and ensures a win-win scenario.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the value I'll get from it.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your budget constraints. However,  $13,500 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I can do $14,500, and that's my final offer. This price reflects the true value of the product.",14500.0,Alice,5,
