Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value and potential.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message is open-ended to invite Bob to counter-offer.

**Strategy:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to $15,000, but I'm prepared to negotiate down if necessary. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll assess his counter-offer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation. If his offer gets too low, I'll be prepared to sell to John for $10,000 to avoid losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  Selling to John is a guaranteed $10,000, but there's a chance I can do better with Bob.  By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and explore if we can meet in the middle."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $12,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints while still aiming for a price higher than my minimum. 
* **Fair Price:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify my counteroffer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open for further discussion by asking for Bob's thoughts. 

**Strategy:**

By offering $12,500, I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price while still being within a reasonable range for Bob.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is only $1,000 less than my counteroffer of $12,500. 
* **Avoid Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely. 
* **Maximize Profit:** While not my ideal price, $11,000 is still a good profit and significantly better than selling to John for $10,000.

**Strategy:** It's important to balance the desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal altogether.  $11,000 is a reasonable compromise that ensures a sale and a decent profit."
