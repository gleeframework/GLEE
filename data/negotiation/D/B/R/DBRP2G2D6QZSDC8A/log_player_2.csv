"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you.  It's something that I'm confident will significantly benefit your operations and generate a strong return on investment.  I'm offering it to you for $950,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is still significantly higher than your alternative of buying from John for $1,000,000. 
* By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price. Alice might be motivated to lower her asking price to avoid losing the sale. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting this offer, you're aiming to negotiate a better deal with Alice. There's a chance she might come down closer to her product's value of $800,000."
