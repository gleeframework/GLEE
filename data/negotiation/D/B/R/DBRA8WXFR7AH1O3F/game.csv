"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as low as I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm proposing $1,125,000. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing $1,075,000. I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
