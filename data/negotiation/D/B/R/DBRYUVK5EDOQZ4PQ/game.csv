"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price seems a bit high for me. I'm more comfortable in the range of  $1,000,000.  Would that work for you?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your perspective on the price.  To be frank, $1,000,000 is considerably below my bottom line for this product.  Could you consider something closer to $1,700,000? I'm willing to negotiate, but that price point reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,700,000 is still  too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? ",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are getting closer. I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  While I can't do $1,350,000, I could be persuaded to accept  $1,550,000.  This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we are definitely getting close!  I could potentially stretch to $1,400,000, but that's the absolute limit for me.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
