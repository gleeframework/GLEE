Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, hoping to entice Bob and see if he's willing to negotiate. It's important to be friendly and emphasize the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $130. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if he's willing to increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to stick to a price closer to my initial offer. How about $135? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering a slight increase to $135, trying to find a middle ground while still remaining above my minimum. The message is friendly and focuses on a ""fair compromise""."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $130 again, as I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll reject Bob's offer again.  If he doesn't budge, I might be forced to sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $132. This is a final offer from me, as I really need to get at least this much for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 132}
```

I'm making a slight concession by dropping the price to $132.  This is my last offer, and I'm adding some pressure by emphasizing the ""final"" aspect.  I hope this will encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am comfortable sticking to my original counteroffer of $130. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It seems like Bob is firm on his price, and I'm getting close to my minimum.  It's not worth risking another round, as I'm already getting a good offer from John. I'm going to sell to John for $150 to ensure I get the best price possible."
