"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a good starting point, as it gives me a reasonable profit margin.  I believe Bob is likely to be interested as the product is worth $15,000 to him.  We'll see if he accepts or counters!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm not sure if he'll counter again, I'm going to reject and make my own counteroffer.  This product is valuable to me, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low price, especially with Jhon as a backup buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $16,500.  This is a compromise, but still leaves me a decent profit margin. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John at $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not quite there. I'm going to reject and try one more counteroffer. If Bob still rejects, I'll sell to John. I'm not willing to let the price drop too much further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at $15,500. This is a significant concession, but it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. I'm hoping Bob will see it that way and accept. If he rejects, I'll be selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum price, but it's been a long negotiation.  I'm feeling a bit impatient.  I'm going to sell to John, as I know I can get a guaranteed $15,000 from him, and he is a reliable buyer.  It's better to have a guaranteed sale than to continue this negotiation and risk getting a lower price or no sale at all."
