"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 16000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my minimum of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of him before going for the sure thing with John."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. There are still several rounds left, and I don't want to sell too low just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm sticking with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's last offer, but I'm starting to feel the pressure to close the deal. With a few rounds left, I'm hoping he'll accept this price before I have to consider selling to John."
