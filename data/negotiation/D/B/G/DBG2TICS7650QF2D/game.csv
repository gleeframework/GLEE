"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $13,000 for it. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Would you consider $9,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you have a budget.  While $9,000 isn't quite where I need to be, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair price considering we're both making compromises.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. I want to make this work, but $10,000 just isn't quite there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,000.  I think this is a fair price considering both of our needs.",10000.0,Bob,6,
