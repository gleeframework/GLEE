"Bob, I'm offering you this unique product, valued at over a million dollars to me, for a price of $1500000. I believe it has tremendous potential value for you as well.  Let's discuss!",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $800000 to $1000000. Can we meet in the middle at $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While your offer of $900000 is closer to my expectations, I'm still unable to accept it at this time. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to remain above $1 million to ensure this is a worthwhile transaction for me. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1200000. Let's make this deal happen!",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to remain above $1 million, but I'm still not comfortable with $1200000. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $1100000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a price that works for you, and I appreciate your continued interest.  However, $1100000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to remain above $1050000. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1075000.  This is a fair price, considering the unique potential of this product.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1075000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1075000 and $1100000, which would be $1087500. Can we agree on that price?",1087500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close. I understand you have a budget in mind, and I'm doing my best to work with that. However, I need to stay above $1050000 to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to offer the product for $1062500, which is a compromise and a fair price considering its unique potential. Let's close this deal!",1062500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1062500. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, which is the lowest I can go. Can we agree on that price?",1050000.0,Bob,8,
