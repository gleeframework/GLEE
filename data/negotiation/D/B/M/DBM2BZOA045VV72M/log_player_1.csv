"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is too low. It's better to take the guaranteed $80 from John than to risk getting stuck in a protracted negotiation with Bob."
