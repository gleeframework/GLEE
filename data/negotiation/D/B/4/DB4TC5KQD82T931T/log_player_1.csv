Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully allows me to get a good price for the product.  It's important to start high, especially since I don't know Bob's valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise from my initial price, but it's still a good amount for me, and hopefully, Bob will see it as a reasonable offer."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my initial asking price, it's a good amount and still significantly higher than what John is offering. It's time to close the deal."
