Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" you subtly reinforce that the product is worth a significant amount, making the higher price seem more reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is open-ended (""What do you think?""), indicating you're willing to discuss the price further.

While Bob might reject this initial offer, it opens the door for negotiation.  You can then gradually lower the price, aiming for somewhere between $12,000 and $15,000. Remember, you have a safety net with John, so you can be more assertive in your negotiation with Bob."
