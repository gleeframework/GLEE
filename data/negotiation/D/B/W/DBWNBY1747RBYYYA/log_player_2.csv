"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is within his budget, it's still a lot of money. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $900,000 is a substantial reduction from Alice's initial price and leaves room for negotiation.  This counteroffer is also well below Bob's maximum budget, leaving room for further bargaining if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. Rejecting the offer gives him another round to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product and is willing to compromise. However, he's still keeping the price below $1,000,000, demonstrating his desire to get a good deal. This counteroffer balances the need to show commitment while still aiming for a lower price."
