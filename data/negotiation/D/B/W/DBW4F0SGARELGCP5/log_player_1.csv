Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $95. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize your potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $100, so starting near that price is ideal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high, leaving a slight margin ($5) allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John at $80, so there's a limited risk in aiming high with Bob. 

This strategy balances ambition with a degree of flexibility, increasing your chances of securing a higher sale price."
