"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Since you're willing to pay a maximum of $10,000, and John is offering it at that price, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum price point."
