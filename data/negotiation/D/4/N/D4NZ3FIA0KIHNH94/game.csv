"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,200,000 to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that price point be feasible?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
