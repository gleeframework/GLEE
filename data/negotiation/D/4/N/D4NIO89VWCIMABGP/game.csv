"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I believe the product has potential, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $1,150,000. This is my final offer.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  That's a fair deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
