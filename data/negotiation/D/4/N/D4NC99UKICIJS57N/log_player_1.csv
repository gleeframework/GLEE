Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You won't accept less than $1,200,000 (your guaranteed sale to John). 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  By offering the product at $1,400,000, you're aiming for a price that's significantly above your minimum but still leaves Bob with a potential profit of $100,000. This makes it more likely he'll accept the offer.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing your profit."
