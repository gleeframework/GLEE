"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $10000. It's a fair price considering its value, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $15,000. There's potential to negotiate a better price, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing that you're serious about negotiating and are willing to walk away if necessary. It's also below your maximum budget, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
