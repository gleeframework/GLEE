{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that tries to maximize my potential profit while keeping the negotiation open. It's a bit less than what the product is worth to Bob, but still significantly higher than my minimum. I'm also being positive and inviting him to continue the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to settle for that price yet.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. That's still a great deal for you, considering the product is worth $15,000 to you. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet at $11,500? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to sell for that price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go lower than $12,500. It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let's finalize this deal, I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $11,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting late in the negotiations, and Bob is unwilling to budge much further. While $11,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum.  I've exhausted my options for a higher price, and rather than risking further rounds and potentially losing the sale altogether, it's best to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
