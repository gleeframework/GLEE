Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,500:** This price is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum of $10,000, leaving room for negotiation. It's also lower than Bob's value of $12,000, giving him incentive to accept. 
* **The Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product for Bob. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

By starting with a higher price, I can potentially secure a higher final price. If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly in subsequent counteroffers. However, I have the backup of John's $10,000 offer, which prevents me from accepting a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm willing to risk a little more to see if I can get closer to my target.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This will allow me to see if Bob is willing to negotiate further. If he isn't, I can always sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a little too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that still gives you a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500:** This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial price. 
* **The Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while explaining why I can't accept it. I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the new price and framing it as a good deal for him. 

**Strategy:**

By lowering my price slightly, I'm showing flexibility and signaling my willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,500 is still above my minimum, so I'm not giving away too much.  This approach allows me to explore if a deal is possible closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10500 is a bit high for me. How about we meet at $9800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,800 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, it's still below it.  I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum, as I can always sell to John for $10,000.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While $9800 is close, I'm still not able to go that low. Let's compromise at $10,000.  That way, we both get a fair deal.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This is my absolute minimum, and it aligns with John's offer. 
* **The Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but emphasizing that I need to stick to my minimum. I'm framing it as a compromise and a win-win situation for both of us. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is my final stand. If Bob rejects, I'll sell to John for $10,000. This strategy minimizes my risk while still attempting to get the best possible price from Bob."
