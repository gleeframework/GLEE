{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you first at a price of $150."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $100 gives you a safety net and more leverage in the negotiation. You're not desperate to sell at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $80 is significantly below both your minimum price ($100) and his own perceived value of the product ($100). 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a significant gap between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, indicating room for negotiation. 
* **Backup Option:** You have the security of selling to John for $100, so there's no need to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $150 represents the value I place on the product, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $115?"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate and move closer to Bob's price range.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering a price of $115 keeps the negotiation alive while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum and closer to Bob's perceived value. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** We haven't dropped below John's offer yet, preserving that option if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $115 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Value:** While Bob's offer has increased, $90 is still below both your minimum acceptable price and his perceived value of the product.
* **Closing the Gap:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate by increasing his offer, indicating a potential to reach a mutually beneficial price. 
* **John as Leverage:** You still have the option of selling to John for $100, which gives you leverage to push for a better price from Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground. Let's make it a deal at $100. That's my final offer, as it represents the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is your final offer, you create a sense of urgency and signal that you're unwilling to go any lower.
* **Meeting Your Minimum:**  $100 meets your absolute lowest acceptable price, ensuring you don't make a loss.
* **Fair Deal:**  Bob gets the product at his perceived value, and you secure a sale.
* **John No Longer Necessary:**  By offering your minimum price, you remove the need to involve John, simplifying the deal."
