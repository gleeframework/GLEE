"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still gives you a significant benefit over the value to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us to both get a good deal. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
