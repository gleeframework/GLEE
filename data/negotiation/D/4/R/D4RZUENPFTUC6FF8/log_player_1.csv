{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of $10,000. It leaves room for negotiation while still aiming to maximize my profit.  I'm also being friendly and encouraging a response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I think it's a bit above my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  I'm willing to be flexible to make this work."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm going to accept this offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation, potentially resulting in a lower price or needing to sell to John for $10,000."
