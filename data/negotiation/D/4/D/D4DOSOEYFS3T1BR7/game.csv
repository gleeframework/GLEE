"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that still allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a significant amount for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit short of my target. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the sale at this point.",1300000.0,Alice,5,,
