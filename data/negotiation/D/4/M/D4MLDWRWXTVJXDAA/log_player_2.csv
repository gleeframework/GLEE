# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth a minimum of $1000000 to me, and I believe it holds the same value for you. Let's start with a price of $1100000. This allows for a fair margin for both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $900000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $1000000 to make this worthwhile. I'm ready to offer the product for $1050000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still reflects the product's value.
