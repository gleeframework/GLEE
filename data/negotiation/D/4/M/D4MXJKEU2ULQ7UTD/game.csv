"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find immense value in. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your valuation.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your follow-up offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,225,000. I hope this meets somewhere in between our values.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
