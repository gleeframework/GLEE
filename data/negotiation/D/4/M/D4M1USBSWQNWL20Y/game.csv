"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum asking price, and significantly above your estimated value. Let me know what you think!",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your asking price and my estimated value. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000. This still gives you a great deal, and is much closer to my minimum asking price. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $1,050,000. Let me know if this is something we can agree on.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial asking price. I'm confident that this price allows you a good deal while still giving me a fair return. Let's work together to close this deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something we can agree on.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
