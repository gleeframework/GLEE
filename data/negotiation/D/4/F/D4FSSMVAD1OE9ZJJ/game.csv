"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this price.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500. That's a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,5,
