Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $119, you're leaving Bob with a small gain ($1) while maximizing your own profit. Bob is highly likely to accept this offer since it's just below his perceived value. 
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can always sell it to John for your minimum acceptable price."
