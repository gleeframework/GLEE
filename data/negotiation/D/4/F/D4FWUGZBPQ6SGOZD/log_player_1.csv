Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm aiming for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and might result in you getting a price closer to your ideal.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""value"" subtly implies it's worth the higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is not demanding, suggesting you're open to discussing the price.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** While you have John as a backup, it's not explicitly mentioned. This keeps the focus on Bob as the preferred buyer.

By starting at $10,000, Alice gives herself a chance to potentially earn an extra $2,000. Even if Bob negotiates down, Alice is still likely to get a better price than John's offer."
