"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. I propose a price of $13500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is better than Alice's initial asking price of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to engage in this discussion. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a proposal of $13000 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on it while remaining within your budget considerations.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your persistence and understanding throughout this negotiation process. I am willing to accept $12300 for the product. This price respects the value of the product and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,300.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,300 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  There's only one round left, and it's unlikely Alice will come down to Bob's target price. Therefore, it's more advantageous for Bob to purchase the product from John for $12,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
