"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than $100 from John, you can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, there's room for a price that benefits both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for a negotiation. It offers Alice a profit of $5, which is better than nothing if she rejects the offer. It also leaves room for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my ideal price, I still believe there is room for further negotiation. I'm willing to pay a bit more than $85, but $92 is still too high.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to $88. This is a reasonable compromise that still leaves Alice with a profit, and it's closer to my ideal price. I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, as it's only a few dollars away from her initial counteroffer. If she rejects, I'll likely accept John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90 is better than John's offer of $100. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and I risk losing the opportunity to buy the product at a good price.  It's time to accept the offer and move on."
