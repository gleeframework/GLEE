"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a little too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello again Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to consider $775,000? I think that's a fair offer.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hello Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're tough! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about this: I'll offer you $800,000. That's a significant jump from my last offer and it gets us very close to a deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable with $800,000. I'll make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling it to someone else. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,7,
