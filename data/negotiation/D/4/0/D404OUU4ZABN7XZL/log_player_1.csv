"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows for room to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob will be interested enough to make a counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is better than my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,700,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. I believe this price is fair considering Bob's counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $1,600,000 is a good price considering the negotiations and the time spent. It's closer to my initial asking price and well above my minimum value. I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
