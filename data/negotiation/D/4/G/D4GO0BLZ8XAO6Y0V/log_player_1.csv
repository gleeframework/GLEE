Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is unfortunately far above my budget. Given the value you place on the product, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price that allows for a reasonable profit for you while remaining within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer represents a significant discount from my original asking price while still ensuring a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This price allows for some room for negotiation, and is closer to my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and it's better to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than to risk further negotiation with Bob."
