"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000.  I believe it's a fair price, considering its value to you.  This offer is valid for the next 24 hours.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is slightly better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and purchasing from John for $1,000,000 is the most financially advantageous option."
