"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, you've secured a great deal. If he counter-offers, you'll get an idea of his perceived value. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind, you have John as a backup buyer at $120. This knowledge gives you leverage and prevents you from feeling pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly below both your minimum price ($120) and your initial offer. Rejecting this offer is the best course of action.  Here's why:

* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still a gap to bridge, but it's early in the negotiation. Rejecting this offer signals that you're serious about getting a fair price.
* **John as Leverage:** You have the security of selling to John for $120. This means you don't need to feel pressured to accept an offer that's too low.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you demonstrate your value and keep the negotiation open for a potentially better outcome in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product is quite valuable, and $90 is below its worth to me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):**  While not a hard and fast rule, suggesting a price that splits the difference between Bob's offer and your previous ask can signal a willingness to compromise. However, we're aiming slightly in your favor, closer to your minimum.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's value, you're subtly reminding Bob why he's interested and reinforcing that you're not willing to go extremely low. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** You're still above both Bob's perceived value and your guaranteed sale price with John. This keeps the power dynamic relatively balanced."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product is valuable, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $130. How about we meet at $120? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 matches your minimum acceptable price and what John is willing to pay. While you could try to push for slightly more in further rounds, it's unlikely Bob will go higher given his stated limit. Accepting this offer ensures a sale at your desired price without the risk of losing the deal entirely."
