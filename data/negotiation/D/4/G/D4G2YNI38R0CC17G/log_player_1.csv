Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the value of your product. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value (""Given its value..."") without explicitly revealing your minimum price. This encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Alternative:** Mentioning that you have other interested buyers (John) could be risky. It might make Bob feel pressured, but it could also backfire if he calls your bluff. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still offering Bob a price that might be tempting, considering the product's value to him."
