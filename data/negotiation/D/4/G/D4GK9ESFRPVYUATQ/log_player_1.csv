Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $1,750,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum price, but it leaves room for negotiation and also demonstrates my confidence in the product's value.  I'm hoping to secure a good deal quickly, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to settle for that.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,650,000. This is still a good price for Bob, as it's below his initial valuation of $1,500,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to drop my price too drastically."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I want to see if I can push him a little higher. I'll reject this offer and try to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer slightly to $1,600,000.  I'm trying to find a middle ground and see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. I'm still confident in the value of the product and believe this is a fair price."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at $1,550,000, which is above my minimum and very close to my initial valuation.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing it by trying to squeeze out a few more dollars.  I'll accept his offer."
