"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. However, $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500?  That's a fair price, considering the value of this product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $8,250? That's the highest I'm comfortable going for",8250.0,Bob,4,
