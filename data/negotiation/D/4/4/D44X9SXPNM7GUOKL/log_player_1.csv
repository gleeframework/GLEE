"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175.  This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate, but still leaves me with a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $155 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll try to negotiate a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $165. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer. I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has moved up to $160, which is only $5 below my initial asking price.  I'm happy to accept this offer, as it's a good price and I'm not sure I can get much more from Bob."
