"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss this valuable product with you. Given its unique nature and significant potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000. This is a starting point for our conversation, and I'm open to understanding your perspective on the value it brings to your specific needs."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) establishes a strong anchor point. This might shift his perception of the product's value upwards.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly states this is a starting point and invites Bob to share his perspective. This encourages a collaborative negotiation process rather than a confrontational one.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's features and benefits, the message hints at its ""unique nature"" and ""significant potential,"" leaving room for Bob to inquire and for you to further justify the high price.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:** Even if Bob negotiates you down, the high starting point leaves room for a final price significantly above your minimum.
2. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His reaction to the high price will give you valuable information about his willingness to pay and negotiating style. 
3. **Maintain the Option of John:**  If Bob is completely unwilling to negotiate within a reasonable range, you can always walk away and take John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,800,000 is well above my budget.  I'm genuinely interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 at this time. This is my maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value I'll bring to it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is his perceived maximum value, accepting it would leave a significant amount of money on the table. You know John is ready to pay $1,200,000, making Bob's offer instantly unappealing. 

It's time to counter-negotiate and see if you can bridge the gap without losing too much potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your interest in the product. I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,000,000 doesn't reflect the true worth of what this product can do. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price takes into account the unique advantages this product offers and allows us both to find a mutually beneficial outcome."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Not Drastic Reduction:**  A $200,000 decrease from your initial offer shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer, keeping the pressure on him to move closer to your range.
* **Focus on Value, Not Just Price:**  The message reiterates the product's unique benefits and positions the lower price as a strategic decision to achieve a ""mutually beneficial outcome,"" appealing to Bob's desire for fairness. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Stance:** You are still aiming for a price significantly higher than John's offer, leaving room for further negotiation while keeping your most profitable option open.

This approach seeks to:

1.  **Encourage Movement from Bob:** The significant price drop might prompt Bob to raise his offer considerably in the next round. 
2. **Maintain Negotiating Power:** By anchoring the new price at $1,600,000, you establish a new point from which to negotiate, hopefully closer to your desired outcome. 
3. **Avoid Appearing Desperate:**  You haven't rushed to accept John's offer, indicating confidence in reaching a deal with Bob that meets your requirements."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I believe $1,200,000 is a fair price that reflects the value I'll bring to the product.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 now matches John's standing offer.  While you started high hoping for more, it's unlikely Bob will go any higher, especially since he's labeled it his ""final offer."" 

Accepting this offer secures you your minimum desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a worse outcome."
