"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm offering $10,500 for the product.  This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good value for the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm offering $10,750.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this happen.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're committed to negotiating, and I appreciate that.  However, $10,750 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $10,875. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finally agree.",10875.0,Alice,5,
