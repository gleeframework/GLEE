"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm offering $10,500 for the product.  This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I need to make a decent profit. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good value for the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm offering $10,750.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my target, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I have a few more rounds to go, and I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're committed to negotiating, and I appreciate that.  However, $10,750 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $10,875. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finally agree."", ""product_price"": 10875}
