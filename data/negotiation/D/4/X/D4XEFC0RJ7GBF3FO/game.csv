"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a unique item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a bit below my target, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the value I believe it holds. I can offer it to you for $1400000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1400000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $1200000 is still below my target, and I'm not sure I'm willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more significant concession to try to reach an agreement. I can offer it to you for $1300000. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not sure I can go any higher than $1100000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this point.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to know that you're serious about the product. I can offer it to you for $1200000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
