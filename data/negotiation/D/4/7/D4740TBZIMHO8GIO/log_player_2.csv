"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $14,500 feels fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice ($12,000). This means there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $14,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is still a good price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway.  He's offering a price that's still above Alice's value for the product, but significantly lower than her initial offer. This shows he's serious about buying, but also that he's willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you see the value, but $13,000 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,750? It's a competitive price for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** $13,750 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's below his maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Progress:** Alice has moved from $14,500 to $13,750, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Risk:**  While Bob could try to get a lower price, there's a chance Alice could reject further counteroffers, and he might end up buying from John for $15,000.

Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price while minimizing risk."
