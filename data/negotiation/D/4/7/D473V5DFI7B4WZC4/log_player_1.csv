Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I think it's a steal for something of this quality and value."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay even slightly more.
* **High but Negotiable:** $11,999 is a high price, but it leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate if he's very interested. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The message implies the product is valuable and might entice Bob to act quickly rather than risk losing the deal. 

This strategy aims to get the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring the product is sold."
