Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This sets a high baseline and lets me see how much he values the product.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but always keeping in mind my minimum of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $975,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  This gives us a good chance to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's a bit lower than I'd hoped, it's still a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation.  There's always a chance Bob might reject my next counteroffer, and I'm not sure I can get much higher than this. It's better to secure a solid $925,000 than risk ending up with John's $800,000 offer."
