Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable agreement. Would you consider selling the product to me for $1500000?

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While I'm willing to sell to John for $1,500,000, I believe I can get more from Bob. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1600000 for the product. This still falls within my budget while allowing us to come closer to a mutual agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,600,000 is still a good deal and allows me to avoid the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
