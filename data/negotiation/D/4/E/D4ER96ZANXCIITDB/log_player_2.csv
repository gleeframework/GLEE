"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob can get a better deal than $12,000.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $11,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $12,000. This price is still above Alice's value of $10,000, leaving room for her to potentially accept. This counteroffer demonstrates that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to negotiate for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer. However, it's still below Bob's maximum price of $15,000.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price. The goal is to find a price that is favorable to Bob, but also acceptable to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $11,500. This demonstrates that he is still interested in buying the product but is willing to negotiate within a reasonable range. It's a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest counteroffer. This price is still significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $12,500, and it's a price that might be acceptable to both parties, keeping the negotiation process moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. There's a chance that Alice might be willing to lower her price even further, especially if she wants to avoid losing the deal to John.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and provides an opportunity for Bob to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer again to $12,000. This is a significant increase from his previous offer but still below Alice's current offer of $13,000. By increasing his offer, Bob is showing Alice that he is serious about buying the product and is willing to meet her halfway. This could potentially lead to a successful negotiation and a final price that is beneficial to both parties."
