"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe you'd find very useful. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. That's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference.  How about $9,000? That's a reasonable compromise for both of us and keeps the deal moving forward.",9000.0,Bob,4,
