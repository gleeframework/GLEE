"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $1,150,000 is still above what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident it reflects the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
