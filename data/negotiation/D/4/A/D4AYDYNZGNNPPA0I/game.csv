"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to consider a price of $9,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500. Let's try to close this deal, as I'm sure we can both be happy with this price.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer the product to you for $10,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
