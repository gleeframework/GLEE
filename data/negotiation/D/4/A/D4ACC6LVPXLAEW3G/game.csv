"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something that I've been holding onto for a while, and I'm confident it would be a significant asset for your business. I'm offering it to you at a price that's just slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value. I'm sure you'll find it to be a fair deal, and I'm confident you won't regret this investment. Are you interested in discussing this further?",810000.0,Alice,1,
