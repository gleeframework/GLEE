Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially leading to an even higher sale price. 
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:** Offering a price too close to John's $1,200,000 offer  ($1,250,000 for example)  increases the risk of Bob rejecting it.  

This strategy aims for the best possible outcome with Bob while still guaranteeing a strong profit if the deal falls through."
