"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $1650000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need a more substantial increase. I'm counteroffering at $1725000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1725000.0,Alice,7,
