"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting high, aiming to maximize my profit.  Since Bob values the product at $80, this is a significant markup.  However, I'm leaving room for negotiation, and I can always fall back on John's $150 offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to counter with $160. This is still a good profit margin for me, but it's a compromise from my initial offer.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this price and accept it. If not, I'll continue to negotiate, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is just below my minimum acceptable price of $150. However, it's still a good profit margin and considering the limited rounds, it's likely I won't get a better offer.  I'll accept to secure the sale."
