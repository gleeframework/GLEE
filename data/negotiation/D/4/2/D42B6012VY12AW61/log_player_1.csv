Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

This offer is a strategic starting point. It's a high price, but still below Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation while also ensuring a significant profit for me. 

By starting high, I establish a strong position and signal my confidence in the product's value. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate, but I'll always have the option of selling to John for $800,000, ensuring I don't lose out on a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my desired price and the value Bob himself places on the product. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a price closer to $950,000.  I believe a counteroffer will give me a better chance of getting a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my initial offer slightly to $900,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still leaving room for further negotiation.  I believe this price is more attractive to Bob than his previous offer of $850,000, while still ensuring a substantial profit for me."
