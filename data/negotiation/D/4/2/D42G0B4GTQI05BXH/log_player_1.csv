Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter his offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is still a good price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $925,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a significant profit and much better than selling to John for $800,000. Further negotiation might lead to a higher price, but there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely. Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and secures a good profit."
