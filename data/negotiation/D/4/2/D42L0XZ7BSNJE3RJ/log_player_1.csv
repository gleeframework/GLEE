{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not asking for my full minimum value ($10,000). This makes the offer seem more reasonable and encourages Bob to counter.
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning John as a potential buyer subtly creates a sense of urgency, pushing Bob to make a decision.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a negotiation that leads to a price between $9,000 and $9,500. This would be a good outcome for both of us, allowing me to earn more than John's offer and giving Bob a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000. Accepting this offer would result in a considerable loss for me.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Testing Bob's commitment:**  This rejection will show Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price. It might encourage him to increase his offer.

**Next Step:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price somewhere between $9,000 and $9,500. This will show him that I'm willing to negotiate but that I also value the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250.  This would be a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer ($9,500) and Bob's offer ($8,500). This shows a willingness to compromise and makes the offer seem fair.
* **Maintaining a High Value:**  $9,250 is still above my minimum value of $10,000, so I'm not settling for a significant loss.
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:**  The message highlights that this price is a good deal for both of us, encouraging Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price closer to my desired range, I'm increasing the chances of reaching a deal with Bob.  If he rejects again, I will need to reassess my options, considering the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8,800? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $8,800 is significantly below my minimum value of $10,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob is likely to result in further price reductions and an unacceptable outcome for me.
* **Time is of the essence:**  It's becoming clear that Bob is not willing to meet me halfway.  Continuing to negotiate with him is wasting time and potentially preventing me from getting a better deal with John.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John ensures that I receive my minimum value and a guaranteed profit. 

**Strategy:**

By selling to John, I'm making a rational decision that guarantees me the best outcome. While I would prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, his stubbornness has made this impossible."
