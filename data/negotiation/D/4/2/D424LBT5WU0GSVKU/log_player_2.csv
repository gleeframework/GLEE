Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,075,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, Bob is still better off buying from John.  There's still a $75,000 difference, and Bob can try to negotiate further to get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,075,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though. I'll offer the product to you for $1,060,000. This is my final counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now firm on her price of $1,060,000. While this is still a lower price than her initial offer, Bob is still better off buying from John for $1,000,000.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation, as Alice may not be willing to budge further."
