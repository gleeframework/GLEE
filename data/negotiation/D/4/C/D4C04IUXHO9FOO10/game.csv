"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a reasonable price.",95.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. However, given the cost and value I've invested in this product, I cannot agree to $80. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",85.0,Alice,3,
