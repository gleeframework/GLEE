Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. However, given the cost and value I've invested in this product, I cannot agree to $80. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.
