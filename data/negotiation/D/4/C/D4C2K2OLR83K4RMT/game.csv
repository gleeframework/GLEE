"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm starting to think that $13000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm now offering the product to you for $14500. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and my costs.
