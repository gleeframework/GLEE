"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1000000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with my budget while still offering a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, taking into account the product's worth to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. However, I must respectfully decline your counteroffer. Given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet at a price higher than $950000. I hope this aligns closer to what you're looking for, and I remain open to discussing other terms if possible.",950000.0,Bob,4,
