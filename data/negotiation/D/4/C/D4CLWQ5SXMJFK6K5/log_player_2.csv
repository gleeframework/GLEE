"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I know I can get the product for $100 from John, and it's worth negotiating to see if Alice will come down closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for offering, Alice!  That price is a little high for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for further negotiation while still aiming for a price well below John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $95?  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, I think there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to counteroffer one more time before accepting defeat and going with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $80 was a bit optimistic. How about we split the difference and settle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

This counteroffer shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate and meet her closer to the middle, but I'm still aiming for a price below John's offer."
