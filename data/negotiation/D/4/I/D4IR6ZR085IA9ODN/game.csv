"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering it's worth at least $12,000 to me. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,250. That's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to me.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Let's try $8,750.  It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,000.  This gives us both a fair price, and we can finally close the deal.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $9,000 is still a little too high for me.  How about we meet at $8,800?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",8800.0,Bob,6,
