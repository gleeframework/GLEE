"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $11000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $12500.  It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair profit.  What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",12000.0,Bob,4,
