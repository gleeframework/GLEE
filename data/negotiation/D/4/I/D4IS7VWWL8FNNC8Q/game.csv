"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your work, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with its performance. I'm initially suggesting a price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and what it can achieve for you.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. I believe this is a fair and competitive price considering the value this product will bring you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
