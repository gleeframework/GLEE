"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want to make a good deal, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  How about $10,750?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the outcome.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me in the middle.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still not comfortable going below $11,000.  It's a great product, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,875? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",10875.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,875 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet at $10,700?  This would allow us both to walk away with a good deal.",10700.0,Bob,6,
