"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you and I'm happy to discuss a deal. To start, I'm offering it at $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm aiming high initially to leave room for negotiation and gauge Bob's willingness to pay. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:** The price is slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000), aiming to capture a significant portion of the potential surplus.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm prepared to negotiate down, but starting high gives me a stronger position. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm aware I have John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000, which gives me a strong bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is tempting, I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I'm willing to engage in further rounds of negotiation to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement. My backup offer from John provides a safety net, but I'm confident I can secure a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob, and I appreciate you working with me. While $1,250,000 is a respectable offer, the product's value to you is undeniable. How about we settle at $1,350,000? This allows both of us to walk away feeling good about the deal."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm signaling flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer but holding firm above his initial suggestion.  
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits and justifying a higher price.
* **Seeking Compromise:** My counteroffer aims to find a compromise, splitting the difference between our previous offers to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, Alice, but $1,350,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,350,000, so how about $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored at $1,250,000 and incrementally moving upwards. While I'd ideally like to get closer to $1,350,000, accepting his offer of $1,300,000 secures a significant profit above my minimum ($1,000,000) and John's offer. Continuing to push for a higher price risks Bob walking away, and $300,000 profit is a very strong outcome."
