"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit.  How about $10,000?  That's a fair offer that allows both of us to benefit.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but I think that's as high as I can go. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're close, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  How about we settle this right now at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting a bit stuck. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I think we both know I'm still not getting my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this negotiation has gone on long enough.  I'm willing to pay $10,750, but that's my final offer.  Take it or leave it.",10750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid it's still not enough. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll go up to $11,500, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,9,
