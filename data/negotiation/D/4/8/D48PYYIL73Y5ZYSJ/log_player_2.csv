"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Value:** The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $12,000. This means Bob can potentially save $3,000 by negotiating further.
* **Counteroffer:** Bob has room to make a lower counteroffer.  Even if Alice doesn't accept immediately, it's a good starting point for negotiations.
* **Alternative:** While John offers a higher price, Bob can always choose to buy from him if negotiations with Alice fail. 

Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm looking to pay closer to $9,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's original offer but still within Bob's budget. It demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** The message is polite and shows that Bob is still interested in the product. 
* **Strategy:** By starting with a lower price, Bob creates room for negotiation.  Alice may counter with a price closer to $9,000, or Bob can adjust his offer again if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $10,000? That's still a great price for you, and it gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Value:** The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $10,000.  This represents a significant saving of $5,000.
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a good chance Alice won't budge lower. 
* **Alternative:** Buying from John would cost $15,000, making Alice's offer much more attractive. 

Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to secure the product at a great price without risking further negotiations or having to pay John's higher price."
