"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  $1,000,000 is still too high for him, and he knows he can buy from John for $1,200,000 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  I think this price is fair, given the value you place on it and my maximum budget."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm offering the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on it and the minimum I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than he wants to pay. He has room to negotiate further and can likely get a better price.  He knows he can always buy from John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer you $850,000 for the product. This price reflects the value you've placed on it, and it's the highest I'm able to offer at this time."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $850,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $975,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He has already come down to $850,000 and Alice is only willing to move $25,000 closer to his offer.  He should try to counter-offer again to see if he can get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your minimum, but $975,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This represents a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering your minimum and my maximum.  I hope we can reach an agreement at this point."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not getting close enough to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach an agreement with you. I'm offering the product to you for $995,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a little lower than her previous offer, it's still more than he's comfortable paying. He's already come down significantly from his starting point, and he still has room to negotiate. It's best to try to get closer to his desired price before making a final decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $995,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a substantial increase on my previous offer and reflects my sincere desire to reach an agreement. I hope we can finally settle on this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I've already made significant concessions and I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer. I'm starting to think that we're not going to be able to come to an agreement. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at my minimum price, but I'm not going to make another concession. I'm offering the product to you for $980,000, but this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. He has already come down to a price of $950,000 and Alice is only willing to drop to $980,000.  It's better to buy from John for $1,200,000 since it's only slightly more than Alice's final offer.  

This is a good compromise, considering that he can get the product for less than his initial maximum price and avoid further negotiation.  He's also had a chance to see that Alice may not be flexible in her pricing, making it unlikely he'll get a lower price with her."
