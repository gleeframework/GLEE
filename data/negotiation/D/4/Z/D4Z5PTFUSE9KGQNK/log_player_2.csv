"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I should make a counteroffer below $7,500 to see if I can get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I can offer it to you for $7,200. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?

Alice is coming down in price, which is good. However, there's still room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer a bit closer to her price to see if we can meet in the middle."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to consider your proposal, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet. I can offer you a compromise at $7,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?

Alice is negotiating in good faith, and $7,000 is a reasonable price, saving me $1,000. It's unlikely I'll get a much better deal, and further haggling could risk losing the opportunity."
