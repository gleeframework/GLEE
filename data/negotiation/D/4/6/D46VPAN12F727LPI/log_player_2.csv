"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $150 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything higher than that. You should try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $120 to Alice, a price of $130 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing you to save money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what you're willing to pay from John. You should try to negotiate a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've already offered $130 and Alice rejected it. Increasing your offer to $135 is a compromise. It's still cheaper than John's price, but it demonstrates that you're willing to negotiate. This might encourage Alice to accept your offer, especially if she's eager to sell the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already rejected your offer of $135, and now she's back to her original offer of $140. You've already established that you're willing to pay $135, and you're unlikely to get a lower price from her. Since John is willing to sell the product to you for $150, it's more beneficial to go with John at this point.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as you're unlikely to get a better deal."
