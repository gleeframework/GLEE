"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* Buying from John at $1,500,000 is also not ideal.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,400,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your position, but I believe the product's true value is closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $1,350,000?  This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's new offer of $1,350,000 is within your budget of $1,500,000 and is a better price than John's offer.
* While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll be stuck with John's higher price. 
* Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price, avoiding the risk of a prolonged negotiation."
