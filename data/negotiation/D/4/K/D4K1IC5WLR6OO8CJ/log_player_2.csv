"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our flagship product, which I believe holds immense value for you, just like it does for me. This product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $950,000. This is an exceptional opportunity to secure such a valuable asset at a discount. I look forward to your consideration and hope we can make this transaction happen. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further information. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a better deal than buying from John for $1,000,000.  Even though the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, saving $50,000 is a significant benefit."
