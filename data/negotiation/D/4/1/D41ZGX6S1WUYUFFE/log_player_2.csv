{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is too high. It's better to reject and see if you can get a better deal from Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's price but still higher than John's offer. This gives me room to negotiate while still showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product.  I'm hoping Alice will be motivated to accept a lower price, given that she's already lost some money compared to her initial asking price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1320000}

This should keep the negotiation progressing, as both of us are moving towards a compromise."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1310000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has consistently lowered her price, and now it's only $10,000 higher than my last offer. This counteroffer increases my offer by $10,000, showing a willingness to compromise and aiming for a quick close. Given the small difference and the limited rounds left, it's a good strategy to make a small jump and hopefully reach a deal."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than John's offer, but we are down to the last round. It's not worth risking the deal and potentially losing out on a product I want.  At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the best option.  Even though I didn't get the price I initially hoped for, it's still a reasonable deal considering the constraints of the negotiation."
