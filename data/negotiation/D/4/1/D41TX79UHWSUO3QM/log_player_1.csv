{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also conveys that you're willing to work with Bob to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer him with a price closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $850,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? It's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $880,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

While I would prefer a higher price, $880,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and higher than what John is offering. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
