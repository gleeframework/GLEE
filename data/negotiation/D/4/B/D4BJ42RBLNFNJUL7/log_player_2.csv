"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you have the potential to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed with your backup option of buying from John."
