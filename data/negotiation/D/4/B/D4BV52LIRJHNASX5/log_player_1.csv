Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your confidence in its value. However, given my current financial situation, I am not able to commit to a price as high as $2,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

Bob is clearly anchored to the $1,800,000 price point. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk he walks away or I waste time I could use to explore other opportunities. Accepting his offer secures a good profit."
