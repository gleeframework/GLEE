"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. With that said, I'm willing to part with it for $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.  This seems like a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can work something out.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product for $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into acquiring it. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000, which is a significant amount and demonstrates my sincere interest in purchasing this product.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $725,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
