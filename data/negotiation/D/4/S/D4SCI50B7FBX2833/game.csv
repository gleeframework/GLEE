"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $950000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in making a serious offer of $750000. This is my best price, and I'm confident it's a fair value for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $750000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, but also takes into account your budget constraints.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $825000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while also staying within my budget.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $835000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",835000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm prepared to offer a final price of $810000. This is very close to my maximum budget, but I believe it reflects the value of the product while still being a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this.",810000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm impressed by your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $810000.
