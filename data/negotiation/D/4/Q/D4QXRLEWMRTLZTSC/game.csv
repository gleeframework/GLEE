"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1400000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to compromise, though. Let's meet in the middle at $1700000. This would still allow you a substantial discount from my initial offer, and it's closer to the value I see in this product.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1700000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from the middle, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
