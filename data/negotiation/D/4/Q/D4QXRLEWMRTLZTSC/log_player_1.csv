"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it has immense value. Let's discuss further."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:**  The message highlights the product's unique qualities and potential value to entice Bob. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message invites further discussion, signaling flexibility and a willingness to reach a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy aims to establish a high initial price and gauge Bob's interest while keeping open the option to negotiate down or sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I can't accept an offer that undervalues the product. 

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap and find a more agreeable price while remaining within my minimum threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to compromise, though. Let's meet in the middle at $1,700,000. This would still allow you a substantial discount from my initial offer, and it's closer to the value I see in this product."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I acknowledge Bob's point while emphasizing my own minimum acceptable price. 
* **Midpoint Offer:**  The offer of $1,700,000 is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I subtly remind Bob of the product's value, hopefully encouraging him to reconsider.

By offering a compromise and highlighting the value, I aim to keep the negotiation moving forward while maintaining my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1700000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from the middle, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll reach a higher price, and I risk losing valuable time. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and successful transaction, meeting my financial goals. Selling to John for the same price wouldn't provide any additional benefit."
