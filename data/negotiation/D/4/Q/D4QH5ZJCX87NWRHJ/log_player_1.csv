Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Value:** I emphasize the value of the product to Bob, hoping to incentivize him to consider my offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I leave the door open for negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts.

**Strategy:** 

* This initial offer is a starting point. I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I'll only lower my price if I believe it's necessary to secure the deal.
* If Bob rejects the offer, I will assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer myself. 
* I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, ensuring I don't accept a deal significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price and my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** I want to see if I can push Bob further. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price.

**Strategy:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, but still below my minimum acceptable value. 
* I'll aim to find a price that is both appealing to Bob and profitable for me.
* I'll continue to monitor John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer to my target, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the true value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Approach:** I'm offering a price that's roughly halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, hoping to make my counteroffer more appealing.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, inviting Bob to share his thoughts. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to find a balance between maximizing my profit and securing a deal. 
* I'm confident that $1,150,000 is a good price for both of us.
* I'll continue to monitor John's offer as a safety net, prepared to walk away if Bob's counteroffers become too low."
