Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,900,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer above your target price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting high, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point. Even if the initial offer is rejected, it might influence Bob's counteroffer to be more favorable than if you started lower.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup buyer gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price given the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is higher than what he values the product at ($1,200,000). This suggests there's room for further negotiation.
* **Below John's Offer:** Accepting Bob's offer would net you less than selling directly to John ($1,400,000 vs. $1,500,000). 
* **Aiming Higher:**  While your initial offer was ambitious, it's worth trying to secure a deal closer to your minimum acceptable price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're serious about getting a better price and open the door for a counteroffer on your part."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market value, however,  the value of this product to me is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  I believe this reflects a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Coming down by $150,000 from the initial offer shows a willingness to negotiate but also signals the significance of the product's value to you.
* **Above Bob's Valuation:**  The new offer is still well above Bob's valuation, giving him incentive to potentially counter with a higher price.
* **Closer to John's Offer:**  While you're getting closer to John's offer, the potential profit from a successful negotiation with Bob is still a driving factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value to you, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,550,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeds John's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is now more profitable than selling to John for $1,500,000.
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:**  Bob stating this is his ""final offer"" suggests he's unlikely to go higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob entirely, potentially forcing you to settle for John's offer. Accepting the current offer secures a profit above your minimum."
