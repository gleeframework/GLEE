Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a game-changer in its industry and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $12500. It's a fair price considering its value and potential returns.,12500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12500 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and offer the product for $11250. It's still a great deal considering the product's value and potential returns.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $10000, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I think this price is still a great deal for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $10000. I can offer the product for $9750. It's the best I can do.",9750.0,Alice,9,
