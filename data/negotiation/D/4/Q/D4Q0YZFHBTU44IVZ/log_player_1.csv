{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it is higher than the product's worth to Bob. This gives him incentive to negotiate, while still allowing me some room to lower the price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $150, and I'm confident I can get a better offer from him.  I'll counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is a significant discount from my original price.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're making a compromise, but $100 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $75? That seems like a fair price to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $75 is still well below what the product is worth. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $85. That's a good deal for both of us, and I think we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 85}
