Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $75 is still well below what the product is worth. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $85. That's a good deal for both of us, and I think we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $85 and that's above your maximum price. It's time to cut your losses and go with John's offer."
