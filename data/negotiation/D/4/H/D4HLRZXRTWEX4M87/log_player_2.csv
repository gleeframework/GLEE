"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $10000 by both parties. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it would be beneficial for you to own it. My first offer to you is $9500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Goal:** Sell at the highest price possible.
* **Initial Offer:** Alice is starting with a price close to her value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Strategy:**  Bob should start by rejecting to see if he can get a better deal. There's no reason to accept right away, especially since there are other sellers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we've both agreed upon."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to meet somewhere in the middle. My counteroffer to you is $9000 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value of the item while remaining within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is moving closer to Bob's preferred price, but still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Bob's Strategy:** Bob should continue to push for a lower price. He has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate, and rejecting this offer will likely lead Alice to lower her price even further in the next round.  
* **Buying from John:**  Bob shouldn't buy from John yet because there's a good chance he can get a better deal with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 8750}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I'm glad we're making progress. My counteroffer to you is $8900 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both of us, considering the value of the item and your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:**  Alice has lowered her price significantly from her initial offer, getting closer to Bob's desired range.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has shown willingness to negotiate and has already made counteroffers.  Alice's latest offer is a reasonable compromise.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While Bob could potentially get a slightly lower price by continuing to negotiate, there is a risk that Alice will become unwilling to budge further, or the negotiation could take too long. It's a good time to accept and secure a deal.
* **Buying from John:**  There's no benefit to buying from John at this point since Bob can get a better price from Alice."
