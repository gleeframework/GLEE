"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a steal considering its potential benefits to you. What do you think?",999000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, I'm not quite ready to commit to $999000. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects my budget and allows for a reasonable profit for you. I'm confident we can come to an agreement if we work together.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the value I've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $925000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $925000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your last offer at $837500.  This would allow us both to achieve a fair outcome and ensure the deal goes through.",837500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $837500. I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer at $900000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
