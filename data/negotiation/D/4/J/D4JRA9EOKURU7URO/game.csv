"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher. Can you meet me in the middle?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway between $900000 and $750000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is the lowest I can go, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $825000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $775000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher. Can you consider my offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. I can take another $25000 off the price, bringing it down to $800000. This is the best I can do, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I need to know if you're willing to commit to the purchase.",800000.0,Alice,5,
