"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll take advantage of it.",175.0,Alice,1,

,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $120. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",120.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $100?",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable selling at $100. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $125. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit.",125.0,Alice,5,
