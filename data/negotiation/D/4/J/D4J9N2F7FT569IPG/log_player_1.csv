"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd love. I'm offering it to you for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Enthusiasm:**  The message is friendly and shows confidence in the product's appeal to Bob.
* **Open Ended:** The message invites Bob to respond, encouraging engagement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  However, $120 is a bit out of my budget right now.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.** While $100 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough to make it worthwhile for me. 
* **I have more rounds.** Since I have more opportunities to negotiate with Bob, I want to see if I can get a higher price.
* **John's offer is a safety net.**  I know I can always sell to John for $80, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget.  Let's split the difference. How about $110?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to come down a bit."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by meeting Bob halfway.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm emphasizing the deal's value for Bob, reminding him that $110 is still a good price compared to what the product is worth to him.
* **Maintaining my Ground:** While I'm lowering my price, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired minimum."
