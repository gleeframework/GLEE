"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offer and your counteroffer. How about we try $11,000? It's a fair price that still reflects the value I believe the product holds for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
