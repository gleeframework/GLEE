"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is a decent amount, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'm confident enough in the value of the product to continue negotiating."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for improvement, especially since we're still early in the negotiation process. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14200}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. We're already halfway through the negotiations, so I want to see if I can squeeze out a few more dollars before considering selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13900}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,900. This is a smaller decrease from my previous offer, but I want to keep the negotiation moving. I'm hoping that we're getting close to a point where Bob is willing to accept, and this offer is a good middle ground.  I'm also keeping in mind that if we don't reach an agreement soon, I can always sell to John for $12,000."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We're nearing the end of our negotiations, and while I would prefer to get a slightly higher price, $13,600 is still a significant amount above my minimum. It's also important to consider that I could always sell to John for $12,000, but this offer is a better deal for me right now.  It's time to close the deal."
