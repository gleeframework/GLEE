Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $11,500.  This is a limited-time offer."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so offering it above that is necessary.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy it for $12,000 provides a strong bargaining position.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrasing the offer as ""limited-time"" and highlighting it's not yet public can encourage Bob to act quickly. 

By starting high, there's room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. If Bob rejects the $11,500, Alice can still sell to John for the guaranteed $12,000."
