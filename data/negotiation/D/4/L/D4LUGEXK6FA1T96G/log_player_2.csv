"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be highly valuable to your business.  I've valued it at $1,400,000, considering its unique features and potential for growth. I'm confident this price represents a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than your target price ($1,500,000).**  
* **You can get the product for less from John ($1,500,000), but it's still within your budget.**
* **It's better to reject Alice's offer and explore other options, including buying from John, to potentially save more money.**"
