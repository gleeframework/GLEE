"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
