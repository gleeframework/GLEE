"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  I understand its value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price.  My initial offer is $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language to build rapport with Bob and encourage him to stay in the negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to justify my initial price. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find the highest possible price within the 10 rounds while still potentially having the option to sell to John for my minimum. Starting high allows me to explore the upper range of potential deals before potentially needing to go lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1250000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.**  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sacrifice such a substantial amount of profit.
* **There are still rounds left.**  I have time to negotiate further with Bob and potentially reach a more acceptable price.
* **Selling to John remains a viable option.**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still guarantee my minimum profit by selling to John.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm serious about achieving a price closer to my initial offer. I'll counter with a price that is still above Bob's offer but potentially lower than my initial offer, continuing to explore a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  It's important we find a price that reflects the true value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This gives us both a fair outcome and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1325000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting a middle ground between my last offer and Bob's, I'm showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive tone encourages Bob to continue the negotiation and find a solution.

**Strategy:**

I'm still above my minimum price and am leaving room for negotiation in subsequent rounds. My goal is to gradually lower my price while remaining above Bob's initial offer, ultimately hoping to reach a price closer to my initial offer.  If this counteroffer fails, I'll continue to analyze Bob's responses and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far off from my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1300000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still $200,000 below what I consider the product to be worth. 
* **Negotiation Room:** We've only had 4 rounds, and I have time to continue negotiations and potentially get a better price.
* **John is Still an Option:** If negotiations fail, I can still sell to John for my minimum.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to $1,325,000. By rejecting his offer, I'm showing that I'm still committed to getting a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my offer.  However, $1,300,000 is still not quite there for me.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,312,500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to move forward with this deal. "", ""product_price"": 1312500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm making a small concession, demonstrating flexibility while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** I'm proposing a price that is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm actively trying to reach a compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits of moving forward and closing the deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, while still remaining flexible and open to compromise. By proposing a middle ground, I hope to encourage Bob to accept my counteroffer. If he doesn't, I'll continue to analyze his responses and adjust my strategy in the next rounds.  With John as a backup, I'm not pressured to accept an offer that's significantly lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far off from my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're in round 6, and I'm getting close to the end of the negotiation process.
* **No Significant Progress:**  Despite several rounds of negotiation, Bob has only budged $50,000 from his initial offer. This indicates that he might not be willing to come up much further.
* **Minimum Guaranteed:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit of $1,500,000.  This is a more secure option than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price.

**Strategy:**

It's better to secure the guaranteed profit now with John than risk further rounds with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price or no deal at all."
