"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive tone helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $175 is not my absolute bottom line, so I can still lower the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $130. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $130 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** I believe there's room to reach a deal that's more beneficial to me. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.
* **Keeping options open:** While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I'm not desperate. I'm aware that I can sell to John for $150 at any point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $130 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still higher than my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility while still trying to maximize my profit.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, appealing to Bob's sense of value. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation open and friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $160 is still a bit high for me. I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm really only comfortable with paying $140.  Let's see if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to the minimum:** While $140 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, I believe I can still get a better deal.
* **Potential for a better offer:** I'm not in a hurry, and I'm confident that with further negotiation, I can convince Bob to pay closer to my desired price.
* **Keeping options open:** I'm still aware of the option to sell to John for $150, which gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $140 is still a little lower than where I need to be.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $145.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This strategy shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. It also makes the offer seem more reasonable to Bob.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  Highlighting that the price is ""fair for both of us"" can make Bob feel more comfortable with the deal.
* **Keeping the Negotiation Going:**  The message is positive and encourages Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $145 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm going to stick with my offer of $140. If you can't accept that, I'm going to have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **No further room for negotiation:** Bob has been consistent with his offer of $140, and I've already lowered my price from $175 to $145.  There's not much room left for compromise.
* **Time is a factor:** We're already halfway through the 10 rounds. Continuing to negotiate with Bob might not lead to a higher offer and could potentially waste valuable time.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $150, which is higher than Bob's final offer and meets my minimum acceptable price.

Therefore, it's in my best interest to sell to John and secure a guaranteed profit."
