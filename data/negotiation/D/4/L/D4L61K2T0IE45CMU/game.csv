"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $130. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $130 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. Let's see if we can find common ground.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $160 is still a bit high for me. I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm really only comfortable with paying $140.  Let's see if we can agree on this price.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $140 is still a little lower than where I need to be.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $145.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $145 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm going to stick with my offer of $140. If you can't accept that, I'm going to have to explore other options.",140.0,Bob,6,
