"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations for the negotiations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your response, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am unable to agree on a price higher than $950,000. Considering this, I would like to make a final counteroffer of $975,000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
