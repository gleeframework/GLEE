Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $800,000.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a strong offer ($1,300,000) aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below $800,000, but this offer aims to secure a much higher profit."
