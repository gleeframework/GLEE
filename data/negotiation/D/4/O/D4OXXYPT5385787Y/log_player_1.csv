"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $170 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $170, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm friendly and open to discussion, emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a deal. 

**Strategy:**

I want to start high to maximize my profit, but I also want to keep the door open for negotiations and avoid immediately going to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $140 for the product. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing negotiations. 

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's not profitable enough for me. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, as I believe I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a good deal considering the value of this product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $160, which is a compromise from my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while reiterating the value of the product and suggesting a middle ground. 

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a price that's acceptable to both of us. I'm not giving in too much, but I'm also showing flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $150 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* There is no point in continuing the negotiation, as I'm unlikely to get a better offer from Bob, and John is also offering the same price. 

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice. I'm getting my minimum acceptable price and avoiding the risk of further negotiation."
