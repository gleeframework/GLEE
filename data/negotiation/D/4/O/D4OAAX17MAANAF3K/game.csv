"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I value it highly, but I'm open to discussing a price that benefits us both.  How about we start the conversation at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, your starting price is quite a bit higher than what I'm able to pay at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price given my budget, and I'm confident it's a deal that will benefit both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,800,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to meet you closer to your range. How about we consider $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
