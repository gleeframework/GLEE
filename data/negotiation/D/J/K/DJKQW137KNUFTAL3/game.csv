"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $10500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $9000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth.
