{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. This gives me a strong starting point while also being within a reasonable range for a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $11,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $9,000 is too low for me.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit,  how about $10,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still keeping the price higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $10,500 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $10,250 is a more reasonable price. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $10,250 is a good compromise, and it's much closer to my desired price than selling to John.  I'm confident this is the best outcome for me."
