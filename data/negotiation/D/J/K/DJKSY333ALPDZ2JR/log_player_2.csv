"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's enthusiasm is nice, her offer is the maximum you're willing to pay. There's no benefit to accepting her offer over buying from John. By rejecting, you might be able to negotiate a better price or find a better deal elsewhere."
