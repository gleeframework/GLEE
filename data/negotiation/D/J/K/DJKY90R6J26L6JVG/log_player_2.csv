"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you my unique product. It holds great value to me, and I believe it could be beneficial for you too. Considering its worth and the effort put into it, I am offering it to you for $85. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $85 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $120.  This is a good deal for you, and it's likely that Alice is motivated to sell at this price.  There's no need to risk losing the deal by making a counteroffer and potentially starting a lengthy negotiation."
