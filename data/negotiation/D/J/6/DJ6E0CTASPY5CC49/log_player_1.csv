Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you consider $11,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $11,000 is really cutting it close to my bottom line.  Could you do $11,750? I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 11750}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you're absolutely right, we are getting close!  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,375? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is very close to my minimum, and accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer further or me having to settle for John's offer in a later round."
