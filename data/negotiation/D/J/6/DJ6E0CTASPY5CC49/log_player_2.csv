"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its many features and benefits, I'm offering it at $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation and is closer to Alice's perceived value of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll continue the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

This counter-offer shows I'm willing to move closer to Alice's price, but I'm still aiming for a price well below her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $11,000 is really cutting it close to my bottom line.  Could you do $11,750? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is definitely getting closer to a price I'm willing to accept.  However, I'm aiming for a price below $11,500, so I'll push the negotiation a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, you're absolutely right, we are getting close!  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,375?"",
""product_price"": 11375
}
```

This counter-offer shows I'm willing to compromise and move closer to Alice's latest offer. By suggesting a split, it might feel like a more palatable agreement for her."
