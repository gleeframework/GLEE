"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $11,000 is really cutting it close to my bottom line.  Could you do $11,750? I think that's a fair compromise.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're absolutely right, we are getting close!  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,375?",11375.0,Bob,6,
