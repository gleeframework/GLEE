"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $18,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $16,000.  This is a competitive price for a product of this caliber.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,000? This would be a fair compromise.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still looking for something a bit higher.  Would you be willing to do $14,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $14,500 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we settle at $13,500? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about purchasing.",13500.0,Bob,6,
