Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time. This reflects my maximum budget and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This offer represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this level.
