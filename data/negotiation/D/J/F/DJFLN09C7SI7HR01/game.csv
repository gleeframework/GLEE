"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1800000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time. This reflects my maximum budget and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $1000000 is below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I can recoup my investment. I'm counteroffering at $1400000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's value. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is my absolute maximum. This offer represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this level.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1200000, but I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1500000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
