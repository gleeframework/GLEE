Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $1000000 is below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I can recoup my investment. I'm counteroffering at $1400000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's value. What are your thoughts?

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, it's still above my comfortable range. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum.

Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this level."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1200000, but I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1500000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.

Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is still too high.  I'm at my absolute maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's better to buy from John at that price rather than continue to negotiate with Alice."
