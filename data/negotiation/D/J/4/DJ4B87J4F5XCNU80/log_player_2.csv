"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $15,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is the fair market value of this product. Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  this product has unique features and benefits that make it worth more than the standard market value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,500?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $17,500 is closer to his budget, he can still get the same product from John for $15,000. He should continue to negotiate with Alice to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,500 is still a bit too high for me. Given the market value and my budget, I'm willing to go up to $16,000.  This is a fair compromise that respects both our positions."", ""product_price"": 16000}
