"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $900,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both parties.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
