"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $60. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  I'll try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! This product looks great, but $60 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down a bit?"",
 ""product_price"": 40
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($40) to see how much wiggle room there is in the price. 
* **Polite and Open:** I want to keep the negotiation friendly and collaborative. I'm expressing interest in the product while clearly stating my price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $60 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, this product is truly valuable and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $55. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $55. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $55
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $55 is still a ways off from my ideal price. I'll make another counteroffer to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $47.50?"",
 ""product_price"": 47.50
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm suggesting a price that's exactly halfway between our last two offers. This shows I'm willing to compromise and find a fair deal. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By continuing to negotiate, I'm keeping the pressure on Alice to potentially lower the price further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell it to you for $52.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $52.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $52.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but we're still a bit far apart. I'm going to hold firm for now and see if I can get her closer to $50."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, I see we're getting closer.  How about $49 - it's a great price for this product, and we can both walk away happy?"",
 ""product_price"": 49
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase, Clear Target:** I'm nudging my offer up slightly to show willingness, but I'm sticking close to the $50 mark as my target.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By phrasing it as a ""walk away happy"" situation, I'm subtly reminding Alice that time is ticking on this negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not quite there, Bob. But I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell it to you for $51. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $51. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $51
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point of diminishing returns. Alice is clearly committed to staying above $50. While I could push further, the potential savings are getting smaller. Accepting at $51 secures a reasonable discount and avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down."
