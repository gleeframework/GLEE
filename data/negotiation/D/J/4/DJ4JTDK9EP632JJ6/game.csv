"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and I'm open to discussing this further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but your offer is significantly below the product's true market value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my eagerness to find a deal that works for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counter-offer.  I appreciate you coming down, but $1,900,000 is still much higher than I can manage.  Could you meet me somewhere closer to $800,000?  That would be a fair deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you being upfront about the product's value to you. I'm always willing to work towards a mutually beneficial deal. Considering that, I could be flexible and come down to $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but the gap between our prices is still too large. I'm serious about buying, but I need you to be more realistic.  Would you consider $900,000?  That's a significant move on my part.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground.  How about $1,400,000? This is a substantial compromise on my end, and it reflects my desire to close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my limit.  I'm offering $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to make a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand this is a significant investment for you, and I want to make this work.  My final offer is $1,250,000. This is a substantial compromise from my original position and reflects my strong desire to close this deal with you.",1250000.0,Alice,9,
