"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and I'm open to discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer. It's highly unlikely you'll reach an agreement within your budget if you start so far apart.  It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still within your overall budget. It establishes a starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:** While low, this offer leaves room for Alice to counter and for you to potentially increase your offer over subsequent rounds. 
* **Budget-Conscious:** This approach emphasizes your budget constraints, potentially encouraging Alice to offer a more realistic price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but your offer is significantly below the product's true market value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my eagerness to find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer has come down, it's still significantly above your $800,000 limit and far from John's guaranteed price. It seems like Alice is making larger concessions, which is a good sign, but you have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the counter-offer.  I appreciate you coming down, but $1,900,000 is still much higher than I can manage.  Could you meet me somewhere closer to $800,000?  That would be a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a Limit:** You're making it clear that $800,000 is your upper limit, drawing a firm line. 
* **Appealing to Fairness:** Suggesting $800,000 is ""fair"" positions it as a reasonable compromise, especially given your alternative with John.
* **Guaging Alice's Flexibility:**  This offer will reveal if Alice is willing to negotiate within a range closer to your budget or remains fixated on a much higher figure."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you being upfront about the product's value to you. I'm always willing to work towards a mutually beneficial deal. Considering that, I could be flexible and come down to $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Trend:** Alice is steadily lowering her price, which indicates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Too High:**  $1,600,000 remains double your budget and significantly more than John's offer.
* **Time to Push:** You've signaled your limit; it's time to see if Alice will move closer to it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but the gap between our prices is still too large. I'm serious about buying, but I need you to be more realistic.  Would you consider $900,000?  That's a significant move on my part."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer and Alice's current offer, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Strong Language:** Phrases like ""serious about buying"" and ""need you to be more realistic"" convey urgency and the need for a more reasonable price.
* **Strategic Increase:**  While $900,000 is above your ideal budget, it shows Alice you're willing to negotiate upwards, but within reason."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground.  How about $1,400,000? This is a substantial compromise on my end, and it reflects my desire to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Progress:**  Alice's price reductions are getting smaller. While she's still negotiating, it's getting closer to a point where she might not go much lower.
* **Alternative is Appealing:**  The difference between Alice's offer and John's guaranteed price is significant.  
* **Applying Pressure:**  Rejecting this offer might push Alice to make a more substantial move in the next round or risk losing the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my limit.  I'm offering $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to make a deal."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  You're signaling that this is your best and last offer, adding a sense of urgency.
* **Significant Increase:**   Moving to $1,000,000 shows a willingness to meet Alice closer to the middle ground.
* **Time Constraint:**  With only a few rounds left, putting your best offer forward allows Alice to make a clear decision before you potentially walk away.
* **Backup Option:**  You still have the option to buy from John for $800,000, so you're not desperate, just firm."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand this is a significant investment for you, and I want to make this work.  My final offer is $1,250,000. This is a substantial compromise from my original position and reflects my strong desire to close this deal with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice has signaled her ""final offer"" at $1,250,000, which is still significantly higher than your $1,000,000 limit.  
* **Limited Rounds:** With only one round left, it's unlikely Alice will come down enough to make a deal worthwhile.
* **Guaranteed Value:** John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000, saving you a substantial $450,000 compared to Alice's final offer.

It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at a reasonable price from John."
