"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer in its industry and has tremendous potential for growth. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with a price of $2000000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of $1800000. This is my best price, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1800000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about the product's value and my own needs. I'm thinking of $1700000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement here.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $1700000 is still above my target. I'm willing to make a significant offer, so I'm counteroffering $1450000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a significant offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm starting to think we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I need to consider the product's value and my own needs. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about the long-term benefits of the sale. I'm thinking of $1600000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement here.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $1600000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to make one final push, so I'm counteroffering $1550000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",1550000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're making a final push, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've made significant concessions, and I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a point where it's not worth continuing the negotiation. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm thinking of $1625000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to a deal here.",1625000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but I'm afraid I've reached my maximum budget. I'm willing to make a final offer of $1550000, and that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $800000.",1550000.0,Bob,10,
