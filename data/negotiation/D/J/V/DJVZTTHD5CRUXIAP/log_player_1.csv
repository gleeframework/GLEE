Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you're still getting a profit and haven't given away too much.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Remember, the key is to be assertive but also open to finding a compromise. This will help you maximize your chances of getting the best possible price for your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $1,300,000 for your product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum than his initial rejection, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and attempt to close the gap further.  

It's important to note that selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option, but it's worth trying to get closer to that price with Bob first.  

In the next round, you should counter with a price between $1,300,000 and $1,400,000. This shows you are willing to compromise while still aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a little more to make this deal work. How about $1,350,000? It's still a great price for you and closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:** You've moved closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating your desire to reach an agreement.
* **Maintains your position:**  $1,350,000 is still above Bob's initial offer and closer to your desired price.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation open for a potential final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to consider $1,325,000 as a compromise. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. I hope you can accept this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $1,300,000. While you could try to counteroffer again and aim for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer of $1,500,000 is significant. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures you secure a sale and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation.  This outcome is a good compromise and allows you to move forward."
