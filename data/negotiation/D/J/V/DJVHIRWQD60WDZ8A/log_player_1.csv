Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $2,200,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay. Given my budget and the value I see in the product, I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential of the product and my willingness to close this deal quickly. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Bob's offer:

This represents a significant move from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his latest offer is still significantly less than John's standing offer. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the $100,000 gap in a way that makes staying in the negotiation worthwhile.  It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale with John."
