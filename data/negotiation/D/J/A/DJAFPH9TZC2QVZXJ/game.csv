"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe is worth a lot to the right person. I'm open to negotiating a fair price, but I'm looking for at least $18000 for it.  Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $12000. Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget.  While $12000 is a bit below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we split the difference and meet at $15000? This would give us both a fair deal, and I can still ensure I get a decent return on my investment. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $15000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $13500?  This would be a good compromise for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
