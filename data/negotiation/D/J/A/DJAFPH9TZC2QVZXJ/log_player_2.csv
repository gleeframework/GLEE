Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget.  While $12000 is a bit below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we split the difference and meet at $15000? This would give us both a fair deal, and I can still ensure I get a decent return on my investment. What do you think?
