Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm offering it to you at a price of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing a price higher than John's offer.
* **Create Urgency:** Highlighting the product's value and the fact that this is a special offer for Bob might encourage him to accept before considering other options.

By offering the product at $9,500, Alice leaves a small margin for potential negotiation while aiming to secure a price significantly higher than her fallback option of selling to John."
