"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $80 simply wouldn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  I'm confident this is still a fair price for a product that's worth a lot to you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we compromise at $88? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement.",88.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $88 is a bit too high. Would you be willing to meet me at $82?",82.0,Bob,6,
