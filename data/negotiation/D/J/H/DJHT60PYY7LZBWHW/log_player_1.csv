"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $1,800,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value without being aggressive. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By aiming high initially, I position myself to potentially secure a deal closer to my desired price, even if it takes a few rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my walk-away price. I'm willing to negotiate further since I have time and John's offer acts as a safety net. I'll aim for a counteroffer that bridges the gap and keeps Bob engaged."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the market value, but this product offers some unique advantages that I believe justify a higher price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This feels like a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** I'm acknowledging Bob's perspective and willingness to negotiate to maintain a positive atmosphere. 
* **Value Justification:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's unique benefits to support the higher price.
* **Significant Drop:** My counteroffer is a substantial decrease from my initial offer, showing Bob that I'm serious about finding a middle ground.
* **Strategic Positioning:** I'm still aiming above my minimum, leaving room for further negotiation if Bob counters again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,650,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and show that I'm serious about making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches my minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer.  While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee Bob would agree, and I risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer guarantees I achieve my goal of selling the product for at least $1,500,000."
