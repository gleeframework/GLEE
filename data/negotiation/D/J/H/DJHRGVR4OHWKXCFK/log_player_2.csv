"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's much too early to buy from Alice or John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to see how low Alice is willing to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 2500} 
```

I'm starting low to see how serious Alice is about selling.  $2500 is a significant discount from her initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is coming down, but $4,000 is still too high. I want to see if I can get her closer to my initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3000} 
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm serious about buying, but still keeping it below $3,500 to see if Alice will budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $3,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $3,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice is getting closer to my desired price. While I could try to get her to go lower, there's a good chance she won't budge, and I risk losing a good deal by continuing to negotiate. $3,500 is a significant discount from John's price, and I'm confident I can get a good deal for myself."
