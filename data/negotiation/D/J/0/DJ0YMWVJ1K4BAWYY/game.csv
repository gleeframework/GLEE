"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $12000 is a bit steep for me. Considering the price I'm willing to pay, I'd offer you $9500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $11000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $10500, which is the absolute most I can do. Let's see if we can make this work.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! I understand that $10500 is a significant offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $11200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11200.0,Alice,5,
