"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. Can you consider it?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the value of the product. How about $950,000? It's a fair price that balances our needs.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $920,000. Can you consider it?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $920,000 is still a bit too low, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $935,000? This would allow us both to walk away satisfied.",935000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're very close to an agreement. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm only able to go down to $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's finalize this deal!",925000.0,Alice,7,
