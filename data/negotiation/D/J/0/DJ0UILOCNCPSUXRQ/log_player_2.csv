"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it would be highly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $1,000,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product would be valuable, but $1,000,000 is too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price and my own maximum budget. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Positive:** The message aims to maintain a good relationship with Alice while clearly stating my position.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This initial offer will help me gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I believe this product is worth a significant amount, I'm willing to come down a bit. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet somewhere closer to $700,000?"", 
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Movement:**  I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Targeting a Middle Ground:**  $700,000 represents a price point closer to the middle ground between our initial offers.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  By suggesting a price closer to John's offer, I'm subtly reminding Alice that I have other options."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, but I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about $850,000? This feels like a fair price that reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

""message"": ""Alice, you're right, finding a middle ground is important.  How about we settle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while working for me."", 
""product_price"": 775000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm suggesting a price that splits the difference between her last offer ($850,000) and my previous offer ($700,000).  This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Final Offer (almost):**  While I'm open to a slight adjustment, I'm signaling that I'm getting close to my limit. I'm only $25,000 away from John's price now.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone is important to encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's make this final offer: $812,500. It splits the difference and represents a significant but fair discount for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and I'm not willing to pay significantly more than John's offer. 
* **Minimal Savings:**  Even if I could negotiate Alice down a bit further, the potential savings are now minimal compared to John's price of $800,000.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of her offer increasing or me losing the opportunity to buy from John."
