"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $500000 is a bit outside my budget at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, which reflects its value to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your perspective and would like to present an alternative solution that might better align with your current budget. Considering the unique value and benefits this product offers, I am proposing a price of $350000.
