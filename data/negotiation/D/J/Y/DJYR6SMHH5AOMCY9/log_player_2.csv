"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for a product that's worth $10,000 to you! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a good price, it's still above Alice's value of $8,000. There's room for negotiation to try and get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great price for a product worth $10,000 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible. While $9,000 is closer to his target price, it's still above Alice's value of $8,000. There's likely room for a little more negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer, potentially finding a price both sides are happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,750?  This would be a good price for both of us and allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to go down to $8,900, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $8,900 is below Bob's maximum price of $10,000.
* **Significant savings:** Accepting this offer means Bob saves $1,100 compared to buying from John.
* **Reaching a compromise:**  While Bob might have hoped for a lower price,  Alice has moved closer to his desired price. Accepting this offer represents a reasonable compromise.
* **Risk of going further:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to Alice rejecting further offers, and Bob might end up having to buy from John at a higher price.  

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk a higher price later."
