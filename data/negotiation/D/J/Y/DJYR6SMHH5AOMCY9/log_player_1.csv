"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still lower than my minimum desired price of $8,000.  I'll see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great price for a product worth $10,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price of $8,000.  I'm willing to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement, but if it doesn't work, I'll go with John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
