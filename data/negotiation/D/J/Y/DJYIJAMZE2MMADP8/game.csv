"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price that gives you a good value and allows me to make a profit. Let's meet in the middle on this one.",13000.0,Alice,3,
