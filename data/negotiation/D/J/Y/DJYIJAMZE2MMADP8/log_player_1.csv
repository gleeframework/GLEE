Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so offering it at $14,000 gives him some room to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you're making a profit, but also leaves room for negotiation if Bob isn't willing to pay that much.
* **It signals your willingness to deal:**  A lower starting price can make Bob feel like you're trying to reach a deal, increasing his likelihood of engaging in negotiation.

Remember, the key is to be flexible and willing to negotiate while still protecting your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $11,500, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  You can potentially get more by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price that gives you a good value and allows me to make a profit. Let's meet in the middle on this one."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While it's tempting to continue negotiating, Bob's offers are steadily declining and are still too low for your minimum price.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John rather than risk getting an even lower offer from Bob."
