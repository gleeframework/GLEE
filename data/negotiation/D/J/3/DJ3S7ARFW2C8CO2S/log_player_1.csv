"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth more than that to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like I'm open to a deal.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product for Bob. 
* **Room for Compromise:** By starting at $10,000, I have some flexibility to negotiate down if needed. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to secure a price as close to my minimum ($12,000) as possible. I'll use the remaining rounds to gauge Bob's interest and see if I can push for a higher price. However, if the negotiation drags on or I feel like I'm not getting close to my desired price, I'll be ready to move on to John and secure the $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to buy the product for $8,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $12,000. While it's tempting to take the quick win, I'm still confident I can get a better price.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum but still acknowledge Bob's budget. I'll try to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us. 

If the negotiations don't get me closer to my desired price, I'll be prepared to sell to John in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  This allows us both to get a good deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Middle Ground:** I'm proposing $9,250, which is the midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Language:** I use positive language (""good deal,"" ""split the difference"") to maintain a friendly and collaborative tone. 
* **Emphasis on Fair Deal:** I highlight that this price is fair for both of us, making it more appealing.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a price that both satisfies my minimum requirement and is still attractive enough for Bob to consider. By offering a compromise, I'm hoping to avoid a stalemate and make progress towards a deal. If Bob still rejects my offer, I'll be ready to adjust my price further in the next round or consider selling to John if the situation warrants it."
