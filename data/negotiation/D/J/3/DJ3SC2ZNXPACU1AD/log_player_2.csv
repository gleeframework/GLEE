"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although Alice's offer is below Bob's maximum budget, he can potentially get a better deal by negotiating. There's a $400,000 difference between Alice's offer and Bob's maximum willingness to pay, making further negotiation worthwhile."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it is lower than her initial offer, it's still $300,000 higher than his ideal price. He can potentially negotiate further and get a better price. There's still room for a compromise, so it's worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,280,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. At this point, Alice is offering $1,280,000, which is still $280,000 higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000, it's a better deal for Bob. There's a high chance that further negotiation with Alice might not lead to a better price, and it's not worth the risk of potentially losing the product to another buyer."
