"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This price would still allow you to make a good profit, and I'd be happy to close the deal at that price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
