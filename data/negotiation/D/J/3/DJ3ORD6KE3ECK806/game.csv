"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $10,000. I believe it's a fair deal, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $8,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you'll get from the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
