Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you!  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$18,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than my minimum value of $12,000, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and inviting, emphasizing the value of the product without revealing too much.  It also leaves the door open for counteroffers.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a relatively high price, I aim to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good deal. If Bob rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counteroffer or simply move on to John's offer if it's a better option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle immediately. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $18,000. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price that is still higher than his offer but lower than my initial asking price. This strategy allows for a more balanced negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $12,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to compromise a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle on $15,000?  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $15,000, which is the midpoint between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes a desire to reach a mutually agreeable price. It suggests that we can find a ""win-win"" solution.

**Strategy:**

By offering a compromise and highlighting the potential benefits for both of us, I hope to encourage Bob to accept the counteroffer. If he rejects again, I can then further adjust my offer or move on to selling to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $15000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $13000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Since the negotiation has already taken some time, I am willing to accept this offer to avoid potentially further rounds of counteroffers and potentially losing the deal to John."
