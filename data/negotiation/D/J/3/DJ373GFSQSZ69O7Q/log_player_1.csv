"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a more reasonable price. How about $1,200,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I have more rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering our previous discussions, I propose a price of $1,450,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but $1,450,000 is still below my ideal price point. I'm only two rounds away from selling to John, which would guarantee me $1,500,000. There's still a chance Bob will come up, and I'm willing to risk it for an extra $50,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, I still need to be closer to $1,500,000 to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to drop to $1,475,000. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement in the next few rounds."", ""product_price"": 1475000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I think we can find a middle ground. I propose a price of $1,425,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now down to the final four rounds of negotiation. While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is more than what Bob is currently offering. There's a good chance that Bob will come up with a counteroffer, but I'm not willing to risk it. It's better to secure a safe deal now."
