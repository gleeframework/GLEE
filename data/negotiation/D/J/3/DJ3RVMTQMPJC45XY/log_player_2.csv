"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is offering $95. It makes sense to reject the offer and see if you can get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $87.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 87}
```"

Round 5

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm really trying to stay within my budget of $80. How about $85?  That's a fair compromise and will let us both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 85}
