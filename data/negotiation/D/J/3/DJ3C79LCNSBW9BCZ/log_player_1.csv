I'm starting with an offer of $1,700,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product.  However, I'm leaving room for negotiation if he counters with a lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to accept that. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering with a price of $1,600,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a bit closer to Bob's offer, hopefully making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,520,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,520,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,520,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and above what John is offering. It's a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept it to secure the sale."
