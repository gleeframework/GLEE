Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than I'm willing to pay. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.

Alice is not willing to go lower than $1,050,000, and I'm not willing to go higher than $950,000.  We're at an impasse.  At this point, it's more cost-effective to buy from John for $800,000."
