{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$500,000 is a great price, but there's room for negotiation.  It's worth trying to get a better deal before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $300,000 is significantly lower than her initial offer, but it's still within my budget. If Alice rejects this offer, we can continue to negotiate."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $400,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, I'm still hoping to get it lower. I'm going to continue negotiating in the hope that I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price below Alice's current offer. This keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining a price that is beneficial to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to my ideal price, but I still believe there is room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue trying to secure a lower price without risking buying the product for a higher amount than I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but still keeping it lower than Alice's current offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but am still seeking a good deal. This middle ground hopefully encourages Alice to accept the offer. If she doesn't, I'll continue to adjust my offer based on her responses, keeping in mind the 10-round limit and the possibility of buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has reverted back to her initial offer.  While tempting, I'm not willing to give up the potential for a better deal.  I'll continue negotiating, keeping in mind that I have limited rounds remaining and the alternative option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 425000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but still keeping it lower than Alice's current offer. I'm getting closer to her price point, but I'm also acknowledging that I'm nearing the end of our negotiation.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll have only two rounds left to secure a deal and might have to consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's price is getting too high.  I'm running out of rounds, and the risk of not being able to get a lower price from Alice is too high.  It's better to secure the product from John at this point, even at a higher price, to guarantee I get the product."
