Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product at a price of $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could greatly benefit you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $10,000, but that doesn't directly influence your initial offer. You should aim higher.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a higher price ($19,000) sets an anchor. Even if Bob doesn't accept this price, it makes subsequent offers in the negotiation seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $19,000 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down.  You can always decrease the price during the negotiation if needed, moving closer to his $10,000 valuation while staying above your minimum of $15,000.
* **Backup Offer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, ensuring you won't go below your minimum.

**Important:** This is just the opening move. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and potential counter-offers."
