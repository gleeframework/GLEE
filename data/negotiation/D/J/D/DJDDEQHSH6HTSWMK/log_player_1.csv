Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,500.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this."", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value exceeds Bob's perceived value, justifying the higher price. 
* **Openness:** By stating you're ""open to hearing thoughts,"" you encourage negotiation and make Bob feel more comfortable counter-offering. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is very price-sensitive, you might slightly lower your initial offer.
* **Market Demand:** If the product is in high demand, you can be firmer with your pricing."
