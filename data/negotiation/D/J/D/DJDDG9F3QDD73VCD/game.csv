"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and am open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer,  $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. Given my valuation of the product, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to move down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000, which represents a significant investment and a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement here.",900000.0,Bob,4,
