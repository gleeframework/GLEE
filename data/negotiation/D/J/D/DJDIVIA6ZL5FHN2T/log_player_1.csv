This offer gives you a decent profit margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob. It leaves room for negotiation, but also establishes a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $800,000 is a significant sum, it's below my minimum acceptable value. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, aiming to reach a compromise closer to my goal."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?  That's a strong offer and shows I'm serious about closing this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a more favorable outcome. It's better to sell to John and secure my minimum desired price."
