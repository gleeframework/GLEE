Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're ensuring you make a profit of at least $2,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob has a clear incentive to buy, as he'll save $2,000. 

This gives you the best chance of closing a deal with Bob while still getting a good price.  If he rejects, you can always fall back on John's offer."
