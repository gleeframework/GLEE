# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,100,000. I'm confident that you'll find it a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're looking to save as much money as possible.  $1,100,000 is still a pretty high price, so it's worth negotiating further.  Let's see if Alice will come down."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm happy to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for my comfort. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the value the product holds for you.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has moved closer to your price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high. Let's see if we can get them down a little further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still aiming for a bit lower, though. How about $1,025,000? It's a good compromise, and we can both get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. My counteroffer is $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're getting closer!  $1,075,000 is still higher than your ideal price, but it's worth seeing if we can get Alice to budge a bit more before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,075,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can meet in the middle.  How about $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I'll meet you at $1,062,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to a price that is just a little higher than your last offer.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely they're not going to budge much more.  At this point, it's more important to secure the product than to save an extra $12,500.  It's a good deal, and you're still saving a significant amount compared to John's price."
