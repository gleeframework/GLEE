"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm happy to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for my comfort. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the value the product holds for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still aiming for a bit lower, though. How about $1,025,000? It's a good compromise, and we can both get this deal done.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. My counteroffer is $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from here.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,075,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can meet in the middle.  How about $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I'll meet you at $1,062,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1062500.0,Alice,7,
