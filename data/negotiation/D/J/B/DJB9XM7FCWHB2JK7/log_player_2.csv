Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate the effort you're putting into finding a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price you're offering. I'm willing to meet you at $750,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While we could try to negotiate further, Alice has indicated this is her lowest price.  At $750,000, we're saving a significant amount compared to John's offer ($1,200,000) and are well below our $1,200,000 maximum. It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal from Alice at this point."
