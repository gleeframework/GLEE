Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  You still have some wiggle room to accept a counteroffer if necessary.
* **It's a reasonable price:**  It's not too aggressive, allowing for a more amicable negotiation. 

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $120. I'm not desperate to sell, and John is a guaranteed buyer at a higher price.  

I'll counter Bob's offer, aiming to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer Justification:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low for me. However, I want to keep the negotiation going, so I'm proposing a counter-offer that's still favorable to Bob but closer to my desired price.
* **Compromise:** I'm suggesting a price that is exactly halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging further negotiation."
