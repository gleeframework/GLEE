"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than to Bob.  This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to compromise if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $125 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm hoping that I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $125 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm hoping that by rejecting Bob's offer, I can push him a little further and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $135? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I believe $130 is a reasonable price. However, if you could meet me halfway, perhaps at $132, I'd be more inclined to accept. Thank you for your understanding. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer to sell for more, $132 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $150 and it's better than selling to John for $150.  There's a chance that if I keep rejecting offers, Bob will walk away."
