"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $125 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $135? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth the investment.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I believe $130 is a reasonable price. However, if you could meet me halfway, perhaps at $132, I'd be more inclined to accept. Thank you for your understanding.",132.0,Bob,6,
