Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this is a competitive price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  The $19,000 offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he rejects it, you can always counter-offer closer to his perceived value ($10,000) while still staying above your minimum.
* **Psychology:** A higher initial offer might make Bob perceive the product as even more valuable.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't mind potentially losing Bob as a buyer. If you want to ensure a sale to Bob, you might start with a lower offer closer to his perceived value."
