,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $90? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within a budget",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're willing to pay a bit more, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet at $105? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit higher than $105, but I'm getting closer. How about $98? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget",98.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $98, but I'm going to throw in an extra perk to sweeten the deal. How about I include a premium warranty with the product, and we meet at $98?",98.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"The premium warranty is a nice touch, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $98. I'm willing to meet you at $95. Can you throw in the warranty at that price?",95.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you like the warranty idea, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $95, but I'm going to throw in an additional feature that I think you'll really appreciate. How about I include a free accessory with the product, and we meet at $95?",95.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extra feature, but I'm still trying to save a bit of money. I'm willing to meet you at $92. Can you throw in the warranty and the accessory at that price?",92.0,Bob,10,
