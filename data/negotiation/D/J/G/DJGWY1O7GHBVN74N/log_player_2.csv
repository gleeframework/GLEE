"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to get a lower price.  You have room to negotiate since you're willing to pay up to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $900,000 is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in the product but my budget is closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $800,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

``` 

Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise and is within your budget.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might walk away and you'd have to buy from John for a higher price."
