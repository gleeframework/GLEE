"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is lower than your maximum budget of $12,000 and higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This means there's a range where both parties can benefit from the transaction. Accepting the offer allows you to buy the product at a lower price than buying from John."
