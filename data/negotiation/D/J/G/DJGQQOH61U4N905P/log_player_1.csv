"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $2,000,000, significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially earn a good profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the product's uniqueness and value to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I invite Bob to share his thoughts, indicating I'm open to negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** Based on Bob's response, I will adjust my strategy for the following rounds. If Bob counters low, I'll have to decide whether to accept or counter with a lower price.
* **John's Offer:** If Bob is too difficult to deal with or I feel like I won't get a good price, I'll switch to John, who offers my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower:**  $800,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Bob is interested and has expressed willingness to negotiate.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:** While John's offer is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell. I'll explore if I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter-offer:** I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but lower than the original $2,000,000. I need to find a balance between getting a reasonable price and not scaring Bob away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $800,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to consider a compromise. How about $1,700,000? It's still a good deal for you, considering the unique value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counter-offer is $1,700,000, which is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility while maintaining a good profit margin.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the product's unique value, reminding Bob of its potential worth.
* **Open Dialogue:** I ask for Bob's thoughts, indicating I'm open to further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's next response. If he counters too low again, I may consider selling to John. However, I want to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $1300000? Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation is still possible:** Bob is showing interest and a willingness to meet halfway, indicating potential for a deal.
* **John is a backup option:**  I'm not in a rush to sell and can afford to keep negotiating.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $1,300,000 is still a bit below my desired range, I'm willing to compromise further. Let's meet at $1,450,000. This reflects the unique value of this product while acknowledging your financial constraints. I'm open to a quick final negotiation if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

* **Emphasis on Value:**  I once again emphasize the product's unique value to justify the price.
* **Urgency:**  I introduce a sense of urgency by mentioning a ""final negotiation"" to encourage Bob to make a decision. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll evaluate Bob's response carefully. If he counters again, I'll need to decide whether to accept, make another counter-offer, or sell to John. 
* **Selling to John:** I'm still holding out for a better price from Bob, but I won't hesitate to switch to John if I feel the negotiations are stalling or Bob isn't serious."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1450000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1300000, but that's as high as I can go. Is there any flexibility on your end? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We've been going back and forth with minimal movement. Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Limited Time:** With only 4 rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to reach a more favorable price.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum, and it's a secure deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Selling to John:** I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure I receive my minimum acceptable price. It's the most secure option considering the limited time and Bob's unwillingness to budge significantly."
