"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your price of $950,000. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I believe the product will bring me. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your initial offer is appealing, the product's value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000.  I believe this price point reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",900000.0,Alice,3,
