"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,300,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significant, and $1,100,000 falls quite a bit short of what I believe is fair. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget, I cannot exceed $1,150,000. I hope this proposal meets somewhere in the middle.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
