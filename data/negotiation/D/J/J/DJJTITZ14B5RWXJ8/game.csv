"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  However, $70 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Could you meet me halfway at $85?",85.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit far from $85. How about we meet at $75? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get as close to my target as possible.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Tell you what, let's split the difference again and call it $80.  That's my final offer.",80.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $80 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $78, that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",78.0,Bob,6,
