"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $9,000. I'd be willing to consider $7,500 for the product. It's a great deal for me, but I think it's a bit more reasonable for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise.  However, $7,500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?  That way, we both get a fair price.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,100? It's a great price for me, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",8100.0,Bob,4,
