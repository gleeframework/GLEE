"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $650,000? That feels like a fair deal.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers, so I'm going to counter with $750,000. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $750,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would you consider $710,000? I think that's a competitive offer.",710000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $725,000, which is a slight compromise from my original offer. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident you'll love it.",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very patient, and I respect your position.  How about we split the difference at $717,500?  I'm hoping we can close this soon.",717500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $722,500, which is a slight adjustment from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident you'll love it.",722500.0,Alice,7,
