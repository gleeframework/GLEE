"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. My initial offer is $1400000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested, but  $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** Bob starts with a lower offer than Alice's, demonstrating his intent to negotiate.  
* **Leaving room for compromise:** $1,100,000 is a significant jump from Bob's ideal price, but it's still below his absolute limit and allows for potential negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** The message expresses interest, keeping the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly unique and holds significant value.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to stay closer to my desired price. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:** $1,250,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for better deal:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, so there's a chance for a more favorable offer in the future.  
* **No immediate pressure:** Bob has 10 rounds, so there's no need to rush into a deal that's still too high."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,250,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1150000 is still not feasible for me. This product is worth a lot more than that, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to go down to $1200000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.
