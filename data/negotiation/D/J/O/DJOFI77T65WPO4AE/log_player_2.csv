"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, valued at $120 to me, for a price of $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

While Alice's offer of $110 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John. Your goal is to save as much money as possible, so buying from John is the best option."
