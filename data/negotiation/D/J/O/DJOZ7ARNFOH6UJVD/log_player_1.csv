Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It shows Bob that you are serious about selling the product, but you are also aware of its value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the $9,500 you initially offered. You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Bob's. It shows Bob that you are willing to negotiate, but you still believe the product is worth more than $8,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now too low, and there's no guarantee he'll budge further. Selling to John guarantees you $8,000, which is close to your minimum price, and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
