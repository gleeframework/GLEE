"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider lowering the price to $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about $7,250? ",7250.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $8,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
