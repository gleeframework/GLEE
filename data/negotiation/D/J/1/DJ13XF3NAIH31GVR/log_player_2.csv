"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's definitely not worth it to buy the product from Alice for $17,000 when you can get it from John for $12,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This is the lowest price you're willing to pay, so you're putting the ball in Alice's court. It's a bold move, but if Alice is motivated to sell, she might accept."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,000 is closer to your target, it's still above your maximum value. There's room for negotiation, and you have rounds to spare. Let's see if we can push Alice down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4

{""product_price"": 13000}
```

You're increasing your offer slightly, showing willingness to compromise. This could encourage Alice to meet you halfway, especially since she's already rejected a lower offer."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,500 is tempting, it's still above your maximum value.  You've shown you're serious about negotiating and Alice is clearly willing to budge.  Let's see if we can get closer to your target price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

You're inching closer to your target price. This counteroffer shows Alice that you're willing to increase your offer, but you're also holding firm to your limits. The pressure is now on Alice to decide if she wants to close the deal or risk losing it."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is closer to your target than John's price, you're only 3 rounds away from being able to purchase from John. It's worth trying to get Alice down to your desired price or even slightly above it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13750}

You're almost there! This counteroffer is a compromise, but it's still within your budget and shows Alice you're serious about getting a deal done. The pressure is on Alice - does she want to make a quick deal or risk losing the sale entirely?"
