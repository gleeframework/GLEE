# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm extending this opportunity to purchase it for $115. I understand its worth to you is $120, so I hope this offer aligns with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer

While Alice's offer of $115 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or simply proceed to buy from John and save $5."
