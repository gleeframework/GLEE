"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you valuing the product at $120. While I'm interested, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment. I'd be happy to offer $80 for the product. ",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position, and I respect your valuation of the product. To find a middle ground, I would like to counteroffer at $100 for the product. This still allows us to work together while ensuring a fair price for me.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $100 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
