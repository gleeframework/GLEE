"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  How about $140?",140.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got some costs associated with this product, so I can do $160. It's a bit of a compromise, but I think you'll find it's worth it.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $160 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $150. This is my final offer.",150.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're willing to go up to $150, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there. I can do $155, and that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself.",155.0,Alice,5,
