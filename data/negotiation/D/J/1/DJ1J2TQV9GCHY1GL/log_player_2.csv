# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $119. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $119 is close to your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $100 from John. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to move forward and secure the best possible price."
