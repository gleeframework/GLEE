Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $119."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above your minimum ($120).
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially increasing your profit slightly.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob declines."
