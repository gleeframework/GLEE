{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you're likely to see."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value specifically to Bob, making the price more palatable. 
* **Alternative Exists:** While not explicitly stated, the fact that you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 gives you leverage. Bob might be willing to pay a premium to avoid missing out."
