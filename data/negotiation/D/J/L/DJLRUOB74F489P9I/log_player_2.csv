""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is way above my budget. This product would need to be significantly lower for me to consider it. How about $6,000?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $6,000 significantly undervalues the product.  I could consider coming down to $11,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's true worth.
