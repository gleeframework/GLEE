"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and features, I believe a starting price of $13,000 is fair. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is way above my budget. This product would need to be significantly lower for me to consider it. How about $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $6,000 significantly undervalues the product.  I could consider coming down to $11,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's true worth.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However,  $11,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
