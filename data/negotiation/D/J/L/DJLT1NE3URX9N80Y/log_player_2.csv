"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,250,000 is far beyond my budget.  Given my maximum budget of $1,000,000, I'd be willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This would still be a good profit for you, and I believe it's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true worth and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the unique nature of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still too high. While she's coming down, we can try to get a better deal.  Let's counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a considerable amount and reflects the unique nature of the product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
