"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This leaves room for negotiation and makes any subsequent offers from you seem more reasonable in comparison. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  This initial offer helps gauge Bob's level of interest and provides insights into his negotiation style. His response will reveal how much he values the product and how flexible he might be. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keeping John's offer in mind ($1,500,000) gives you a strong fallback position. You're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,250,000 is far beyond my budget.  Given my maximum budget of $1,000,000, I'd be willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This would still be a good profit for you, and I believe it's a reasonable starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. While he's shown some flexibility, you have plenty of room to negotiate and John's offer gives you leverage.  It's too early to accept such a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true worth and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the unique nature of what I'm offering."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** While still above Bob's offer, this counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate. The drop is substantial enough to encourage Bob but not so much that you give away your leverage.
* **Reiterating Value:** Reminding Bob about the product's unique value helps justify the higher price and keeps his focus on potential benefits rather than just the initial cost.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  You're aiming to slowly bring Bob closer to your desired range, keeping in mind your alternative offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a considerable amount and reflects the unique nature of the product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might reduce his offer or walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
