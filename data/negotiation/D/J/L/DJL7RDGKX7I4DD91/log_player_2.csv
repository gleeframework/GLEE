{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is a good price, but there are still 9 rounds left.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the unique value of this product. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. Considering your interest, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $11500. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, it's still more than his target.  There's still room for negotiation, and he has more rounds to try."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,500 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're getting closer to your comfort zone, but I still think this product is worth more than $11000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'll sell it to you for $11750. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to negotiate a lower price. Although Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's comfort zone, there are still 5 rounds left to try and get a better price.  There is still room for Alice to come down to $11,000, which is Bob's current target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $11,750 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $11,250. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11250}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're making a significant compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $11250. I'll make one more counteroffer, and if you're willing to meet me at $11500, I'll consider it. This is the lowest price I can accept without losing money on the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:**  Bob only has 3 rounds left.  There's a risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Slight Compromise:**  $11,500 is a little more than Bob's last counteroffer, but it's still within his budget and significantly lower than Alice's original price.
* **Alice's Firmness:**  Alice is clearly not willing to go lower.  It's likely that further negotiation will just lead to a stalemate. 

While Bob might be able to get a slightly lower price, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether. Accepting the offer secures the product at a decent price within his budget."
