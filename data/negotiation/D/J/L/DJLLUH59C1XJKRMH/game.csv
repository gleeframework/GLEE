"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $85 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $78 for the product. I'm getting close to my limit, but I really want to make a deal with you. Can you consider this offer?",78.0,Bob,4,
