"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $11,500 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it, which would be a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really looking to stay within my budget of $10,000, and I'm wondering if we can find a way to bridge that gap.  Could you consider $10,750 as a final offer?  It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'd be happy to close the deal today.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",11250.0,Alice,5,
