Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $1,450,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,500,000, but it still leaves a healthy margin for me.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept this offer. If he rejects it, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I'm always willing to walk away and sell to John for my full asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to sell for that low, even though it would be better than nothing. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,200,000. This is a significant concession, but it's still a price that gives me a decent profit.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize that this is a fair offer and accept it. If he rejects it again, I'll need to reconsider my options, as I'm not willing to go much lower."
