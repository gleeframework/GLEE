"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,450,000 is a good deal, it's still above your target of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. You can potentially get a better deal, or at least gauge how flexible she is."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum price, hoping Alice is willing to meet me there. This is a significant drop from her initial offer, but it's a good starting point for the negotiation. If she rejects this, we'll know she's not willing to come down that much, and we can adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is within my acceptable range, and it's a significant drop from her initial offer. While I could continue negotiating, there's a chance she'll reject my counteroffer again, potentially leading to a stalemate. It's safer to accept this offer and secure the product at a price that's still favorable for me."
