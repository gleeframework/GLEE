"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  Based on its potential value to you, I'm asking for $1400000. This price reflects a significant opportunity for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a lower price than John's offer, there's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal.  Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,500,000, he can afford to counter-offer and see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This price reflects a significant saving for you compared to John's offer, and would still give you a healthy profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $1300000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1350000? This is a fair price that still leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $1,400,000, and it's still within Bob's budget.  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, accepting this offer minimizes the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially losing the deal."
