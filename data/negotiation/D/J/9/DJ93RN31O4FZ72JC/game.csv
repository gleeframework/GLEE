"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. This price reflects a significant saving for you compared to John's offer, and would still give you a healthy profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $1300000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1350000? This is a fair price that still leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let's find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
