"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  It's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,200, but that's as high as I can go.",12200.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $12,300. This is a great price for a product you'll be happy with for a long time.",12300.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,300 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,200, as I mentioned before, and I'm hoping we can meet at that price. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make a deal.",12200.0,Bob,6,
