"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to me. This unique item is worth $1,000,000 to you, and I am excited to extend this offer to you at a price that reflects its true worth while allowing us both to benefit. I propose to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This price not only ensures a fair transaction but also allows for a reasonable profit margin for me. I believe this offer strikes a balance between value and affordability, making it an attractive proposition for both parties. I look forward to your consideration of this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product.  Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is higher than your maximum.  You can get the product from John for your maximum price, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best choice."
