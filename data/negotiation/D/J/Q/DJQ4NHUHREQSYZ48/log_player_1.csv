Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $12,000. I believe it offers significant value, even above its market price."", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price higher than both my minimum ($10,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value"" over ""market price,"" I'm framing the negotiation around the product's benefits rather than just the number. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize potential profit:**  There's a chance Bob might accept a higher price.
2. **Establish a strong bargaining position:** Even if he counters, I'm starting from a point of strength. 
3. **Maintain the option of John:**  I can always walk away and sell to John for my minimum if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. I believe it's a good price considering its market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm better off negotiating further or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, and I understand your perspective on the market value.  However, the value of this product goes beyond standard market comparisons. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500."", ""product_price"": 10500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** By coming down $1,500, I'm signaling flexibility while still aiming for a price above my minimum. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** This tactic can be psychologically effective, framing the negotiation as a fair compromise. 
* **Holding Firm:** I'm not yet willing to go below my minimum of $10,000, especially since I have John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value and the market price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but he's still significantly below my $10,000 minimum. It seems unlikely he'll reach a price I find acceptable.  At this point, continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of losing the guaranteed $10,000 offer from John."
