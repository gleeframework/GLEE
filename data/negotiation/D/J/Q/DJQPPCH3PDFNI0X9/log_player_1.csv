Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm starting to run out of time, $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round with a price closer to my desired amount."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $9500 is simply not going to work for me. Let's split the difference and go with $10,500. It's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I need to make a decision.  Bob's offer of $9,000 is still too low for me, and with only a few rounds left, I'm concerned that we won't be able to reach a mutually acceptable price. To avoid risking losing out on a sale completely, I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a guaranteed sale and ensures I get a good return on the product."
