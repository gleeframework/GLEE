"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a significant compromise. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product to your business. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. That's the best I can do.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
