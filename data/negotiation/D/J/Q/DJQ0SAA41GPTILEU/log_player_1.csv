I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I'm hoping it will maximize my potential profit.  I have the safety net of John's offer if Bob rejects, so I can afford to be a bit aggressive.  I'll be watching Bob's reaction closely and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $950,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm hoping it's enough to entice Bob to come closer to my desired price point. I'm still aiming for a higher profit, but I also want to avoid risking a stalemate."

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer and closer to my desired price.  I'm happy to accept it and move on."
