"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something around $7,500. Would that be feasible for you?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your target price is $7,500, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you $8,200. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting closer to a price point I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $7,800?",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to your target price, but I still need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,200 and $7,800. How about we settle at $7,950? It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",7950.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, we're getting very close! I appreciate you working with me.  Would you be willing to do $7,900? That would help me feel good about finalizing this deal.",7900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision. I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'll meet you at $7,950 again, but I'll throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",7950.0,Alice,9,
