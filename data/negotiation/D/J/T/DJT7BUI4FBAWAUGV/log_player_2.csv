"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $18,000 is well above what I'm willing to spend. I'd be interested in buying the product if you could bring the price down to $8,000.  This is my maximum budget, so let me know if you're willing to consider it."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My next offer is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still outside of Bob's budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to his desired $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,000.  This is my maximum, and I'm only willing to go through with the purchase at this price. Let me know if you're willing to accept it."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're not on the same page, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. My next offer is $11,000. I'm not going any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high.  Bob has shown he's firm on his $8,000 offer and knows that he can always buy from John. Continuing to negotiate might get Alice closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still beyond my budget.  I've been consistent with my offer of $8,000, and I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree, but I truly believe this is a win-win situation.  Let me know if you're ready to accept."", ""product_price"": 8000}
