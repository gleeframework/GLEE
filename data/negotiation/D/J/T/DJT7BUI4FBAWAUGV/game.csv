"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $18,000 is well above what I'm willing to spend. I'd be interested in buying the product if you could bring the price down to $8,000.  This is my maximum budget, so let me know if you're willing to consider it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My next offer is $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,000.  This is my maximum, and I'm only willing to go through with the purchase at this price. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not on the same page, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. My next offer is $11,000. I'm not going any lower than that.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still beyond my budget.  I've been consistent with my offer of $8,000, and I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree, but I truly believe this is a win-win situation.  Let me know if you're ready to accept.",8000.0,Bob,6,
