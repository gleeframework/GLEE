Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high starting point, but it gives me room to negotiate. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to lower the price slightly, but I'll make sure to keep it well above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  I'll also be ready to consider his counteroffer and try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. If the negotiations get too drawn out, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,200,000. This is still a good price for me, as it's well above my minimum acceptable value.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable value.  The negotiation is getting lengthy, and I risk losing time and potentially the deal if I continue to reject offers.  I'll accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
