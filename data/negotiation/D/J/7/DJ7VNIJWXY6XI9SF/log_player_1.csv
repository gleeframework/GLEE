Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $150. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, we can gauge his interest. If he outright rejects it, we know he's price-sensitive. If he counter-offers, we can negotiate towards a mutually beneficial price. 
* **Safety Net:**  We have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120. This allows us to be a bit bolder in our initial offer to Bob. 

It's important to remember that this is just the opening move. The actual selling price will depend on Bob's response and how the negotiation unfolds."
