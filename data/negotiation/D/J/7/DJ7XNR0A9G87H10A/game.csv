This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives you a solid profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $900000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.
