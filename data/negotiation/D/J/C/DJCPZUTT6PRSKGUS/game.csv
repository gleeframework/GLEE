"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which still gives you a good deal.  Let's find a middle ground so we can both be happy.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer. However, $7,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,250 to make this deal happen. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would be a shame to miss out on this opportunity. Let's finalize this and make this deal work.",8250.0,Alice,5,
