{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's always better to try negotiating with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a very low counteroffer, half of Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it establishes a strong starting point for negotiation.  Alice is unlikely to accept this immediately, but it will signal my serious intent to buy the product at a significantly lower price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price. There's still room for negotiation. I'll make another counteroffer, aiming to get closer to my target price without risking going over my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $1,300,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, showing Alice that I'm serious about making a deal.  It's still significantly lower than her offer, leaving space for further negotiation while staying within my budget."

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer again to $1,450,000. This is a significant step closer to Alice's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping this shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product and willing to compromise, but not willing to overpay."
