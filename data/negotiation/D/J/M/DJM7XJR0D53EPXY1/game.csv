"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'd like to see if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm ready to pay $1,000,000 for this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair value for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm still feeling a bit stretched.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the best value for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm making a final counteroffer at $1,075,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
