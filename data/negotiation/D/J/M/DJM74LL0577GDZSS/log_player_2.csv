"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $11,500. This is a special opportunity for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value the product at $12,000,  $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a good deal for you considering your value of $10,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. Considering the value of the product to you and my position, I would like to propose a price of $11,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both parties involved. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Current Offer:** Alice's offer of $11,000 is still better than John's offer of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are small. There's a risk Alice might walk away, and then Bob would have to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price and minimizes the risk of losing out on the deal altogether."
