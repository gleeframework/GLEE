"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe it's a great value considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the potential value the product offers Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open Ended:** The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to respond and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's willing to negotiate. There's still room to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.
* **Value of Time:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 would be the safest option, but it's worth exploring if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.  Continuing the negotiation allows me to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still reflects the value this product holds for you, and gives us a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm lowering my price but only slightly, showing I'm willing to negotiate but also maintaining my value.
* **Highlighting Value for Bob:**  I'm emphasizing that the price still reflects the value the product holds for him, which can sway his decision.
* **Open-Ended Approach:**  I'm ending the message with an open question to encourage further dialogue and negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it's still not enough.
* **Time Factor:** We're already in Round 4.  While I could accept and get a decent price, continuing the negotiation could potentially lead to a better outcome.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer.  Negotiating with him could lead to a price closer to my desired value.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe option, but I'd rather try to get closer to my ideal price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000.  This price represents a fair deal for both of us.  I'm confident this product will be valuable for you, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price exactly between my minimum and Bob's current offer, showing a strong desire to reach a deal. 
* **Emphasize Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as fair for both parties, making it less likely that Bob will feel pressured or taken advantage of.
* **Closing the Deal:**  The message conveys a sense of finality,  suggesting that I'm ready to close the deal at this price, making it more enticing for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're already in Round 6, and the negotiation is starting to drag on. 
* **Limited Room for Compromise:** While Bob is willing to negotiate, his offers are still lower than my desired price.  There's a significant gap between our expectations.
* **Value of John's Offer:** John's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price and represents a guaranteed profit. There's no guarantee that I can close a deal with Bob at a higher price within the remaining rounds.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Selling to John minimizes risk and ensures I get my desired price. It's the most sensible option considering the time constraints and the limited potential for a better deal with Bob."
