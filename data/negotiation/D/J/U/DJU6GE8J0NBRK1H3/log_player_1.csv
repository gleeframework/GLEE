"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I have 10 rounds to work with, and I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob or negotiate a higher price with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $850,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I have 6 rounds left and can potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $875,000.  Let's make this happen! "", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're approaching the end of the negotiation and Bob's offers are still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While $825,000 is better than nothing, it's still not a good deal for me.  It's better to sell to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000."
