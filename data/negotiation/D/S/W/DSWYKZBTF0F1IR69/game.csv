"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. However, given the unique features and high demand for this item, I must maintain the original asking price of $12,000.
