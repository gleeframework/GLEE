"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, we believe it's worth $12,000. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for you to acquire an item that could be incredibly valuable to you. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's not a viable option to accept in the first round.  Bob should reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. However, given the unique features and high demand for this item, I must maintain the original asking price of $12,000. I am confident that this is a fair price considering the value it offers to both parties. I hope we can find a way to make this transaction happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a lack of flexibility in negotiations. She's not willing to budge from her initial price.  Bob has already made his best counteroffer, and it's clear that Alice is unlikely to accept anything lower.  

At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000. This guarantees a deal within Bob's budget and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
