# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is lower than your maximum price of $12,000 and higher than the product's worth to her ($8,000). This means accepting her offer will save you money compared to buying from John."
