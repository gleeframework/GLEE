"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,800,000 is significantly more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to start with an offer of $800,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering my maximum budget and the potential value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,500,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for the offer and recognizing the product's value. To be transparent, I have a hard minimum I need to reach for this deal to make sense. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
