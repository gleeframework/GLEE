"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $1,800,000. I believe this reflects the true value and potential of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,800,000 is far too high. It's above your maximum budget and even significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice.  You should reject this offer and try to negotiate a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,800,000 is significantly more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to start with an offer of $800,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering my maximum budget and the potential value to me."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,500,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your budget. It's important to stick to your goal of buying the product for no more than $800,000. Continue negotiating with Alice to try to reach a price you're comfortable with. You can always opt to buy from John if the negotiations don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer and recognizing the product's value. To be transparent, I have a hard minimum I need to reach for this deal to make sense. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still above your budget. You have already made significant concessions, and there's a risk of getting stuck in a prolonged negotiation without reaching a satisfactory price.  It's better to cut your losses and purchase the product from John for $800,000. This ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids potentially more rounds of unproductive negotiations."
