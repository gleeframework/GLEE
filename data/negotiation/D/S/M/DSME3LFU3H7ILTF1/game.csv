"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $750,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll consider selling it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $875,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $800,000 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is a price you're comfortable with.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However,  $850,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. My final offer is $820,000. If you can't accept that, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",820000.0,Bob,6,
