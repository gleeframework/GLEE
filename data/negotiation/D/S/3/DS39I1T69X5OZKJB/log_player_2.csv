"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You can do better than $10,000.  Since you're willing to pay up to $12,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

This offer is a good starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her minimum acceptable price. This shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product but also want to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is a good compromise. It's still within your budget, and you've saved $500 compared to her first offer.  There's a risk of further negotiation, but the potential savings are smaller and the risk of losing the deal increases. It's a good time to accept the offer."
