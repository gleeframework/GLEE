,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to pay $7500 for the product.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need $8500 to make it worth my while. Would you be willing to go up to that price?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. $8500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to pay $8250 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  What do you think?",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, Bob. However, $8250 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8250 and $8500, which would be $8375. Would you be willing to go up to that price?",8375.0,Alice,5,
