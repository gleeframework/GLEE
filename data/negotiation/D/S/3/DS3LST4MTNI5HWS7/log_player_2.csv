"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to purchase it from me for $9000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $8,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $9,000. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before buying from John for $8,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to pay $7,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need $8500 to make it worth my while. Would you be willing to go up to that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his ideal price, he can still try to negotiate lower. He has a solid alternative in John who is selling for $8,000, so there's no need to rush into a deal at $8,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position. $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to pay $8,250 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, Bob. However, $8250 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8250 and $8500, which would be $8375. Would you be willing to go up to that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $8,000.  At this point, Alice's counteroffer is only $375 lower than John's price.  There's a good chance that further negotiation with Alice will result in a price that's still higher than John's offer.  It's more efficient to buy from John and save the time and effort of continued negotiation."
