"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than what John is selling for, there's room for negotiation.  You want to save as much money as possible and see if you can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $105?  I'm ready to buy if we can find a price we both agree on."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** You're offering a price that's closer to Alice's value ($100) but still leaves room for some profit for her.
* **Clear communication:**  The message explains your reasoning for the counteroffer and shows you're serious about buying. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message emphasizes your willingness to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your ideal price. While you could continue to negotiate,  $115 is within your budget and a good deal compared to buying from John. It's unlikely you'll get a significantly lower price from Alice."
