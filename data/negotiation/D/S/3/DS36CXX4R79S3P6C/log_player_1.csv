Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is a good compromise between my minimum value of $80 and Bob's estimated value of $120. It leaves room for negotiation if needed but gives me a good starting point to potentially make a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to pay less than $100 for the product. Could you consider lowering the price to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting Bob's offer of $90 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum threshold of $80 and allows me to secure a sale without risking further negotiation or potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
