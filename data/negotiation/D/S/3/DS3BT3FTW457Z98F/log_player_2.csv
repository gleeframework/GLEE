"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but I'm only willing to pay $900,000 for it.  This is a significant discount, and reflects the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a strong counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's price, but still within his budget. This establishes a clear negotiating position and leaves room for compromise in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price.  How about $1,050,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. Bob can likely push for a lower price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a fair price, and I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the value I place on your product. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increases his counteroffer, showing he's willing to compromise. However, he stays firmly within his budget and makes a strong case for his price. This counteroffer signals that Bob is serious about making a deal but won't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial asking price, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is now exactly the same as what John is offering. Since Bob has the option to buy from John, there is no benefit to continuing negotiations with Alice.  There's a chance Alice might lower her price further, but the risk of delaying and potentially ending up with nothing is too high.  It's better to secure the product at the best current price from John."
