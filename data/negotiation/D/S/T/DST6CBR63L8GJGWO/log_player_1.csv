Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm hoping I can get a bit closer to my desired price of $10,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $8,875. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum and it seems like Bob is firm on his offer. I'd rather sell to Bob for $8,875 than sell to John for $8,000."
