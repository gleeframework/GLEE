Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, starting with a significantly higher offer allows room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price without revealing specific details.  
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is positive and inviting, encouraging Bob to engage in discussion rather than outright rejecting the offer. 

By aiming high, Alice maximizes her chances of securing a deal significantly above her minimum selling price. Even if Bob negotiates down, Alice is in a strong position with her guaranteed backup offer from John."
