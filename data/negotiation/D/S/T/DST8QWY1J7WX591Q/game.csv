"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1700000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth $1500000 to you for a slight premium. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1700000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1600000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1650000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my budget. How about $1580000?",1580000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this deal done. While I'm open to negotiation, $1580000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1620000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with the outcome.",1620000.0,Alice,5,
