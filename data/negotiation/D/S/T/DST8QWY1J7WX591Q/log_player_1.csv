While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price slightly higher than his in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this deal done. While I'm open to negotiation, $1,580,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,620,000?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum, but I've only got 4 rounds left. If I keep rejecting, he might walk away, and I risk getting nothing.  I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's a guaranteed sale, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
