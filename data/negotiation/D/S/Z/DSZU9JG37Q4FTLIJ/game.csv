"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is my final offer.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're sticking to your budget.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,030,000 just doesn't work for me.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm offering $1,055,000.  It's a good deal for both of us and avoids further back and forth.",1055000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting closer! While I appreciate your commitment,  $1,025,000 still doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to drop to $1,040,000.  This is my final offer before I move on to other options. ",1040000.0,Alice,7,
