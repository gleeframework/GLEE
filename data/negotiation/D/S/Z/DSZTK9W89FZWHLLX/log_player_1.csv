Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Offering $14,000 to Bob is a strategic move. It allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** It's a significant price for Bob, giving me a substantial profit. 
* **Mitigate risk:**  While it's lower than Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly higher than what I would receive from John, reducing the risk of a rejection. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Bob might be willing to negotiate slightly, but it's a strong starting point."
