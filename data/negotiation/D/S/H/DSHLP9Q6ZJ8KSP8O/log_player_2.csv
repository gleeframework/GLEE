"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he can get from John. It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice will lower her price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to John's offer. This counteroffer is a starting point for negotiation, leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While Bob has limited rounds, it's still more advantageous to keep negotiating and try to get a lower price. There's always a chance Alice will lower her price further, or Bob might be able to reach a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, aiming to find a middle ground. This offer is still lower than Alice's last offer, but it shows Bob's willingness to compromise.  He's also taking into account the limited number of rounds remaining and the potential risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still significantly higher than what he can get from John. With only 5 rounds remaining, there's a high chance the negotiation will stall, or Alice might not budge any further.  It's more prudent for Bob to secure the product at a fixed price from John and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
