"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I know will be a valuable asset to your business. I'm confident it's worth $1000000 to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $900000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. Can you meet me at this price or is there some flexibility to negotiate further?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I appreciate your offer. While I value your interest and recognize the market value, $750000 is significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's go with $825000. This price reflects the product's unique value and allows us both to reach an agreeable outcome. ",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $825000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can you consider $775000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",775000.0,Bob,4,
