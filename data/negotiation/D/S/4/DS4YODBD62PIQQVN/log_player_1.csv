Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Aiming high initially allows you to potentially get the best possible price from Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob doesn't accept $9,500, it opens the door for negotiation. He might counter-offer, and you can still likely settle on a price higher than your guaranteed $8,000 from John.
* **Understand Value Perception:**  You know Bob values the product at $10,000. By offering it slightly below that, you're highlighting the value he'd gain while still securing a significant profit for yourself."
