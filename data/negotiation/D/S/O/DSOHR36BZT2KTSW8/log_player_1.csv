Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, there's room to negotiate above my minimum price of $800,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves a potential profit of $300,000 for me while still offering Bob a $100,000 discount compared to his perceived value. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Adding a time constraint (""limited-time offer"") can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without trying to negotiate lower.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. If Bob rejects this initial offer, there might be room for further negotiation before moving on to John."
