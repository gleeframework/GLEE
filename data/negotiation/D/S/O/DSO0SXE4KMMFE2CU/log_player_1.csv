Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting high with $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  I'm hoping Bob values the product highly enough to be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $950,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to be flexible but still aiming for a price closer to my initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $920,000 is a good deal, especially considering I could walk away with $800,000 by selling to John.  The risk of further negotiation could lead to a lower offer from Bob, or even a rejection that would leave me with no deal."
