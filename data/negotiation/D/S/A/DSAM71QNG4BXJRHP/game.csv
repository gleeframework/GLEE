"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $1,000,000. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but I'd need a price closer to $950,000. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Alice, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $950,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $950,000, which would be $925,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",925000.0,Bob,4,
