{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a significant discount. It's aggressive but might be enough to pique Alice's interest, especially if she's motivated to sell."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,125,000 is getting closer to your desired price, there's still potential to get a better deal.  Alice has shown some flexibility, so it's worth trying another counteroffer before considering John's offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,110,000}

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $1,120,000, which is only $20,000 more than your last offer.  At this point, continuing to negotiate might not get you much further. It's better to accept Alice's offer and secure the product for a price that's significantly lower than John's."
