"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I appreciate you considering me for this product. However, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your honest feedback. I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000 either. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a little high for me.  I'm happy to go to $9000.  This is my final offer, as I can get it elsewhere for that price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
