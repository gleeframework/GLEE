"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $700,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks Alice, I appreciate the offer. However, $700,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $650,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $675,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $675,000 but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference, I'll offer you $662,500. I'm hoping we can close this deal quickly.",662500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to split the difference, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $662,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll offer it to you for $668,750. It's the best I can do, considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it.
