"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1000000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have a strong interest in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with your offer of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $950000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still think $950000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1075000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point. What are your thoughts?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1075000. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1050000. I've already met you halfway multiple times, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need $1025000 to make this deal worthwhile. This is my final counteroffer. What are your thoughts?",1025000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1025000. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. This is my final offer.",975000.0,Bob,8,
