You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to try to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $800,000. This is a bold move, but Alice knows she has room to negotiate down from her $1,500,000 valuation. Hopefully, this will start a productive negotiation, and we can find a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $900,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to stay within a reasonable range. I'm hoping this offer will be acceptable to Alice, but I'm prepared to make a final counteroffer if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $1,100,000 is still too high for my budget. I'll reject her offer and make one final counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer. I'm increasing my offer to $950,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still within my budget. I believe this is a fair price considering Alice's willingness to negotiate. If Alice rejects this offer, I'll buy the product from John to ensure I get the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down further, $1,050,000 is still over my budget.  I've already made multiple counteroffers and it seems clear that we won't be able to reach an agreement.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John.  At $800,000, I'm getting the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
