Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $140 is higher than your minimum of $120, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $140 is lower than Bob's value of $150, making it a potentially attractive offer to him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, you have room to adjust the price without going below your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still above your minimum of $120, and it's likely that you won't get a better offer from him.  There's always the chance he might counter again, but accepting this offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
