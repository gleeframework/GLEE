Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation, while still leaving room to potentially lower the price if necessary.  I'm hoping Bob will find the product valuable enough to be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is a good price, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm offering $9,750.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still want a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price,  Bob's offer of $9,400 is getting closer to my desired value.  I'm not sure if I can get a better price with further negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely. It's better to accept this offer and secure a good deal."
