Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation while ensuring I get at least $100 (my minimum). I'll see if Bob is willing to pay this price, and then we can go from there!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my initial price of $150. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering $135. It's a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, Bob is firm at $120, and continuing to negotiate might risk him walking away entirely. This offer guarantees me a profit, and it's better than selling to John for $100."
