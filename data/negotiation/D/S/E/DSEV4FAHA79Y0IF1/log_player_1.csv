Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This gives me a little room to negotiate if Bob counters, while still being more than what the product is worth to me. I'll see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is a compromise that's closer to my desired price but still allows for a little bit of room for negotiation. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in my product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,000, and John is already willing to pay that.  It's better to sell to John and guarantee myself a profit."
