"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's initial value, you can still do better. You have a guaranteed alternative with John for $8,000, so there's no reason to accept anything more than that.  A counteroffer gives you the chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it's still above your maximum value. It's a good starting point for negotiation. It also shows Alice you're serious about getting a good deal, while still leaving room for a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above your maximum value of $8,000. However, it is a good deal compared to her previous offer of $11,000 and closer to your acceptable price range. Since you have the guaranteed alternative of buying from John for $8,000, you can afford to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
