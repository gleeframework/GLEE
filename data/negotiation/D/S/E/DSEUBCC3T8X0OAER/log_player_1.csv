This offer gives Bob a potential $3,000 profit, making it attractive for him. It also ensures I get a good price that's closer to my minimum value, minimizing potential loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."

I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,000, which is still a good profit for me while being a more reasonable price for Bob. This offer demonstrates flexibility while still holding firm on a price that is fair for both of us."
