Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's halfway between your minimum value and Bob's maximum value. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you get a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation for the product. I am willing to pay $130 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is above your minimum price of $120, and while it's less than your initial offer, it's still a good deal. There's no guarantee you'll get a better offer in the next round, and it's always possible that Bob could walk away. Accepting his offer secures a sale and a decent profit."
