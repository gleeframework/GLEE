"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I think $900,000 is a bit steep.  I'd be willing to start the negotiations at $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product's value is higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. To be completely transparent, I have a budget of $800,000 for this purchase.  Would you be willing to meet that price?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not willing to go all the way down to $800,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
