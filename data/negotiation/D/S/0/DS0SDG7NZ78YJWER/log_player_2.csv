Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $11,000 for the product, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice has come down to $11,000 and stated this is her final offer.  Continuing to push for a lower price might irritate her and she may not budge. It's a reasonable price saving of $4,000 from John's offer and a good compromise."
