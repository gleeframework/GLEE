"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we begin our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we try $950,000? I think this is a fair price that still gives you a great deal, but also recognizes the value of the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $950,000 is still pushing it for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I need to make sure it fits within my budget.  What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $975,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
