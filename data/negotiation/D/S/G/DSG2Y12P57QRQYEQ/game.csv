"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $11,000? This still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a fair profit.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I'm willing to be flexible, but $10,500 still isn't quite where I need to be. Let's compromise - how about $10,800? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",10800.0,Alice,5,
