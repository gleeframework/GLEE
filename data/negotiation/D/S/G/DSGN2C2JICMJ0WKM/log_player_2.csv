"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's better to reject the offer and see if you can get a lower price.  $9,000 is over your budget, and you have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500} 
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $7,500. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the realm of what I'm willing to pay. Hopefully, this will start the negotiation process and lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $8,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
``` 

I'm going to offer Alice $8,000. This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to her. Hopefully, she'll accept it."
