"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider a lower price of $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $900,000. Would that be something you'd consider?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility.  I'm getting closer to my budget, but to make this work I'd need to be at $950,000.  Do you think we can make that work?",950000.0,Bob,6,
