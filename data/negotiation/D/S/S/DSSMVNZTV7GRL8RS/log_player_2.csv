"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you placed on the product, while also ensuring I get a good return on my investment. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget. There's still room for further negotiation, and Bob should try to get closer to his target price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good return on your investment, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. I can offer the product to you for $1,320,000. This is a compromise that should be more in line with your budget, while still allowing me to get a decent return on my investment. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  At this point, the negotiation is getting close to Bob's limit, and there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a further counteroffer. To avoid risking further negotiation and potentially losing the product, it's best for Bob to secure the product from John at his guaranteed price."
