Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum value of $80. This gives me room to negotiate if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build rapport with Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies flexibility by asking for Bob's thoughts. This encourages him to counteroffer if necessary.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** By starting high, I have more potential to earn a higher price.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** Bob's response will provide valuable information about his willingness to pay.
* **Maintain Flexibility:**  I can adjust my price based on Bob's response or move on to John if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to earn more, Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price.  Since I can sell to John for the same amount, accepting Bob's offer makes sense.  It avoids further negotiation and ensures a quick sale."
