"I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of $12000, which is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. Let me know if that works for you!",12000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm glad you're serious about the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my original price. How about we meet at $10500? It's a compromise that works for me, and I think you'll find it's a fair deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9500, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, and I think we can do business at this price.",9500.0,Bob,6,,
