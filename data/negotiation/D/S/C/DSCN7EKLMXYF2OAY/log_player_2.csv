"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to meet your specific needs and expectations. I believe it would be a valuable asset for you. Considering its quality and the benefits it provides, I'm offering it to you for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a decent starting point, Bob can likely get a better price. It's worth exploring counteroffers and seeing if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the quality of your product, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to ensure that the transaction remains profitable for me. Therefore, I propose a price of $9,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for less than $9,000.  Alice has come down a bit, but it's still not in Bob's ideal range. There's room for further negotiation, so Bob should continue to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $9,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to offer $8,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, and $8,875 is a price that Bob can comfortably afford while still saving money compared to buying from John. Accepting this offer is the best option at this point."
