You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer gives you a chance to get a better deal.  You can make a counteroffer closer to your desired price, potentially saving more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Value:**  Alice values the product at $8,000. 
* **Your Value:** You value the product at $10,000. 
* **Potential Savings:**  A counteroffer of $8,500 offers a potential savings of $500 for you.  
* **Negotiation:**  This counteroffer starts the negotiation, allowing you to potentially get a better price than John's $10,000. 

While there is a chance Alice might reject this, it's a reasonable starting point that shows you're serious about negotiating and are willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:**  $9,200 is a slight increase from her previous offer.
* **Your Value:** You value the product at $10,000.
* **John's Price:** John is selling the product for $10,000.
* **Potential Savings:** Accepting Alice's offer saves you $800 compared to buying from John.

While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower price. Accepting her offer secures the product at a price that's still within your budget and saves you money compared to the alternative."
