"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob to make the price seem more appealing.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:** I'm giving Bob space to counter, keeping the negotiation going without being too aggressive. 
* **Keeping John in mind:** While I want to maximize profit, I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is below my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).** While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I want for the product.
* **I have time and leverage.**  I'm not in a rush to sell, and I have a backup option with John. 
* **Rejection gives me more leverage.** By rejecting Bob's counteroffer, I can signal my firm stance and potentially get a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  I'm prepared to offer you the product for $11,000.  This is a fair price given the value you've indicated and allows us to both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer, but with a clear stance:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but showing I'm open to negotiation. 
* **Slightly reduced price:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I'm framing my counteroffer as a fair price that benefits both of us.  This helps build rapport and makes it harder for Bob to reject. 
* **Leaving room for another counteroffer:** I'm still above Bob's initial offer, allowing for a potential counter from him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but I still believe we can find a middle ground. How about $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.**  While it's closer, it's still not enough for me to consider selling.
* **I have a strong backup option.** I can sell to John for $15,000, so I don't need to settle for a low price just to close a deal.
* **Negotiation is still ongoing.**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to push for a higher price and potentially reach a more agreeable outcome.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will send Bob a counteroffer closer to my desired price, but still within a range that allows for further negotiation. I'll continue to emphasize the value of the product and the fairness of my offers."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering the product for $10,750. This shows my willingness to compromise, and I'm confident this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  I'm taking the midpoint between my last offer ($11,000) and Bob's current offer ($10,500). This shows a clear commitment to finding common ground. 
* **Emphasizing compromise:** I'm highlighting my willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway. This makes the offer seem more reasonable and increases the chance of acceptance.
* **Building towards agreement:**  This offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price while still being above my minimum. It sets the stage for a potential agreement in the next few rounds.
* **Keeping John in mind:** While $10,750 is significantly less than John's offer, I'm still within a range where it's worth continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle. I'll counter with $10,600. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:**  Bob's offer of $10,600 is only $150 away from my last counteroffer of $10,750. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I would prefer a higher price, the negotiation has been going back and forth.  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal and move on. 
* **Time is a factor:**  We've already gone through six rounds.  If I keep rejecting, it's possible that Bob will walk away, and I might end up selling to John for a lower price than I could get from Bob.
* **John's offer is still a backup:** Even though I'm accepting Bob's offer, I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000.  This gives me peace of mind knowing that I have a secure alternative if needed."
