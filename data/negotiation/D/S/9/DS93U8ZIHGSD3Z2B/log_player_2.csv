"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than the $15,000 from John, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is closer to Alice's valuation of the product ($10,000) while still leaving some room for negotiation. This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. I can do $11,800, but I have to say that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'd love to hear your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,800 is still a good deal for Bob compared to John's price of $15,000.  While there's always the chance to push for a lower price, accepting this offer secures a product Bob wants at a significantly lower cost than the alternative. It's a smart move to avoid further negotiation and lock in the savings."
