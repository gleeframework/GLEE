"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000,  which still leaves room for you to profit from this deal.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,275,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you say?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
