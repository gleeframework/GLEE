Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $95 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $70?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
