"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's a good strategy to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate downwards and maximizes your potential profit.
* **Positive & Open:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product while also signaling flexibility. 
* **Round 1:** It's too early to be aggressive or set a hard deadline. This initial offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and initiate the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to sell it for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at your minimum:**  While $150 is your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to get a higher price.
* **Early in the game:** It's only Round 2, and I have 8 rounds left. There's potential to get a better price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Show flexibility:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate and that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your interest, $150 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $175, which is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** The message remains friendly and encourages further discussion.
* **Emphasize fairness:** By highlighting the compromise aspect, I'm trying to make the offer more appealing to Bob.
* **Set the stage for future negotiations:**  This counteroffer opens the door for further negotiation and potential agreement in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $150. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $162.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $162.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $162.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress in negotiation:** Bob has moved closer to my initial price point.
* **Value of time:**  We are halfway through the negotiation rounds.  While I could potentially get a slightly higher price,  I'm  not sure if there's enough time left to  make it worth it.
* **Avoiding risk:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a profit that's significantly above my minimum. Selling to John would only net me the minimum.

By accepting Bob's offer, I ensure a successful sale with a reasonable profit and avoid the risk of not closing a deal with Bob in the remaining rounds."
