Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,500,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which is my maximum. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach $1,200,000. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John at this point rather than risking a lower final offer from Bob or a stalemate in negotiations.  Time is valuable in business, and John represents a sure deal."
