"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,500,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which is my maximum. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,350,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise considering your initial offer and my budget constraints.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's settle this at $1,250,000.  This price reflects the considerable value you're receiving while recognizing your budget considerations.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering our previous discussions and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
