"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business.  I've done my research, and I know it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you.  To make this a truly advantageous deal for both of us, I'm willing to sell it for $1,150,000.  This price point ensures a significant return on your investment while allowing me to achieve my desired profit margin.  What do you say?  Let's discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to anchor you to a high price by claiming you'll get $1,200,000 of value.  While you have a buffer between her offer and John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting her initial offer might lead to a better counter-offer closer to her $1,000,000 valuation."
