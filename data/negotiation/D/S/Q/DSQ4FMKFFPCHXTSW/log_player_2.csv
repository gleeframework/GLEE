{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  There's no reason to accept it. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a reasonable range. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a good deal."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

Bob is getting closer to his limit but still wants to save some money. This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise, while still remaining within his budget. It leaves some room for negotiation, while also putting pressure on Alice to accept a price closer to Bob's goal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his $10,000 limit.  There's a good chance Alice might be willing to go lower, and Bob should try to push for that lower price.  He can always buy from John if the negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway, but also wants to stay within his budget. Offering $10,500 shows he is serious about buying the product but is also pushing Alice to come down to a price he's comfortable with. This is a final attempt to negotiate before resorting to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his limit. At this point, Bob has pushed the negotiation as far as he can and is willing to accept John's offer to stay within his budget. It's unlikely Alice will come down further, and Bob doesn't want to risk further negotiation."
