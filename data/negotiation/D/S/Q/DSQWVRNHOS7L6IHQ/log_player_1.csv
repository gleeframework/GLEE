Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119.  I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Price:**  Since the product is worth $100 to Bob, he won't pay more than that. 
* **Minimum Price:** You have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John.
* **Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum value ($119) creates the perception of a deal while still maximizing your potential profit. 

This strategy aims to secure a sale quickly and potentially earn a higher profit than waiting for John."
