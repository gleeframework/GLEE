Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This reflects the true value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
