"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell it to you for $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $145. It's getting close to my minimum price, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",145.0,Alice,5,
