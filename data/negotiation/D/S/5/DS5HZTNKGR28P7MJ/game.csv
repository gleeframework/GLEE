"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to your offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,200. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8200.0,Alice,5,
