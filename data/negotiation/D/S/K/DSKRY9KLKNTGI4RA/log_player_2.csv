"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its value and allows for a healthy profit for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge her flexibility.
* **Within Budget:** This offer is well within my $800,000 budget. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This first counteroffer is a way to see how Alice reacts and get a better understanding of her bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $700,000. This gives you a good deal, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice has come down considerably, her offer is still $100,000 more than John's. 
* **Strategic Bargaining:**  Continuing to negotiate shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good price but am willing to work towards a mutually beneficial deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to move closer to her price, but I'm not jumping up too drastically.
* **Staying Competitive:** This offer keeps me in a good negotiating position, as it's still significantly lower than her current offer and just below John's alternative.
* **Aiming for a Win-Win:**  The goal is to find a price that works for both of us, and this offer keeps us moving in that direction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, but $600,000 is still too far below what I need to sell.  Let's split the difference.  I'll offer you the product for $650,000.  This allows you to get a good price, and allows me to get closer to my target. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $650,000 is a significant saving compared to Alice's initial offer and a reasonable price overall.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate might not yield much better results and could risk the deal falling through.  
* **Acceptable Risk:** While John offers the product for $800,000, securing the deal now at $650,000 is a worthwhile risk."
