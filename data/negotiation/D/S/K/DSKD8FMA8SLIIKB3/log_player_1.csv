{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum price of $12,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.  This allows me to potentially secure a sale with Bob while keeping the option open to sell to John for a higher price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  I'm going to counteroffer to see if I can get him closer to my ideal price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further. I'm offering you the product for $9,500. This is a great price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,200. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $9,200 is a good compromise. It's much closer to my minimum price of $12,000 and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether or having to deal with further negotiations."
