"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need it to be much more affordable. How about we start at $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $500,000 is simply too low. This product is worth a lot more than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  I can offer you $650,000.  That's a fair offer considering the market value and my own budget.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $650,000 is still far below the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll gain from this product. Let's make this deal happen.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but I need you to come down a bit more.  How about $725,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",725000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $725,000 is still well below the value I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to drop to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits you'll receive.  Let's close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,7,
