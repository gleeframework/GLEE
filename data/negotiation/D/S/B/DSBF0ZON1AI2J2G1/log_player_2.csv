Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $11,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down in price, she seems firm at $11,500. You have a guaranteed option with John for $8,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Alice when you could save $3,500 by going with John."
