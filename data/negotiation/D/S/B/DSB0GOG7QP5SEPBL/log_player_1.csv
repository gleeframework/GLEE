"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm going to start with a high offer, aiming for a profit.  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, I believe there's room for negotiation.  If he rejects, I'll gauge his interest and adjust my offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum value. I'm going to reject and try to negotiate a better price. I believe I can push for at least $1,100,000 and still have a good outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum value, but I'm not ready to sell just yet.  I believe I can push for a higher price, even if it means going a few more rounds.  There's a good chance he'll come up to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to meet him halfway and offer $1,050,000.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise that could get us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. I'm not willing to go any lower, and I'm starting to run out of rounds. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
