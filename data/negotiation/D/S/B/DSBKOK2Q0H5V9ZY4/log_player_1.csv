Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially saving your company considerable resources.  I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  Offering it at $1,100,000 allows Alice to capture a significant portion of the value difference while still leaving Bob with a potential $100,000 gain. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a strong starting point, the message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he wishes.  
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's benefits to Bob, reinforcing why he should be willing to pay a premium.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice has the security of John's offer ($800,000). This allows her to confidently aim higher with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If Alice knows Bob to be a tough negotiator, she might start slightly lower to create more bargaining space.
* **Relationship Value:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, Alice might consider a slightly more moderate price."
