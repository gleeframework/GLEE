"Alice, your product seems great, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. How about we meet in the middle at $16,500? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $15,500? That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Bob,4,
