Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Appealing to value:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob by mentioning the $150 worth to him. This reinforces the potential for a good deal. 
* **Open-ended question:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
