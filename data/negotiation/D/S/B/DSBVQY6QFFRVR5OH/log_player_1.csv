"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, knowing it's likely Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I don't immediately close the deal at my minimum.
* **Friendly tone:** A friendly tone sets a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the recommendation. I would like to counteroffer at $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for me:** $90 is still above my minimum value of $80. However, I believe I can get closer to Bob's perceived value of $120.
* **Negotiation is key:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price.
* **Time is on my side:** I have 8 rounds remaining, so I'm not under immediate pressure to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $90 is a good price, I'm looking for something a bit closer to $100. Let's meet in the middle at $95. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise and reach a deal.
* **Staying above minimum:** $95 is still significantly above my minimum of $80, ensuring I get a good deal.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to counteroffer at $92 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:**  Bob's offer of $92 is only $3 away from my last offer of $95. 
* **Time is a factor:** We are already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by being too stubborn.
* **Profitable:** $92 is still a good profit for me and above my minimum value of $80. 

It's important to balance getting the best price with the risk of losing the deal altogether.  In this case, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most sensible option."
