"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
