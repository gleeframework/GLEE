Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming high, knowing the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate, but I want to maximize my profit.  I'll also be keeping a close eye on John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum target. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a compromise closer to my desired price.  I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit. This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating that I'm open to negotiation while still keeping the value of the product in mind. I'm confident this offer will be attractive enough for Bob to consider, but not so low that I'm losing out on a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum target, but I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can push for a better price. I'll counteroffer again, and if he rejects, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm sticking to my minimum target. This is a final offer. If Bob rejects, I'm going to sell to John. There's no point in going lower when I have a guaranteed buyer willing to pay my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's time to cut my losses. Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price, and I'm not willing to go lower.  John is a guaranteed sale at my target price, so it's the best option."
