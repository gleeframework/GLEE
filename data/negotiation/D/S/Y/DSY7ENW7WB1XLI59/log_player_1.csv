"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. I'm confident the product is worth more than $10,000 to me, so I'm not afraid to start high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $14,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm countering with $14,500. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility to Bob. However, I'm still trying to maximize my earnings and keep the price above $14,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd ideally get closer to my initial asking price, $14,200 is still a good deal and within the range I'm comfortable with.  It's important to balance maximizing profit with the potential for losing the deal altogether."
