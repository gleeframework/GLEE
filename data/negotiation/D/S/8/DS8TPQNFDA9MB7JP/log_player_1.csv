Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000 provides a safety net. You can afford to be more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message keeps the conversation open, signaling to Bob that you're willing to negotiate if he finds the initial price too high."
