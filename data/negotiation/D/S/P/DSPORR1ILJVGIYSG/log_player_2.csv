"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $95. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $95. It's worth $100 to Bob. Rejecting the offer is a good starting point to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is too low for me. How about we settle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

``` 
While $90 is better than $95, it's still above the product's value to Alice.  It's worth trying to get closer to her minimum by making another counteroffer."
