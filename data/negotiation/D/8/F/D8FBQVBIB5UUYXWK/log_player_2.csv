"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. You're aiming to save as much money as possible, so it's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to get closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This would still be a significant value for you, and it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and still allows Bob to save $100,000 compared to his initial counteroffer.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice could walk away, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
