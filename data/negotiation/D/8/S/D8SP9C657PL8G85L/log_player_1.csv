Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profits. I'm leaving room for negotiation if Bob is interested but not willing to pay the full $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price.  $130 is closer to my minimum, but I'm hoping to get closer to my original asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to meet halfway and reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is very close to my initial counteroffer and is above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm accepting his offer to secure the sale and avoid potentially losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
