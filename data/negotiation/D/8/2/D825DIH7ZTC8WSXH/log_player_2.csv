Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above your maximum budget of $12,000. You've already made multiple counteroffers and it seems like Alice is unwilling to go lower.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for your maximum price and avoid further negotiation."
