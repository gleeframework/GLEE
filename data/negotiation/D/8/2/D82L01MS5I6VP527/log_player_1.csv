Bob's offer:

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently remained well below my minimum acceptable price. His final offer of $950,000 indicates he's unlikely to significantly increase his valuation. Accepting further counteroffers risks prolonging the negotiation and potentially losing the guaranteed offer from John. Selling to John for $1,200,000 ensures I get the product's full value."
