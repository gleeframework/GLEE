You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I know the value of this product, and $95 is still too low for me.  I could go down to $130, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

It's time to walk away. Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $130, and it's not worth risking a higher price when you have a guaranteed offer for $100 from John."
