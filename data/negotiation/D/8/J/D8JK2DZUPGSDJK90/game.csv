"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in price and recognize that you're serious about this purchase.  To be fully transparent, I have another buyer interested at a significantly higher price point. However, I believe in finding the right fit for my product, and I value the potential I see with you. My final offer is $1,450,000. This is a significant concession on my part and a firm offer. Let me know if this works for you so we can close this out.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
