Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

Alice has come down to her product's value. It's unlikely she'll go lower and this is a fair price that saves you a significant amount compared to John's offer."
