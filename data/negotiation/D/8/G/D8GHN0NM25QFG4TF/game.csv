"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  I think that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
