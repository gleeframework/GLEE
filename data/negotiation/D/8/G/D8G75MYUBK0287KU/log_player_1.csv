We're getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a higher price. Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, which means he's definitely interested.  Let's see if I can nudge him a bit further in the next round."

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,110,000 makes the most sense at this point.  Here's why: 

* **Significant Profit:**  It's still a profit of $110,000 over my minimum.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I have the money to reinvest sooner rather than later. 
* **Risk of Pushing Too Far:** Bob's offer increases have become smaller. There's a risk he might walk away if I push too hard.  

It's always a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal. In this case, accepting this offer is a strategic win."
