"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is likely to be rejected by Bob, but it gives me a starting point for negotiation and sets the initial value of the product in his mind.  I'm also leaving room for some bargaining, as I'm confident the product is worth more than $8,000 to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for the bare minimum in the first round.  I have 9 more rounds and want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $9,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. It's also a good midpoint between my minimum and my initial asking price, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  $8,500 is a good price and is above my minimum acceptable price."
