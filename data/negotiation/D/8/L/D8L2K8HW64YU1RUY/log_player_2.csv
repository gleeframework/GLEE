"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking $110 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is pretty high. There's a good chance we can negotiate a better price.  We're willing to pay up to $120, so we have room to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to meet in the middle of the initial price gap. It shows we're serious but also looking for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit too low for me, considering the product's value. I'm willing to go down to $100. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, which is good, but we still have room to negotiate before hitting our $120 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $100 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Could you do $95? That would work for me."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

We're inching closer to our limit, but this counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice to compromise while showing we're still interested."
