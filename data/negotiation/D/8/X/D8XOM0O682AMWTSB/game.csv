"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to you. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still leaves you a good margin of profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $950,000. I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is more in line with my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
