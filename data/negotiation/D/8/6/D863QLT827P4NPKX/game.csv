"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a very competitive price of $1,100,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my offer?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,050,000? That's a significant discount from my original offer and still leaves room for you to profit. Let's find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $1,025,000? That's the best I can do, but I'm willing to compromise to make this deal happen.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still below my minimum. Let's aim for something in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,040,000. This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",1040000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that we're getting close, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. How about $1,015,000? That's the best I can do, but I'm willing to compromise to make this deal happen.",1015000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting very close, but $1,015,000 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time at $1,030,000. If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to consider other options.  Let's make this happen.",1030000.0,Alice,7,
