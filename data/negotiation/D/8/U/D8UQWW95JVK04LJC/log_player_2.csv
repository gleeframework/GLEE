```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and would like to make a proposal that might work for both of us.

I'm open to further discussion to ensure a fair deal for both parties.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, I am willing to accept $9950 for the product.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,950.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** You are aiming for $10,000 or less, and her offer is $9,950.
* **You are $50 away from your target.** This is a very small difference, and continuing to negotiate might not be worth the effort.
* **You have a limited number of rounds.**  You've already used 7 out of 10 rounds.

While you could try to negotiate further, it's more likely that you'll end up paying the same amount or more if you continue.  It's a good deal considering your target, and accepting the offer saves you time and effort."
