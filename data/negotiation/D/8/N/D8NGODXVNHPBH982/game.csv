"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value of the product for you and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $950,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $925,000 still isn't quite there for me. Let's compromise and settle on $940,000. This price is fair for both of us and allows us to close the deal. What do you say?",940000.0,Alice,5,
