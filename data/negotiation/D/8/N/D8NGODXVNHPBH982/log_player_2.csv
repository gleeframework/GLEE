"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let's get this done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value of the product for you and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. He's willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so there's still room to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $950,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $925,000 still isn't quite there for me. Let's compromise and settle on $940,000. This price is fair for both of us and allows us to close the deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $940,000, which is only $40,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, the risk is that Alice will either reject further offers, or the negotiations will drag on, potentially leading to a deal with John at $1,200,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
