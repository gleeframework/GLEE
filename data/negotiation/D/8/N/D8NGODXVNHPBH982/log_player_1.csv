"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring a healthy profit. I believe this is a strong starting point to gauge Bob's interest and get the deal rolling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the value I see in the product. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I want to try to get a better price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value of the product for you and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $950,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $925,000 is getting closer to what I want, I still believe I can get a better price. I have a few rounds left, and John's offer of $800,000 is a safety net if this negotiation doesn't work out. I'm going to counter Bob's offer in the next round and try to push for a price closer to $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $925,000 still isn't quite there for me. Let's compromise and settle on $940,000. This price is fair for both of us and allows us to close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 940000}
