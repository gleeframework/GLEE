{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, but still leaves room for compromise. It also explicitly acknowledges Bob's potential value from the product, hoping to encourage him to seriously consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment of the product's value, I would like to propose a price of $700,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While I want to maximize my profit, I'm not desperate to sell. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, reflecting a significant discount from my initial offer.  This price still leaves you with a considerable profit margin, while allowing me to achieve a reasonable return on my investment.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $800,000. This aligns closely with the value I see in the product and also reflects your original valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I would ideally get more, it's a good deal and ensures a sale.  There's no need to risk further negotiation."
