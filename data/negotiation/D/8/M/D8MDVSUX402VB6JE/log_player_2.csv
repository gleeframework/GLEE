"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $9,500 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $9,500 is above your maximum budget of $10,000.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  You have room to negotiate a lower price, and the game mechanics encourage negotiation. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback:**  While buying from John is an option, it's best to exhaust negotiation with Alice first to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:**  A $1,000 reduction from Alice's offer is a significant step, but it's still within the realm of reason.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer gauges Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially reveals how much she's willing to compromise. 
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  This offer still leaves room for a few more rounds of counteroffers if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high:**  While Alice has lowered her price, $9,000 is still outside my comfortable price range. 
* **Continuing to negotiate:**  There's still room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get closer to my target price of $8,500.
* **No need to rush:** I still have several rounds left to negotiate and haven't reached the point where buying from John is more favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit steep.  How about we settle at $8,750? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental approach:** Instead of jumping straight back to my initial offer, I'm making a smaller, more reasonable counteroffer. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise but also keeps the negotiation moving.
* **Meeting halfway (almost):** $8,750 is closer to Alice's offer than my previous one, demonstrating that I'm taking her proposal into account.
* **Finding common ground:** This price might be a sweet spot where both of us can find a mutually acceptable solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $8,900. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** $8,900 is only $400 higher than my ideal price of $8,500.
* **Final offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, so further negotiation may be fruitless. 
* **Saving money:** This deal still saves me $1,100 compared to buying from John.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer, I risk Alice walking away, leaving me with only the option of buying from John at a higher price."
