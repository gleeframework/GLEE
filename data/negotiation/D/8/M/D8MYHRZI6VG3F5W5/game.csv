"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking $12,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your position,  $10,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product, as I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work. Let's try $10,500. It's a fair price that's closer to your offer but still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which is a price I feel comfortable with. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle from here.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're determined to get a good deal, and I want to close this deal as well.  Let's meet in the middle on $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. It's a good deal for both of us, so let's make it happen.",9500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",9000.0,Bob,8,
