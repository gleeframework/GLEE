"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking $12,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential profit.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and persuasive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product for Bob, which may make him more willing to consider my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject and Counter:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and try to reach a more favorable outcome.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'll likely counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, emphasizing the product's value and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your position,  $10,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with Compromise:** I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reinforce Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, subtly pushing him to consider the higher price.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing the idea of a win-win scenario, making the deal more appealing for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product, as I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Negotiating:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not convinced I can't get a better price. I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob to potentially get a higher offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I believe I can still influence Bob's decision by rejecting his offer and potentially counteroffering.
* **Weighing the Risk:**  There's a risk that Bob will walk away, but I'm comfortable with that risk given my goal of maximizing my profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work. Let's try $10,500. It's a fair price that's closer to your offer but still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Again):**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This shows continued flexibility and a willingness to find common ground.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price, highlighting that it benefits both of us.
* **Urgency Implied:** I'm subtly suggesting that this might be my final offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to consider accepting."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which is a price I feel comfortable with. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle from here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not at a price I'm completely satisfied with. 
* **Potential for Improvement:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting, I can continue to try and push for a higher price.
* **Evaluating Risk:**  While selling to John for $8,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out hope for a better deal with Bob, especially as we are nearing the middle ground."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're determined to get a good deal, and I want to close this deal as well.  Let's meet in the middle on $9,500.

```

**Explanation:**

* **Urgency and Finality:**  I'm suggesting this is a final offer to encourage Bob to accept. I'm confident this price will be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $9,500. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob and having to settle with John for $8,000 is significant. 
* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely.
* **Minimizing Loss:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale and minimize potential losses. This is a strategic decision to ensure I get at least some profit."
