"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $750000 for the product.  This leaves room for both of us to make a profit, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is a fair price that takes into account your concerns and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $825000 is still a bit higher than I can go at the moment. I'm prepared to offer $775000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $800000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",800000.0,Alice,5,
