"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice.  You can potentially get a better deal than $10,000.  There's no reason to buy from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a little lower than I'm comfortable with. How about $10,800? It's closer to your offer and still a great value for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $10,800, which is still a good deal for you, as it's below your maximum value. It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and the risk of her getting more demanding."
