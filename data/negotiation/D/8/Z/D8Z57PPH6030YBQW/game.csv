"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a great fit for you, and it's valued at $15,000. To make this a smooth transaction, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for this product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $12,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think $12,000 is below the product's value, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $13,000. How about we meet at $12,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $12,500 is still cutting it close.  Would you consider $12,750? That's my final offer.",12750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away, but I still think $12,500 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we do $12,625? That's the maximum I'm willing to pay.",12625.0,Bob,6,
