"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm confident it will be a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your life.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm afraid $1200000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I can only go up to $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to my life. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of making a counteroffer of $1100000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value and the benefits it will bring to my life. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $950000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of making a counteroffer of $1050000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to make a compromise, but $1050000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to make a final offer of $920000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",920000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $920000. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to give up more. I'm going to make one more counteroffer: $1000000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
