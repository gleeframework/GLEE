"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I understand your position, the value of this product is significant and $12,000 is quite a bit below what I can accept. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I still think $18,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $18,000, which would be $15,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",15000.0,Bob,4,
