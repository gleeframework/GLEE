"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a truly unique and valuable asset. While I can't disclose the exact nature of the product at this time, I can assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me.  My initial price is $1500000. This reflects the significant value I place on this product. Let's discuss and see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the unique value you attribute to the product, but my maximum budget is $900000. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. Let's work towards a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is unfortunately too far below the value I hold for this product.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $1200000.  Let's meet in the middle to ensure a successful transaction.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your willingness to compromise. I appreciate the reduction in price, but I still feel that $1200000 is beyond my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $1100000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
