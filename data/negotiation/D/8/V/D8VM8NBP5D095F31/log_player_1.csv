"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I do recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the worth of what I'm offering. Would you consider $2,000,000?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product holds a lot of value, but I have budgetary constraints. I can move up to $1,100,000. This is a fair offer, considering John can offer me the product right now for $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is revealing information:**  Bob mentioning John's offer for $1,000,000 is likely a negotiation tactic, but it gives us valuable information. It confirms that Bob is willing to pay more than his initial offer and potentially close to our minimum.
* **We have room to negotiate:** While $1,100,000 is still below our desired price, we are in a stronger position knowing Bob's potential ceiling. We can use the remaining rounds to try and close that gap.
* **Selling to John is still an option:** We don't need to rush into accepting Bob's offer. We can use the security of John's $1,500,000 offer as leverage in further negotiations."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need a price that acknowledges the true worth of this product.  How about we meet halfway at $1,550,000? This represents a significant compromise on my part and ensures a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show willingness to compromise:** By moving closer to Bob's offer, we demonstrate flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Set a firm target:** The $1,550,000 price point is still a significant profit above our minimum and  represents a fair deal considering Bob's revealed willingness to pay above $1,100,000.
* **Maintain leverage:** We still haven't dipped below our ""walk-away"" point (selling to John), so we maintain a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. While $1,550,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000.  This price reflects the value I place on the product while respecting my budget limitations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive momentum:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Still below target:** While $1,200,000 is a significant improvement, it's still substantially lower than our desired price point and even our compromise offer.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only 4 rounds left, we need to incentivize Bob to move closer to our acceptable range. Accepting at this stage might signal that we're willing to settle for less."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To demonstrate my commitment to getting this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise that benefits us both."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong but fair stance:**  By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to take this offer seriously.
* **Strategic concession:** We are making a smaller concession this round ($100,000 instead of $100,000+), signaling that we're nearing our limit. 
* **Above the minimum:**  The $1,450,000 price point still provides a substantial profit margin and keeps us well above simply accepting John's offer.
* **Time pressure:** With only three rounds left, Bob will feel the pressure to either accept this strong offer or risk losing the deal altogether."
