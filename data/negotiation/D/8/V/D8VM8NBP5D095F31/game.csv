"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I do recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the worth of what I'm offering. Would you consider $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product holds a lot of value, but I have budgetary constraints. I can move up to $1,100,000. This is a fair offer, considering John can offer me the product right now for $1,000,000.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
