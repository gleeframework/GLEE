"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I value your offer, $125 is a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference at $132.50?  That's a fair price for both of us.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $132.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $127.50. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",127.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $127.50 is still a little low for me. How about we settle on $130?  It's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125, but I'm not sure I can go any lower. Can you meet me at $125?",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $125 is your limit, but it's still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $127.50.  This is my final offer, and if you're not able to accept it, I'll need to move on to another buyer.",127.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer: $122.50. If you can meet me at this price, I'll buy the product from you.",122.5,Bob,8,
