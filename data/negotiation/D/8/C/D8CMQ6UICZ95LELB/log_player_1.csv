Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I value your offer, $125 is a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference at $132.50?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 132.50} 
```"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $127.50 is still a little low for me. How about we settle on $130?  It's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Even though it's close to my minimum, I still have a few rounds left and I want to see if I can get a higher price. I'm determined to get as close to $140 as possible."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand that $125 is your limit, but it's still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $127.50.  This is my final offer, and if you're not able to accept it, I'll need to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 127.5} 
```"

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer: $122.50. If you can meet me at this price, I'll buy the product from you.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, but it's still not quite there. With only two rounds left, I don't want to risk going lower and ending up with a sale below my minimum.  Selling to John for $120 is the best option for me right now."
