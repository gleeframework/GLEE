Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a strong investment opportunity for you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows you to potentially earn an extra $150,000.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The offer price is still significantly below Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) making it attractive.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** There's a chance Bob might counter-offer, opening the door for further negotiation and potentially landing on a price closer to $1,200,000.
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're not losing out, as John is ready to buy at your desired price.

This approach balances risk and reward, aiming to get the best possible price from Bob while having a secure fallback option with John."
