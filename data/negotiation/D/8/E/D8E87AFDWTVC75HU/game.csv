"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $9,000 is still a bit high for me, though. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
