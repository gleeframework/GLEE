Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. If he outright rejects it, you can always come down in price. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you'll get at least $10,000. This allows you to be bolder with your initial offer to Bob."
