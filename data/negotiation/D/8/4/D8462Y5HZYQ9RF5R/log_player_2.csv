"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since the product is worth no more than $120 to me, and Alice's offer is $60, it's definitely worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  I'll reject and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 45}
``` 

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, dropping the price by 25%.  This is a good starting point for negotiation, and I'm hoping Alice will be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $55. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $55
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, and $55 is a good price for me. I'm happy to accept and close the deal."
