{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation if he rejects it.  It also shows you are willing to be flexible.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $95?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite there. I'll counter Bob's offer again, but if he doesn't budge, I'll move on to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm trying to make sure I get a fair deal too.  I can do $90, but that's my final offer.  If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we do $87.50? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $87.50 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to go any lower.  It's time to move on to John and guarantee a sale at my minimum acceptable price."
