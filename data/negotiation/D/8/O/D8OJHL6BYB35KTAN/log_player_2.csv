Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1250000 and $1500000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1375000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my budget.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm concerned that we won't be able to reach an agreement before I run out of rounds. To avoid the risk of losing out on the product entirely, I'll take the guaranteed price from John."
