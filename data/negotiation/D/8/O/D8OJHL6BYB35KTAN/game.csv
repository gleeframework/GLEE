"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $2000000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1000000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1500000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1500000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1250000.  This is my final offer, as it's close to my maximum budget. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1250000 and $1500000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1375000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
