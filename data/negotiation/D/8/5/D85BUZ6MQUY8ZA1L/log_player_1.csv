{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer starts high, giving you room to negotiate.  It also expresses confidence in the product's value, which might make Bob more inclined to seriously consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe the product's value justifies a slightly higher price. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000?  This would allow me to make the sale and still offer you a competitive price."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1350000. How about we try $1275000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is only slightly below my minimum, and it's likely I won't be able to get a higher price from him. It's better to accept his offer than to risk losing the sale altogether or to waste time going back and forth with more counteroffers."
