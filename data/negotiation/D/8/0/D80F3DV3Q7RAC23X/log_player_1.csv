Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it will be highly profitable for you."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $1,450,000 leaves room for negotiation while still potentially securing a significant profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:** The message highlights the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique item"" to justify the high price and appeal to Bob's potential desire for a valuable asset.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, the message implies a willingness to discuss. This allows Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price still above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves some risk. If Bob is unwilling to negotiate and walks away, you'll be left selling to John at the lower price. However, the potential for a much higher profit with Bob makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
