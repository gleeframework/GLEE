Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,500.  I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You have an advantage knowing Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Aiming High, Staying Reasonable:** Starting with $10,500 leaves room for negotiation while securing a significant portion of the potential profit ($12,000 - $8,000 = $4,000).
* **Backup Option:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 ensures you won't be forced to go below your minimum acceptable price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know his value, he might try to negotiate down. Be prepared to counter-offer but avoid going too low.
* **Relationship Building:** The tone of the message is polite and emphasizes mutual benefit, which can lead to a smoother transaction."
