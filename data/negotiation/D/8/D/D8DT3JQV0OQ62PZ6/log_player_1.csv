"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation at my product's full value to me ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while establishing a strong initial position. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" aiming to justify the high asking price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While I'm starting high, I'm open to Bob's counteroffers. This first offer is just the opening move in our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount so early in the process. I believe I can get a better deal by countering his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting $925,000, I'm demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still holding firm on a price significantly higher than Bob's initial offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to reinforce my position that a higher price is justified.
* **Seeking Agreement:** The tone aims to find a mutually agreeable point rather than engage in aggressive back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is inching closer, but it's still a substantial difference from my target. I sense some room for negotiation, especially since we're only in Round 4. I'll counter with a smaller concession to signal I'm looking for a more serious commitment from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000. This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:**  I've reduced my price by $25,000, which is less than my previous reduction. This shows I'm getting closer to my limit but still open to negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value and Confidence:** I'm reinforcing the product's value and expressing confidence that it will meet Bob's needs, aiming to justify the price.
* **Creating Urgency:**  By stating it's a ""very competitive offer,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency for Bob to consider the deal seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and go up to $887,500, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiations:** Bob is sticking stubbornly to small increments and keeps stating ""that's as high as I can go,"" suggesting he's unlikely to move significantly closer to my target.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of losing the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. The potential gains from Bob at this point don't outweigh that risk.
* **Time Value:** Each round spent with Bob is a round I'm not finalizing the sale with John. I'd rather secure the guaranteed profit now."
