"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  My asking price is $950,000. This is a substantial discount, and I'm confident you'll see the tremendous value it brings. Let's schedule a call to discuss further.",950000.0,Alice,1,
