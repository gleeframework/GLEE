Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob, but I'm not afraid to walk away and secure the deal with John."

I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but I still need to be above $1,050,000 to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to compromise and offer $1,062,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1062500}
