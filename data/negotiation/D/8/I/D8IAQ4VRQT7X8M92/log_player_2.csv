# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product.

I'm going to buy the product from John.  Alice's offer is still too high for me, and I'm concerned that we're getting too close to my time limit without a deal.  It's time to secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
