"Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
