This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $250,000 less than John's price and $150,000 less than Alice's initial offer.
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Alice has indicated this is her final offer, suggesting she's unlikely to go lower.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. You risk Alice sticking to her price, leaving you to choose between her offer and John's less favorable one."
