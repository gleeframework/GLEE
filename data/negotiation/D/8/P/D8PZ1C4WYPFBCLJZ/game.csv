"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $105?  I think that's fair for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider $95?,95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $95 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $100? That's my final offer, and it's still a good price for the value of this product.",100.0,Alice,5,
