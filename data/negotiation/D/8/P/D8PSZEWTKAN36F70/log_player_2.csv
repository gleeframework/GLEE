"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We can definitely get a better price than $90. Let's start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $90 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

This counter-offer aims to establish a lower price point, closer to Alice's value of the product. It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can do $85, but that's as low as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate. We're closer to a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $77?"",
""product_price"": 77
}
```

We're proposing a price that's a fair compromise. It shows Alice we're willing to negotiate but also holds firm on getting a reasonable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! I can do $82, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really like the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice seems firm on her price, and $82 is a reasonable deal. It's better to accept now rather than risk the negotiation stalling and ending up with John's $100 offer."
