"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $120 to me. Alice's offer is $60, which is a good price, but there's room for negotiation.  I'll see if I can get it for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 45}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, hoping to get a better price than $60. If Alice is willing to negotiate, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $55. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $55
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $55 is within my budget and a good compromise. It's worth accepting rather than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up paying more or having to buy from John."
