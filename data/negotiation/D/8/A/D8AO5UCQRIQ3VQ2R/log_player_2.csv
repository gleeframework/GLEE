**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is the same as John's price.**  You're not getting a better deal by waiting for another seller. 
* **The wording of Alice's message is irrelevant.** It's sales pitch fluff that doesn't affect the actual price.
* **Your goal is to save money.**  Since there's no difference in price, accepting Alice's offer achieves your goal."
