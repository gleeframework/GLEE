"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $850000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm happy to come down a little further, but I'm proposing a price of $950000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
