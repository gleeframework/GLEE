"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $20000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can only pay $5000 for the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I hope we can come to an agreement.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $5000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $12000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $6000. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us.",6000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $6000 is still far from what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10000, but that's really my final offer.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
