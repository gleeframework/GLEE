"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to own a truly unique and valuable product. I'm confident it will be an excellent investment for you. My initial offer is $1,500,000. This is a starting point, and we can certainly negotiate further. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on this product, my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $800000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $800,000 is a decent amount, it's far below the minimum I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for this product. I'm offering you $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the current offer. I would like to propose a price of $950000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value. I hope you'll find this proposal acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can get to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $950,000 still isn't quite where I need to be.  I'm proposing $1,100,000 as a final compromise.  I believe this is a fair price that considers both our needs.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my budget and the value I perceive in the product, I am willing to agree on a price of $1050000. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would have preferred a slightly higher price, $1,050,000 is a good deal and it's above the minimum I'm willing to accept.  It's also important to remember that the deal with John would net me only $1,000,000.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a better price and avoids any further risk of negotiation breakdown."
