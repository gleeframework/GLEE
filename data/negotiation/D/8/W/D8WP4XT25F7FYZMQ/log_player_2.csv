# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider a lower price closer to $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. How about we settle at $800,000?  That's a fair price and would allow me to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $800,000 is a fair price for you, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a good deal for you. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $950,000. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $800,000 than risk further negotiation with Alice."
