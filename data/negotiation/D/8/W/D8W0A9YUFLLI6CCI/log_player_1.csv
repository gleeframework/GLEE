Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can lower the price a bit in subsequent counteroffers.  However, I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $100, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's offers become too low."
