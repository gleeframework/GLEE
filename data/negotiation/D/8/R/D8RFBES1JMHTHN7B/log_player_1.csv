Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $1,100,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, selling at anything above $800,000 (John's offer) is a win for Alice."
