"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,200,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm confident that I can get at least $1,000,000 from John if I need to, so this is a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept a loss of $200,000.  I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,000,000.  This is still above Bob's initial offer but closer to his perceived value, and it's the minimum I'm willing to accept.  If Bob rejects this, I'll consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer, I'm still not willing to settle for $900,000.  I'll make another counteroffer, but if he rejects it, I'm going to sell to John.  I've lost a lot of time already."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer $950,000. This is a good compromise and gets me closer to my desired price. If he rejects, I'm going to sell to John, because I'm running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a better deal with Bob, and I've already wasted several rounds.  While $925,000 is close to my desired price, I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John and move on."
