"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to buy the product for $120 or less. Alice's initial offer of $170 is far too high.  It's better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to buy the product for $120 or less. This is his ideal price, and while it might be a low starting point, it establishes his maximum willingness to pay.  If Alice rejects, he can still get the product from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $155 is closer to Bob's goal, it's still above his target of $120. He has the option of buying from John for a lower price. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway. This counteroffer is a significant decrease from Alice's last offer, showing Bob's willingness to compromise. If this is rejected, Bob is ready to buy from John."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $145 is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still more expensive than buying from John.  With five rounds left, there's still room to negotiate. Bob is willing to risk a few more rounds to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
```
