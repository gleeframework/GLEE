"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to me, and I believe it has the potential to be equally valuable for your business. My initial offer is $1500000. I'm confident we can find a price that benefits us both. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget. There is no incentive to negotiate further. While there's a chance you could get a lower price from Alice, the risk of a lengthy negotiation and the possibility of Alice walking away outweighs the potential savings. Buying from John guarantees you the product for your maximum price."
