,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is quite high. While I'm interested in the product,  $2,200,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let's see if we can work something out.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your offer, the value of this product to the right buyer is far greater.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you believe this product is valuable, but $1,900,000 is still out of my price range.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,500,000.  I'm ready to finalize the deal at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
