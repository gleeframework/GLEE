"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and your minimum ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This might make Bob more amenable to a price closer to your desired range. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason (""immense potential"") makes the high price seem less arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and invites Bob's perspective, signaling your willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While the initial price is high, successful negotiation could lead to a significantly larger profit than selling to John immediately.
2. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will reveal how eager he is and provide valuable information for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is quite high. While I'm interested in the product,  $2,200,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is higher than his initial valuation, indicating he's willing to negotiate and sees the product's value. However, $1,200,000 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open and allows you to guide the price closer to your target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your offer, the value of this product to the right buyer is far greater.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** Showing appreciation for his offer helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Justification of Value:** Re-emphasizing the product's high value to the ""right buyer"" subtly reminds Bob of its potential and justifies a higher price.
* **Significant Drop, but Above Minimum:**  The price drop from $2,200,000 to $1,900,000 signals flexibility while remaining comfortably above your $1,500,000 floor. This leaves room for further negotiation but pushes towards a more favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe this product is valuable, but $1,900,000 is still out of my price range.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,500,000.  I'm ready to finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met your minimum acceptable price. While you could try to negotiate for more, there's no guarantee of success and you risk pushing him away. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the potential loss of both Bob and John as buyers."
