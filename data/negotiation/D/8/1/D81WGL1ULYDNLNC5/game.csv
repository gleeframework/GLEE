"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $900000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000.  This is a fair price considering I can get it for $1000000 elsewhere.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $750000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $825000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,
