"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low.  It's important to remember that this product is worth significantly more to you than that. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a price closer to my initial offer to make this worthwhile. How about $850,000? That leaves plenty of room for both of us to benefit from this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about $825,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",825000.0,Bob,4,
