"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this one. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $115 for the product. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $110.  If you're serious about selling, I think we can make this work.",110.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $110. I'll try to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $112.50. Can you see your way to that?",112.5,Alice,5,
