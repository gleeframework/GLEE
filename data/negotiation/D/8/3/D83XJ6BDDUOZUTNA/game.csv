"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be interested in! I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest!  While I appreciate your offer, $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $175, which still leaves some room for negotiation. Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $175 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $125. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $150? That's a fair price that lets us both walk away happy. What do you say?",150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135, but that's my final offer.  Let's close this deal and both be happy.",135.0,Bob,6,
