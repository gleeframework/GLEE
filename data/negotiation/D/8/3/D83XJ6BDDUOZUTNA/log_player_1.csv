"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be interested in! I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. $80 is significantly lower than my minimum threshold. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest!  While I appreciate your offer, $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $175, which still leaves some room for negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $175 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $125. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $150? That's a fair price that lets us both walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135, but that's my final offer.  Let's close this deal and both be happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $135 is still below my minimum threshold of $150.  While I would prefer to get closer to my target price, it's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing out entirely.  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a sale at my minimum price."
