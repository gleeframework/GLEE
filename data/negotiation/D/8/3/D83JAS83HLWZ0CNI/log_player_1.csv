Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you.  Given its quality and features, I'm asking for $22,000. What do you think?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is too low. I need to counter, but leaving room for negotiation.

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $19,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, I'm still quite far off from that number.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000 for the product?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $14,000 is closer, my budget is quite firm. I could do $11,000 as my final offer. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
