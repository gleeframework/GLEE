{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, potentially making him more open to negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

This offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation that could lead to a higher price. I am willing to go down to $15,000 if Bob doesn't counteroffer, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I will adjust my counteroffers based on Bob's responses and my assessment of his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I am open to negotiation, accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me. I will reject his offer and try to counteroffer for a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which still reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I am lowering my price to $10,000, which is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer. This shows a willingness to compromise, but it also maintains a substantial margin above my minimum price.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer but reiterate that it's too low. I frame my counteroffer as a reasonable compromise and emphasize the value of the product. 
* **Strategy:** I am hoping that this counteroffer will encourage Bob to increase his bid and move closer to a price that works for both of us. If Bob rejects this offer, I will carefully consider my options, including potentially selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This would allow us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,250 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I believe I can still negotiate a better price, considering my product's worth to me. I will reject Bob's offer and try to counteroffer again, hoping to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,250 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this work. Let's try $9,750.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away with a positive outcome.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I am raising my offer to $9,750, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows a willingness to meet him halfway while still maintaining a price that is closer to my desired value.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's efforts to negotiate, but reaffirm that his offer is still too low. I frame my counteroffer as a compromise that benefits both parties and promotes a positive outcome for both. 
* **Strategy:** I am aiming for a final agreement that is closer to my minimum price of $15,000. This counteroffer demonstrates my flexibility while maintaining a firm stance. If Bob rejects this offer, I might consider accepting his previous offer or selling the product to John."
