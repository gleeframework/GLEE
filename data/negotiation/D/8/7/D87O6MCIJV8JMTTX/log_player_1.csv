Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and the potential returns on investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
