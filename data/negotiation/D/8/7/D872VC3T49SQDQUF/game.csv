"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds immense value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. This price reflects the true potential of the product and the significant returns it can generate for your business.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $2,000,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I can afford. This price reflects the value I see in the product and ensures a win-win for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and the impact it can have on your business. To find a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This price reflects a more accurate assessment of the product's value while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This reflects the value I see in the product, while staying within my budget constraints.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To show you my commitment to making this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a significant concession and a very competitive price for a product with such potential.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $1,550,000 is still a bit high for me, though.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
