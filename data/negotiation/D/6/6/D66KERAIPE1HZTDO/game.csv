"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we begin our negotiation, I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get this product at a discount, and I believe it's a fair starting point. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value of the product, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for it, which is a significant savings for you.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product, and it's a good middle ground.  Let's see if we can find an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
