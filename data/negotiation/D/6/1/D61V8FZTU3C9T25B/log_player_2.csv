# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is highly valued by many of our customers. It's worth more than $100 to us and we believe it could be equally valuable to you. Considering its quality and benefits, I would like to propose a price of $150 for this exclusive item. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget and needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $150 for the product.  Alice is offering it at $150. You have a guaranteed alternative (buying from John for $150). There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer, as you can get the same product for the same price from John."
