"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $1000000 on this product. Would you consider reducing the price to meet my budget?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a bit tight for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I can only go as low as $1100000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950000 for the product. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my financial limits.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $950000. I can see that you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1100000 and $950000. How about $1025000? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to reach a mutually agreeable price. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a final offer of $975000 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations for a fair transaction.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $975000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet in the middle at $1037500? It's a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us.",1037500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my offer. In light of our previous discussions, I am willing to increase my offer to $995000 for the product. This is the highest I can go while still respecting my budget constraints.",995000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $995000 is a fair price for this product. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, which is just $50000 above your previous offer. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",1050000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to offer $985000 for the product. This is the highest I can go while still adhering to my budget constraints.",985000.0,Bob,10,
