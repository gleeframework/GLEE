"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. After reviewing its value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $2,200,000.  I believe this price accurately reflects its long-term worth.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget. Considering my maximum limit and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This offer reflects a fair compromise and allows us to proceed with the deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and my initial assessment. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this revised offer represents a significant concession on my part while still reflecting the inherent value of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, which is a substantial increase from my initial counteroffer. This price reflects a fair value considering my budget and the potential of the product.  Let's find common ground and make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $1,600,000.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your investment.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is closer to my budget, but $1,600,000 is still a stretch. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial deal, as this price reflects the value I see in the product and my ability to invest.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
