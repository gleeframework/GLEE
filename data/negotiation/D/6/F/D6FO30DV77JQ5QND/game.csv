"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price given the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $900,000 is still a touch higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
