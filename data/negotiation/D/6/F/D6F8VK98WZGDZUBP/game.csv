,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $22,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on it.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects what it offers. How about we meet in the middle at $19,000?",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a price that reflects the value of the product, but $19,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to increase my offer to $15,000, which is a significant step closer to your last proposal.  I believe this is a fair compromise.",15000.0,Bob,4,
