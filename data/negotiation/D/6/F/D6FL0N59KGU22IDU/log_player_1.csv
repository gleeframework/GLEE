Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, Alice is still positioned to make significantly more than selling to her fallback option, John ($8,000)."
