"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to go lower to make a sale. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get a better price from Alice."
