Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. What do you think?,150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but would be willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $125 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers at $107.50.  If you're open to that, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $107.50 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to consider it. I'm going to counteroffer at $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.  I'm willing to go up to $110 for the product.  This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with $110. I'm going to counteroffer at $117.50. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",117.5,Alice,7,
