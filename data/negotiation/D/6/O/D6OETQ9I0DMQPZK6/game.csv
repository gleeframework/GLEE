"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's valued at $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment. I'm starting with a price of $950,000. Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to drop my price to $850,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and allows me to get a fair price for this valuable product. Let's close this deal!",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product holds value, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $750,000. Let's meet in the middle - would that price work for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  I'm firm on my price of $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's seal the deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still finding it hard to justify going above $800,000.  That's my final offer.  If it doesn't work for you, I understand, and I might have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
