Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's valued at $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment. I'm starting with a price of $950,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $700,000 is far too low for me, especially since I know the product is worth significantly more to him. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to drop my price to $850,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and allows me to get a fair price for this valuable product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product holds value, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $750,000. Let's meet in the middle - would that price work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is closer to what I want, I'm still not satisfied. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  I'll counter with that again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  I'm firm on my price of $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still finding it hard to justify going above $800,000.  That's my final offer.  If it doesn't work for you, I understand, and I might have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is $800,000. This is the same price John is offering. While I'd love to get more from Bob, I don't want to risk losing out on a sale.  I'm going to accept John's offer and sell to him."
