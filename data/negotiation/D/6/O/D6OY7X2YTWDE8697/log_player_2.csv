You should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal compared to its value to her, you can still try to get a better price. You know John is willing to sell for $1,200,000, so you have room to negotiate with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still find this a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is a good deal for you. It's lower than her initial offer and still well within your budget.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely you won't get much lower than this.  Accepting her offer is the best way to secure the product while saving a significant amount of money."
