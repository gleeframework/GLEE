Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, as I know it would be of great value to you.  I'm asking for $14,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential worth. "",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so aiming close to that maximizes your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting slightly below his maximum allows for potential haggling, should Bob try to negotiate a lower price.
* **High Anchor:**  A high initial offer sets an anchor point for the negotiation. Even if Bob counter-offers, it's likely to be closer to your initial price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be forced to accept anything less than $8,000."
