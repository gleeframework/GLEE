"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it'll bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. He wants to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows him to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $9,500?  That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to my budget. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between Alice's asking price and his budget. Offering $9,500 is a significant reduction from $11,000, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate. This price still allows Alice to make a profit, making it a reasonable counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a competitive price that reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $10,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his target. He's willing to continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his ideal price point."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit stretched at that price.  Let's try $10,000.  It's a fair deal for both of us, and I'm ready to close today."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price, but he's still cautious.  This offer of $10,000 shows he's willing to compromise while still keeping in mind his budget.  The message emphasizes his readiness to close the deal, hoping to incentivize Alice to accept."
