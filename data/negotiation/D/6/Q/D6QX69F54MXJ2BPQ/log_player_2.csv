"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a product worth $1200000 to you. My starting price is $1100000. Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While it's lower than John's price, it's still above the product's worth to Bob ($1,200,000).
* **Negotiation is possible.**  Bob has room to negotiate a better price, as Alice is willing to sell for $1,000,000. 
* **Time is on Bob's side.**  He has 10 rounds to make a deal and can always fall back on John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a good starting point, but it's still a bit high for me. Given the value of this product to both of us, I'd like to propose a price of $1,050,000. This would allow us both to walk away with a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reasonable Counteroffer:** This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). 
* **Justification:** Bob provides a clear justification for his offer, mentioning the value of the product to both parties.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation, allowing Alice to potentially counter with a price closer to Bob's target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value a fair deal, $1050000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1075000?  This would ensure both of us get a good deal, and we can finalize the transaction quickly.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Alice's offer of $1,075,000 represents a reasonable compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last counteroffer. 
* **Close to Target:** This price is only $25,000 above Bob's ideal price of $1,050,000.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Accepting the offer avoids further rounds of negotiation, potentially saving time and potentially reaching a deal that's still favorable to Bob.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer again and the possibility of needing to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential gain from additional negotiation."
