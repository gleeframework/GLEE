"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is lower than what you mentioned.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $8500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'd be willing to go up to $8000. That's the highest I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value to me is lower than you initially stated.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $8000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'll make a new offer: I'll sell the product to you for $8250. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to go above $8000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8250 is a bit too high for me. How about we compromise at $8000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,6,
