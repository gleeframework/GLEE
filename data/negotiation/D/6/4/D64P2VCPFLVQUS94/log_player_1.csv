Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. It's clear this product holds significant value for both of us.  While I'm aiming higher, how about we meet closer to the middle at $1,350,000?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $1,200,000 again? I'm really interested in making a deal, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

While I could push for more, Bob is firm at $1,200,000 and that's a $200,000 profit. It's not worth the risk of him walking away and getting only $1,000,000 from John."
