"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to start with an offer of $15,000 for the product. I'm confident that you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. You should definitely counter-offer, aiming to get much closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15,000 is quite high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000."", 
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your ideal target. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that you're looking for a good deal.
* **Significant Difference:** By countering with $8,000, you're aiming to significantly lower the asking price. This shows Alice you're serious but also willing to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room:** While $8,000 is your initial offer, it allows space to gradually increase your bid if Alice completely rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell the product for. I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down, but her offer is still above your maximum and John's price. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting, you signal that you're looking for a price closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute limit."", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up, Setting a Limit:**  You're showing flexibility by increasing your offer from $8,000 to $9,000. However, you're also setting a firm boundary by stating it's your absolute limit. 
* **Staying Below John's Price:** It's essential to keep your counteroffers below what John is offering. This gives you leverage and keeps your options open.
* **Encouraging Compromise:** By making a counteroffer close to your limit, you signal to Alice that a deal is possible if she's willing to compromise further."
