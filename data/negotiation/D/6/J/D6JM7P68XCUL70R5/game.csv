"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $135? That feels like a fair compromise.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 was a bit too high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit far from your offer of $135. I'm willing to make another compromise. I can sell the product to you for $145. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,
