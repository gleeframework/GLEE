"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality item that you've been eyeing. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to negotiate a lower price, closer to my $150 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($120) to leave room for negotiation and signal that $180 is unacceptable.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is courteous but clearly states my price limit. 
* **Aiming for a Deal:** My goal is to get the product for a price that works for me, ideally well below $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down in price, $160 is still above my $150 limit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to negotiate suggests I might be able to get the price lower.
* **John as Backup:**  I'll continue negotiating but keep in mind that I can always buy from John for $150 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $135? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** I'm raising my offer from $120 to $135, showing willingness to move but not too drastically.
* **Compromise Language:**  Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" reinforces the idea of finding a mutually beneficial price.
* **Targeting Below $150:**  My goal remains to buy the product for less than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $160 was a bit too high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit far from your offer of $135. I'm willing to make another compromise. I can sell the product to you for $145. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $145 is only slightly above my ideal price and a good deal compared to John's offer of $150.
* **Risk of Losing Out:** Continuing to negotiate could backfire. Alice might not go any lower, and I'd miss out on a decent price.
* **Time is Valuable:**  Dragging out the negotiation further isn't worth the potential for saving a few dollars."
