"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price, considering its worth to both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us and gives me room to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still gives you a significant profit margin, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $800,000 for the product. This offers a good compromise and a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your offer, but $800,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a fair compromise and ensures we both walk away with a good outcome. Let's finalize this.",850000.0,Alice,5,
