Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a price that is still above my minimum threshold of $15,000 but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more.  I'm confident John will buy it for $15,000 if this negotiation fails, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $14,000. This is still a good price for Bob as it is above his initial offer, but it is closer to my minimum threshold of $15,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and leaves room for a potential agreement."
