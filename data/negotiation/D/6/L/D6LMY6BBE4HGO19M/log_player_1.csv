Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.  I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Value, Limited Buyers:**  The product has a high value to both you and Bob.  You also have a guaranteed buyer in John. This puts you in a strong negotiating position.
* **Testing the Waters:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value allows you to gauge his eagerness and potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can then decide to accept, reject, or continue bargaining. 
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything and can confidently sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
