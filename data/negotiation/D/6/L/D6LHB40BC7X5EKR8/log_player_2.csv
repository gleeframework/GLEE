Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering the value it brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $16,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.
