"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire [product name] for a price of $1,700,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I believe it's a compelling offer for you, given the potential you see in this product.  I understand its worth $800,000 to you, so this price allows for a substantial profit margin.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further details.  If you decline, I'll be selling it to John for $1,500,000, so this is your chance to secure it at a lower price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.
