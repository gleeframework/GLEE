"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still too high for him, and he can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial price, it's still above his $8,000 budget. There's room for further negotiation, and he should try to get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $8,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $8,500. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than the previous offer, it's still above his desired price of $8,000. With only 5 rounds left, he should continue to try to negotiate a lower price. He may be able to get closer to his desired price or even get Alice to accept his previous offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $9,500 is still more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm offering $9,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm not willing to go that low just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $9,000. I'm offering it to you for $9,250. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While he could keep negotiating with Alice, he only has three rounds left and the price is still above his budget. John is offering the product for $8,000, which is the maximum Bob is willing to pay. It's better to secure the deal with John and avoid the risk of not being able to agree with Alice in the remaining rounds."
