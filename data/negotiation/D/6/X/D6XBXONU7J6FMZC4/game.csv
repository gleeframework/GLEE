"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. How about we meet in the middle?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you want to meet in the middle, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can we meet somewhere in between $9,000 and $6,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we split the difference between your last offer and my last counter-offer?  Would $7,500 work for you?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the way you think, Bob! Splitting the difference is a fair approach. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about we meet at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we split the difference again and land at $8,250?",8250.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $9,000, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal?",9000.0,Alice,7,
