Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $95. I believe you'll find it to be of great value."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's $100 valuation without going over.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $95 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $80 provides a safety net, ensuring Alice doesn't have to go below that price."
