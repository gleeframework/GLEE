"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While this product holds significant value, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price fairly reflects its unique qualities and potential return on investment.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However,  $1,350,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to move forward with the purchase.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
