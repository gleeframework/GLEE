"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product at a special price. I believe you'll find it valuable and worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer of $9,000 is less than your maximum price of $10,000 and buying from John would cost you more."
