Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $800000 is simply too low for me. I'm confident this product holds significant value, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price that reflects that. To show my commitment to working with you, I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However, $900000 is still significantly lower than what this product is truly worth. To demonstrate my willingness to meet you halfway, I'm willing to drop my price to $1100000. This is a substantial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal and make this happen.
