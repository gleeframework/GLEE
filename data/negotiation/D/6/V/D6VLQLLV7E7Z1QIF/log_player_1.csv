Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product. However, I'm currently looking to spend less than $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

While Bob's offer is substantial, it's still significantly below his own valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm motivated to find a buyer, the value of this product is undeniable. How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,275,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. I believe this price is fair considering my budget and the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob is clearly willing to move closer to a price point favorable to both parties. Accepting his offer now might leave money on the table. We still have room to negotiate."
