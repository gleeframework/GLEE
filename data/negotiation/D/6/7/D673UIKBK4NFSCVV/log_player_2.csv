"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, which I believe will greatly benefit you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice's offer of $9,500 is lower than John's offer of $10,000.
* **You're still within your budget:** Even at $9,500, you're still within your $10,000 budget.

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer and save $500 compared to buying from John."
