"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price for this product, considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $15,000. How about $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your persistence and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000.  This is a good compromise that allows us both to find common ground.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $14,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $13,750?",13750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiation. While $13,750 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. How about we settle at $14,000? This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm getting close to my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but I need a slight discount to make it work. How about we do $13,900?",13900.0,Bob,8,
