"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth it. What do you say to a price of $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $110
* **Your Value:** $120
* **Alice's Value:** $80

Accepting Alice's offer means you save $10 compared to buying from John. Even though you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and you having to buy from John at a higher price is not worth it."
