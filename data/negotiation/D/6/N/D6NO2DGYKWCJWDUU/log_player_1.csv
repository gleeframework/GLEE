"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, aiming to get as much as possible.
* **Fairness Justification:** I'm not just throwing out a random number. I'm using a ""fairness"" argument to make my offer seem more reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with a question, encouraging Bob to engage and potentially start a counteroffer. 

**Important Notes:**

* I don't know Bob's valuation, so I'm starting with a significant markup.
* I'm leaving room for negotiation to encourage a deal. 
* This is a risky strategy, but with 10 rounds, I have time to explore options and adjust my approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.** I need to at least get $1,500,000 to make this worthwhile. 
* **I have 8 rounds left.** This gives me time to negotiate and potentially get a better price.
* **Selling to John guarantees my minimum.**  However, I'm hoping to earn more than $1,500,000.

**Next Step:**

In the next round, I'll need to send a counteroffer that's more palatable than Bob's initial offer but still above my minimum. I'll likely need to compromise, but I'll try to keep the price as high as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is significantly lower than what I need to sell, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. I'll offer the product for $1,750,000. This reflects the unique value it holds and is still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's low offer but not giving in completely.
* **Middle Ground:** The counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial price but still comfortably above my minimum.  
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product again to justify the price. 

**Strategy:**

This round is crucial. I need to strike a balance between being flexible and maintaining my desired profit margin. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to move closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1750000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1400000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Final Offer:** While Bob claims this is his final offer, I can't be sure.  There's still room for negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a Safe Option:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 guarantees my minimum.  However, I'm still hopeful I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will need to counter Bob's offer. 
* **Higher Than Minimum:** I'll aim for a price higher than $1,500,000, but I will need to be more flexible to reach an agreement.
* **Focus on Compromise:** I will emphasize that I'm willing to meet in the middle. 

**Important Note:**

I need to be careful not to push Bob away entirely. I need to find a balance between holding firm on my minimum and making a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm dropping my price again, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Minimum Met:** My new offer is slightly above my minimum price, ensuring I still get a profit.
* **Focus on Agreement:**  I'm using language that emphasizes a desire to reach a mutually acceptable solution.

**Strategy:**

With only 5 rounds left, I need to make a deal soon. This offer is a significant compromise, but it's still within my acceptable range. I'm hoping that Bob sees this as a genuine attempt to reach an agreement and will accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1550000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1300000. This is my best and final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Best and Final Offer:**  While Bob claims this is his final offer, I'm not convinced. However, we're running out of time, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're down to 4 rounds.  The longer we negotiate, the more likely Bob is to walk away, and I'm not confident I can get him to budge.

**Selling to John:**

While I'd prefer to get more, selling to John at $1,500,000 guarantees my minimum profit and secures a sale. This is the safest option at this point."
