Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with my ideal price, knowing it's above Bob's perceived value.  This sets the stage for negotiation.  I'm also trying to be positive and encourage Bob to see the value in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can we meet in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. While he's interested, I'm not willing to sell for less than $100, as I have a guaranteed sale with John for that price. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $70 is too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90? This is still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $90 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75, and that's as low as I can go. Can we meet at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating,  I'm not confident of getting a better price from Bob.  Since I have a guaranteed sale with John for $100, it's in my best interest to take that deal and avoid further negotiation."
