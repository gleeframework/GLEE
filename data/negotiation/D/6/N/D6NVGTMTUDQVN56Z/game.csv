"Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $15000 to me, but I'm open to negotiation. I'd like to offer it to you for $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12000 is a bit too low for me, as I value it significantly higher.  However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $17000? It's a fair price that reflects both of our needs.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $17000 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $14000? I'm really interested in the product and willing to negotiate further.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14000 is closer to my minimum, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go down to $15500. This would be a good deal for both of us, and it's a price I can realistically accept.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but I still need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $13500? I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious commitment to buying the product if we can agree on this price.",13500.0,Bob,6,
