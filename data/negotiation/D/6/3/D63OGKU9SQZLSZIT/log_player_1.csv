Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a rare opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I can afford to be ambitious with my initial offer to Bob. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This high price point allows me to gauge Bob's level of interest and potentially secure a significant profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, it opens the door for negotiation. I can always lower the price, knowing my minimum is already met."
