# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering and negotiating further.  $1,400,000 is still above his maximum budget of $1,200,000."

# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if he can get the price down even more."

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $1,200,000.  Alice is offering $1,290,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget.  While there's a chance Alice might come down further, the risk of further negotiation isn't worth it. John's offer guarantees Bob the product at his desired price point."
