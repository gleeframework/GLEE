"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,250,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000.  This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. What do you think?",1280000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,280,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $1,290,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?",1290000.0,Alice,5,
