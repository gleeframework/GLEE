"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $17,000 is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $14,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $16,000? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $15,500. Can you consider that?",15500.0,Bob,4,
