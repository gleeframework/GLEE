"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth more than that to me, but I'm willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,200,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $850,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than what the product is worth to him, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to find a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is a valuable product to you, but I'm still firm on my offer of $850,000.  I'm not able to go any higher. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that he's not willing to go above $850,000. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of reaching a deal with him at an unacceptable price is high.  John is offering a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is my minimum threshold. It's more prudent to secure the sale with John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
