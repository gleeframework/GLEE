"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

It's better to try and get a lower price from Alice.  $115 is still too high, even though it's lower than John's price. There's a good chance Alice will accept a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it's still above her minimum acceptable price.  It should show Alice that you're serious about buying the product while also leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is within my acceptable range.  It's still a better deal than buying from John."
