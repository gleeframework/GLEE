"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, you can likely get it lower.  Since you have 10 rounds and the product is worth $150 to you, there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $100. Would you be open to that? "", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts with a polite acknowledgement of Alice's offer, but then firmly states your target price point. You're aiming for a significant reduction while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and while $110 is a good price, you can likely get it lower. Since you have more rounds, you can continue to push for your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. Let's try $105. That's still a good deal for both of us, and we can close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing you are willing to budge. $105 is closer to Alice's $110, but still under your $100 target. It also emphasizes a quick close, adding a touch of urgency."
