"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant value for you and still allows me to make a decent profit. Please let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer who is also keen on purchasing it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

You can get the product from John for $1,200,000, which is lower than Alice's offer. It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
