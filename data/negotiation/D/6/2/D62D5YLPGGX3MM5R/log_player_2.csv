"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still a significant amount. There's potential to negotiate a better price, especially since Alice values the product at $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore lower prices through counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a price closer to Alice's perceived value. A $100,000 reduction shows a willingness to negotiate while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than her perceived value of the product.  It's worth continuing to negotiate.  By rejecting the offer, I can try to lower the price further through counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate. I'm increasing my offer by $50,000, demonstrating a genuine interest in purchasing the product while still pushing for a price closer to my target. This counteroffer is a compromise that could potentially lead to a successful agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, but at $1,400,000, it's still too high.  The negotiation seems to be moving slowly and it's unlikely I'll be able to get a significantly lower price. Buying from John at $1,500,000 is still within my budget, and it's a more secure option than continuing to haggle with Alice, who may not be willing to meet my desired price."
