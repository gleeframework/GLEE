Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price of $15,000.  Bob is already showing interest, so it's worth continuing the negotiation."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer.  I can potentially get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. How about we try to get closer to my target price of $9000? I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9500. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm still too far from my target price of $15,000.  I think I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate.  It's getting a bit risky, though, with only four rounds remaining.  I'm going to have to be careful."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference again and I offer you the product for $10,000?

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but I think that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'd be happy to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, and Bob's offer still significantly lower than my target price, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my desired outcome and minimizes the risk of ending up with a lower price.  It's time to take the secure option."
