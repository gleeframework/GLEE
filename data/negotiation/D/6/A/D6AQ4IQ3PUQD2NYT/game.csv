"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're firm on the price, Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about we settle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $75. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $84. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",84.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price, but $84 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm afraid if we can't agree on something closer to $70, I might have to consider other options. Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",70.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $81. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise. I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",81.0,Alice,7,
