"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay a maximum of $15,000, and she's asking for $12,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting allows for a counteroffer.** This gives you the opportunity to get a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** You should only do this if you can't get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and willing to compromise. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While this offer is close to Alice's minimum acceptable price, there's still some room for her to counter if she wants to close the deal. 
* **Minimizing risk:** It's better to start with a lower offer and work upwards than to start too high and risk losing the deal or having to settle for a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has lowered her price.**  Her offer of $11,500 is significantly closer to my ideal price range. 
* **Time is a factor.**  While I could continue to try and negotiate a lower price, there's a chance that Alice will become less flexible or even withdraw her offer entirely.
* **John's offer is still a backup.** I can still go to John if I need to, but at this point, Alice's offer is reasonable."
