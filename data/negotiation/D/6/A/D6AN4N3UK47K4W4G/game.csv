"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and opens the door for a mutually beneficial deal.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $1,100,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe the true value of this product sits higher.  Would you consider $1,225,000? This allows us both to benefit significantly from this deal.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,150,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  It seems we're getting closer. How about we split the difference between our last two proposals and settle on $1,187,500? I believe this represents a fair and mutually beneficial agreement.",1187500.0,Alice,5,
