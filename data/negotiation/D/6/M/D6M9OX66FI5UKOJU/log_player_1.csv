"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,500,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and what his initial reaction is. If he rejects, we can then start to gauge his value and negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still do better.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still gives me a decent profit.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I need to start considering John's offer,  $1,300,000 is too far below my minimum value. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,600,000. This is a further compromise, but I'm still holding firm on getting at least a small profit.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and realizes he needs to increase his offer.  I'm starting to get worried about John's offer, so I'm going to try and close this deal soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is too low. I'm starting to run out of time and I'm concerned that I might not be able to get a better offer from Bob. To avoid risking losing out completely, I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $1,500,000."
