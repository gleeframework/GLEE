"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something that I believe is worth at least $12,000, and I know it would be equally valuable for you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum price and higher than John's price. You can get a better deal by rejecting her offer and going with John."
