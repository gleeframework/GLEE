"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $13000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a lower price by negotiating with Alice or buying from John for $15,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $12800. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  The price is now within his budget, and while he could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower.  Buying from John for $15,000 would cost him more."
