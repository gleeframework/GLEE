"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $8,250. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $8,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal today.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $8,100. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me here.",8100.0,Alice,5,
