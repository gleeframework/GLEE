"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $800,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $600,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering its value to you is $800,000.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm not willing to go below $900,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me is $1,500,000.",850000.0,Alice,5,
