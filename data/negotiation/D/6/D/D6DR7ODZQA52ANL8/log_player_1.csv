{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's a good value for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

This offer starts at a high price, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It also frames the offer as a win-win scenario, which can be persuasive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable going.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it would be a great price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $10,500 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, as it's lower than my original offer, and it's closer to your budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
