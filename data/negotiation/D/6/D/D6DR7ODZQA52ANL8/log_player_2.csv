"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's a good value for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum price point of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable going.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it would be a great price for me."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, as it's lower than my original offer, and it's closer to your budget.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is still above your maximum price point of $10,000. At this point, it's more financially beneficial to buy the product from John for $10,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice might get you a lower price, but there's no guarantee, and you risk wasting time and potentially missing out on a good deal."
