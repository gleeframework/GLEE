"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable going.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it would be a great price for me.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, as it's lower than my original offer, and it's closer to your budget.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
