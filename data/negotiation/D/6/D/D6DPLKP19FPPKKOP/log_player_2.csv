"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You value the product at $100, and Alice is offering it for $90. While this is a good deal, it's still more than what you're willing to pay. You can get the product from John for $100, which is your maximum price.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option to save money."
