"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $150 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to find something within my budget. Could you consider reducing the price to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $150.  Bob's offer is too low, and rejecting it allows me to counter and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While $120 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $135. This would give me some room to cover my costs and still allow you to get a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate the offer, but I'm still hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to reduce the price further to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $125 is only $5 away from my minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's a good compromise, and I want to avoid risking a further negotiation that could drag out the process or lead to me selling to John for the minimum price."
