"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  I know you're interested and this is a price that allows you to make a profit.  Let me know if you'd like to proceed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than her product's worth to her, you know you can get a better deal from John. Buying from John for $1,000,000 saves you $100,000, which is the best outcome for you."
