Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, her guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, while still ensuring Alice makes a significant profit.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties (even if John is the only one) can incentivize Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with a realistic chance of Bob accepting the offer."
