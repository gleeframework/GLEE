"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to offer it to you at a competitive price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than her product's worth to her ($800,000). There's significant room for negotiation, and it's worthwhile to try and get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows us to make a counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to our desired price, $900,000 is still higher than what we're comfortable paying. There's still room to negotiate and potentially find a price closer to $850,000.  We'll reject this offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. I'm prepared to offer $875,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to you while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to make a compromise. I'm willing to offer it to you for $920,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above our desired price, but we're getting closer to a deal. There's still room to negotiate and potentially get a price closer to $875,000. We'll reject this offer and continue negotiating. We're also nearing the middle ground, which suggests that Alice is becoming more flexible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While I see the value of this product, $920,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $895,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can come to an agreement. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 895000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to reach a fair agreement, but I'm still not willing to go below $915,000. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to offer it to you for $910,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to our desired price, but $910,000 is still too high. It's worth pushing for a lower price, especially since we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  We'll reject this offer and continue negotiating to see if we can get Alice to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close to an agreement. I'm still not quite comfortable with $910,000, but I'm willing to go a little higher. How about $905,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us and allow us to finalize this deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 905000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go below $915,000. I think this is the final stretch, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $912,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're running out of rounds, and while $912,000 is still higher than what we initially hoped for, it's a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer and a price we can comfortably afford. Accepting this offer allows us to secure the product without risking losing it to another seller, especially considering the cost of buying from John.  It's also likely that Alice is unlikely to budge further with only one round remaining."
