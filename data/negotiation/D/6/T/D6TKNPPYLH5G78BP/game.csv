"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to offer it to you at a competitive price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. I'm prepared to offer $875,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to you while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's work together to make this happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to make a compromise. I'm willing to offer it to you for $920,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While I see the value of this product, $920,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $895,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can come to an agreement. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",895000.0,Bob,6,
