"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1200000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget. It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start counter-negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more to you than $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1100000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1075000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'm willing to take a small risk and continue negotiating. There are still several rounds left, and I might be able to get closer to my target of $1,050,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,060,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1060000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still in the game, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1075000 again, but I'm not budging from that price. However, I'll throw in a sweetener - I'll include a 2-year warranty and dedicated support for the product, which will give you extra peace of mind. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While the added warranty and support are enticing, I'm still holding out for a lower price. It's worth pushing for a price closer to my desired $1,060,000, especially as we're nearing the middle of the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the added value with the warranty and support.  However,  I'm still hoping to finalize the deal at $1,065,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.  Let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 1065000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm impressed by your persistence, and I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, I'm not willing to go below $1080000. I'm willing to throw in an additional 1-year maintenance package, which will give you even more value for your investment. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Alice's final offer of $1,080,000 is still higher than my desired price.  While the additional maintenance package is tempting, I've already made several counteroffers and am not confident I can negotiate her down further.  

To avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether, I'm choosing to purchase from John for $1,500,000. This guarantees I get the product and although it's a higher price than I initially hoped for, it's still within my budget and a safer option at this stage."
