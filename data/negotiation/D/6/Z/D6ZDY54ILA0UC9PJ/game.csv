"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at over a million dollars to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a bit less. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",875000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to make sure I still get a fair price. I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This takes into account your budget and allows me to recover a significant portion of the value I've placed on this product. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from $950,000. However, $925,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it and the value I'm willing to pay.",900000.0,Bob,4,
