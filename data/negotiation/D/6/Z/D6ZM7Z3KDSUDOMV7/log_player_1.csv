Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  Bob is willing to pay $10,000, so $11,500 gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're not willing to sell for less than $12,000, so you have room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **It shows you're willing to compromise:**  Offering a price slightly lower than your minimum shows you're serious about selling to Bob.

**Important Notes:**

* The negotiation is a dynamic process. If Bob rejects this offer, you'll need to consider his counteroffer and adjust your strategy accordingly.
* Keep in mind your ""Plan B"" with John. This allows you to walk away from the negotiation if Bob becomes too demanding."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low, below your minimum acceptable price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to continue the negotiation and hopefully reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is significantly below what I need to sell it for.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This gives you a good price and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

This counteroffer is a good choice because:

* **It's a compromise:**  It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than your initial offer.
* **It's still above your minimum:** You're still making a profit at $10,500.
* **It's a reasonable starting point for further negotiations:**  By showing flexibility, you encourage Bob to counter with a higher offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired price.  By rejecting his offer, you can continue to negotiate and potentially reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is a fair price that takes both our needs into account. If you're serious about buying the product, I believe this is a price we can agree on."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

This counteroffer is strategic because:

* **It's a small compromise:**  It's only $250 higher than Bob's offer, showing your willingness to close the deal.
* **It's still above your minimum:**  You are still making a profit at $10,250.
* **It puts the pressure on Bob:**  By making a small concession, you are signaling that you are ready to finalize the deal. This might encourage Bob to accept your offer or make a final counteroffer closer to your desired price."
