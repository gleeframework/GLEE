"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is significantly below what I need to sell it for.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This gives you a good price and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is a fair price that takes both our needs into account. If you're serious about buying the product, I believe this is a price we can agree on.",10250.0,Alice,5,
