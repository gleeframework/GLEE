I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $85. While it's above my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $95. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $87.5. While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise and significantly better than selling to John for $80."
