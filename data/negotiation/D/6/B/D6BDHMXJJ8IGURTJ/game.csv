Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.,900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. Could you consider offering the product for $750000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm afraid I can't accept it. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $825000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $825000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer it to you for $815000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",815000.0,Alice,5,
