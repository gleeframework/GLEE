# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. By rejecting this offer, you can move to purchase from John at a much better price."
