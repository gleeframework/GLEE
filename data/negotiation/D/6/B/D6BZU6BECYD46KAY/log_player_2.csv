"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $120.  It's better to reject and see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $120. Would you be willing to come down to $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can do $145, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $145 is closer to your budget, it's still over your limit of $120.  It's worth trying to negotiate further, especially since Alice has indicated she's willing to make concessions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $145 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $135.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to make the purchase."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're serious about buying the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to negotiate, so I'll meet you at $140. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is still above my maximum budget of $120.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I've already rejected two counteroffers, and it's possible Alice might not budge further.  It's best to secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with by buying from John."
