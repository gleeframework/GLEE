Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 is a good starting point. It's a price that's above Bob's perceived value ($120) but might still be tempting enough for him to consider. 
* **Limited Time:**  Adding a sense of urgency (""limited time"") might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Why this strategy is better than offering a lower price:**

* **Leaving Money on the Table:** Offering the product for $120 or slightly above leaves potential profit on the table. You know you have a guaranteed sale at a higher price. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting higher gives you some room to negotiate if Bob counters your offer.  

Let's see how Bob responds!"
