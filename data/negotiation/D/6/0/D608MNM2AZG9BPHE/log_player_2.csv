"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, as I know it would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product.
* Alice is offering the product for $9,500. 
* You can get the product from John for $10,000, which is your maximum price. 

Therefore, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John for a slightly higher price."
