"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,600,000 represents its true value, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This allows us to share the benefit of this excellent opportunity.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,200,000. This is a significant amount for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. If you're open to this, we can finalize the deal. ",1200000.0,Bob,4,
