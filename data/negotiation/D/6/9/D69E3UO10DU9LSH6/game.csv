"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the market value, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,500. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,3,
