"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $150. This is still higher than his offer but lower than my initial offer, signaling my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price, there's no guarantee of success and I risk losing the deal completely.  Accepting his offer ensures I get the minimum I'm willing to accept."
