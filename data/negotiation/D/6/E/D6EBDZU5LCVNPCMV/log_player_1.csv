This offer starts at a price that is a good midpoint between your minimum and Bob's perceived value. It also leaves room for negotiation, signaling that you're open to finding a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counteroffer at $8,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its true value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price that considers both our interests. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I must stick to my valuation of the product. I would like to counteroffer at $8,500 for the product. This is the highest I can go while still considering the true value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and closer to your desired price. Accepting this offer ensures a sale with a decent profit."
