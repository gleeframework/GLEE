"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This price would allow us both to make a good profit. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
