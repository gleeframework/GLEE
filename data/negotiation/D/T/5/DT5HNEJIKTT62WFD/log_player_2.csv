"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price range.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This price would allow us both to make a good profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,025,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's within his budget and significantly lower than John's asking price of $1,200,000. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a favorable price."
