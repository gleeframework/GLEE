Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is more than what Bob thinks the product is worth, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $9,500 is still above your minimum of $10,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still adjust the price if necessary, but starting with a reasonable offer is key."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum goal of $10,000. I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this deal work. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you at $8,750. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both live with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750.

While I'm tempted to try and squeeze a bit more out of Bob, the negotiations are becoming lengthy and I'm getting closer to my minimum goal with John's offer. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John to ensure I get at least $10,000."
