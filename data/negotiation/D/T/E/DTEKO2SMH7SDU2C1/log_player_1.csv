Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm going to start with my minimum price. While I know the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, I'm aiming for the full $12,000. If he rejects this, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get my full asking price, Bob's offer is very close and it's likely he won't go any higher. I don't want to risk losing this sale and having to sell to John."
