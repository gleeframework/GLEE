""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal where we both benefit significantly."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, Bob values it at $1,500,000.  This presents an opportunity for a much higher profit margin.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves a substantial profit margin for Alice (above her minimum) while still being very attractive to Bob (saving him $100,000 compared to his own valuation).
* **Negotiation Room:** This price provides some room for negotiation if Bob counters. Alice can potentially lower the price slightly and still remain well above her minimum acceptable price.

By starting with a strong but not unreasonably high offer, Alice increases her chances of securing a deal with Bob and maximizing her profit."
