You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is the same price as buying from John.**  This means there's no advantage to buying from Alice.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the option open to negotiate with her further or explore other possibilities.**  You might be able to get a better deal from Alice if you counter-offer or if she becomes more motivated to sell."
