"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This reflects the product's worth and represents a fair deal for both of us.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway between our last offers at $1,087,500. This price would still be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1087500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but that price doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,131,250.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1131250.0,Alice,5,
