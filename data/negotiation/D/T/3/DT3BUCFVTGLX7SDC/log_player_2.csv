"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $20,000 is way above my budget of $10,000. It's not even close to the value I'm willing to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $20,000 is quite a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go above $12,000 right now. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. I'm also expressing my genuine interest in the product to encourage Alice to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is quite low, but I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This product is truly top-notch and offers significant value.  I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further and see if we can reach a price closer to my budget.  John's offer is still a good backup option if we can't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you believe this product is top-notch, and I'm still very interested. However, $17,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still sticking to my budget constraints. By stating it's my ""absolute maximum,"" I'm putting pressure on Alice to consider my offer seriously."
