Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since I don't know the value of the product to him, I'll aim to get as close to my minimum price of $8,000 as possible. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 9,500}

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also leaving some room for negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
