"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think it would be a good fit for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good deal compared to John's price, it's still above your desired maximum of $150.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $140 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $125.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $132.50?  That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $132.50 is within my budget of $150 and is a good compromise from her previous offer.  It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and potentially getting stuck with a higher price from John."
