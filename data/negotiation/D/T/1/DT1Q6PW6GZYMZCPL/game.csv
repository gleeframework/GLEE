"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $600,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still gives us both a good deal and allows me to recoup a significant portion of my investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you. While I'm open to negotiation, $750,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $850,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement at this price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
