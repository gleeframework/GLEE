Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you. While I'm open to negotiation, $750,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $850,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement at this price.

It's time to cut the negotiation with Alice.  While she might go down a little more, it's unlikely she'll reach $800,000. You have a guaranteed option with John at that price, making it the most financially sensible choice."
