Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $19,000, but considering its potential benefits, I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin by setting the price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($19,000 vs. $10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially securing a price closer to our desired amount.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly mentions openness to discussion, indicating flexibility on price and increasing the likelihood of Bob engaging in a counter-offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** Emphasizing the product's benefits to Bob aims to justify the high price and potentially shift his perceived value closer to ours. 
* **Backup Plan:**  We know John will buy the product for $15,000, guaranteeing us a decent profit even if Bob declines. This allows us to be more confident in our initial high offer.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However,  a very high initial offer might discourage Bob from further negotiation.  Observing his reaction and adapting the approach in subsequent messages will be crucial for a successful deal."
