"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $200 is a bit outside my budget.  How about $150?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was really hoping to get a bit closer to the original price I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $175?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $160, which is closer to my budget.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $160 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $170. How about we meet at $170? I'm willing to compromise a bit to make the deal work.",170.0,Alice,5,
