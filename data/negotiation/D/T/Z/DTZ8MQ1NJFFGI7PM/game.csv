"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $900,000 to make this deal work. This is a significant investment for me, and I'm confident the product will be worth it to you. Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",875000.0,Bob,4,
