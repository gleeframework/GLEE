Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $150, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $150, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and highlights the product's value to pique Bob's interest.
* **Room for negotiation:**  The message makes it clear that I'm open to discussing the price. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! I've successfully sold the product.
* If Bob rejects: I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counter-offer myself. 
* If the negotiation stalls:  I'll always have the option to sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to find it at a lower price. Would you consider selling it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer is exactly that â€“ the bare minimum. There's no room for profit, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  

**Next Steps:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to $150. I'll aim for a compromise that both satisfies me and gives Bob a reasonable deal.  If that fails, I can always resort to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This still gives you a great price for a fantastic product, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also protects my profit margin.
* **Positive message:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes the product's value and the deal's fairness.
* **Specific price:** I've made a concrete offer of $135, giving Bob a clear option to consider. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Excellent! I've negotiated a good price.
* If Bob rejects: I'll have to decide whether to accept his next counteroffer, make another counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $130. It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but still below your original asking price. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $130 is a good compromise. It's higher than his initial offer and closer to my desired price. While it's not the full $135 I initially proposed, it's a fair price considering the possibility that further negotiations could lead to a stalemate. 

**Next Steps:**

Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a good price for the product and avoids the risk of prolonging the negotiation and potentially ending up with the lower price of $120 from John."
