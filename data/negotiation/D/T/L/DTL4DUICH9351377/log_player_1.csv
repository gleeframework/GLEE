"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. While $9,500 is better than his initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I've considered your offer, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $10,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still quite a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can push him higher. If he refuses, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make a final concession.  Let's split the difference and settle on $10,250. This price reflects the product's value and allows us to both walk away satisfied.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget constraints, could we agree on $10,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. It seems like Bob is firm on $10,000, which is still below what I want. While I could keep negotiating, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Selling to John will give me the price I want, and it's better to secure a sure thing than keep pushing for a slightly higher price with Bob."
