Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it would be a great addition to your operations. My asking price is $950,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree that it's a valuable product, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $700,000 is too low. I'm still hopeful that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below my minimum asking price.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects a considerable reduction from my initial price, demonstrating my willingness to work with you.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch. Would you be open to $750,000? That would allow me to move forward comfortably. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer of $750,000.  It's closer, but I'm holding out for a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I hope it's a number we can agree on.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm ready to make a move to finalize this.  Would you consider $780,000?  I think that's a fair offer that recognizes the value while working within my constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offers are still too low, and I'm running out of time. It's better to secure a sale now than risk further negotiations and potentially end up with nothing."
