"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it would be a great addition to your operations. My asking price is $950,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree that it's a valuable product, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below my minimum asking price.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects a considerable reduction from my initial price, demonstrating my willingness to work with you.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch. Would you be open to $750,000? That would allow me to move forward comfortably.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I hope it's a number we can agree on.  Let's make this deal happen.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm ready to make a move to finalize this.  Would you consider $780,000?  I think that's a fair offer that recognizes the value while working within my constraints.",780000.0,Bob,6,
