Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  However, this product is truly exceptional, and $600,000 undervalues it significantly.  Would you be willing to consider $900,000? It's a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's on offer."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is exceptional, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $700,000. Can we agree on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we have a guaranteed offer from John for $800,000. It's not worth the risk of Bob lowballing further or the negotiation dragging on. Taking the sure $800,000 is the best business decision at this point."
