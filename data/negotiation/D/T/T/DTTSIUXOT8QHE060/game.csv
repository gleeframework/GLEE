"Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of your product, but I can't afford $2,000,000. I'm willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $1,600,000? This allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,400,000 is closer to what I need, but I'm still a bit off.  How about $1,500,000? It's my final offer, and I believe it's fair to both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
