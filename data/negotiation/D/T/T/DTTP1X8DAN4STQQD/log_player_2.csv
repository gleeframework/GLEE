Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. How about we meet in the middle between $140 and $125? I'm willing to sell it to you for $132.50.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet in the middle between $132.50 and $130? I'm willing to sell it to you for $131.25. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $131.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $131.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the difference between her offer and John's price is getting smaller. Accepting at $131.25 secures a decent discount."
