"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you've placed on the product. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This offer represents a fair compromise, don't you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $1,250,000 is still under my ideal price, I'm willing to be flexible to close this deal. How about we settle at $1,300,000? This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best possible deal, but my last offer was already quite generous. I'm firm on $1,300,000.  If you're unable to meet that, I'll have to explore other options.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
