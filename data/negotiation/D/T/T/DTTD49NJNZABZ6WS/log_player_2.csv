This is a reasonable starting point. It shows I'm interested but also aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's asking price and my maximum budget.  We'll see how Alice responds and adjust accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $85, but I'm not willing to go lower than that. It's a great product and I think you'll really appreciate it.

You have three options:

Alice is coming down, but there's still room for negotiation. We'll try a counteroffer a bit closer to her price but still below our $80 limit."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $82, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great product and I think it's worth more than that, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $82 is a reasonable price, saving us $18 compared to John's offer. It's time to accept and secure the deal."
