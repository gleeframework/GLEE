"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. It's a good product, but I'm on a tight budget.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $12,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum price. Let's work together to make this happen.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",13000.0,Bob,4,
