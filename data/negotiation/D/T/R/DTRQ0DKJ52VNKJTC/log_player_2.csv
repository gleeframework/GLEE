"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a good deal compared to John's $1,000,000 offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to Alice's value of $800,000 as possible.  This counteroffer of $850,000 is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.  It's a reasonable starting point for the negotiation, and shows Bob's seriousness about buying the product while also being price-conscious."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better deal than John's offer, Bob can still potentially do better.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and attempt to push Alice further down in price. There's still a gap between Alice's offer and Bob's ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He knows Alice won't accept $850,000, but he wants to avoid going too high. Offering $875,000 is a compromise that shows he's serious about buying the product while still trying to get a good deal. This also gives Alice a bit more profit than her original valuation of $800,000."
