"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to go that low just yet. How about $11,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's keep this conversation going!",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,500. I think this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,
