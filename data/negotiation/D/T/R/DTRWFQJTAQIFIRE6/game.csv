"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the value of the product. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,400,000. I am willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline at $1,350,000. I am still working within a strict budget and cannot exceed $1,250,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer is more in line with what you're willing to consider.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway at $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. I am willing to offer $1,275,000 for the product. This amount is a compromise that respects both our positions and stays within my budget constraints. I look forward to your response.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
