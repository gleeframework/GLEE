Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 presents a compelling deal for Bob. It's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price but still a substantial profit over his perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is my initial offer, the message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he desires. This allows for some flexibility in the negotiation."
