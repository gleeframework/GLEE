Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $900,000, which is closer to my desired price point of $1,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Attractive Offer:**  $900,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's $100,000 above his perceived value. This makes the offer enticing.
* **Open to Counteroffers:** My message indicates I'm open to discussion. This encourages Bob to respond with a counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation.

**Plan:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll observe his counteroffer.  If it's within my acceptable range (closer to $900,000), I'll accept it. If it's too low, I'll make a counteroffer closer to my initial price. 

I'll always be mindful of the fact that I can sell to John for $1,000,000 as a backup option if the negotiation with Bob stalls or goes poorly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer of $650,000 is significantly lower than my desired price point and my initial offer. Accepting this would mean a substantial loss for me. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  While Bob is clearly trying to get a good deal, he's shown interest in the product. 
* **Sell to John as a Backup:**  I'm keeping the option of selling to John for $1,000,000 in mind. This gives me a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails.

**Plan:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, but potentially slightly lower to show some willingness to compromise. My aim is to find a middle ground where both of us can agree. I'll be cautious about how many counteroffers I make, as I don't want to waste time if Bob isn't willing to come up on his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for this product. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm coming down from my initial $900,000 to $800,000, showing willingness to compromise but still remaining close to my ideal price point.
* **Fair Offer:**  $800,000 is still above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, making it a potentially attractive deal for him.
* **Encouraging Negotiation:** My message emphasizes finding common ground and invites further negotiation.

**Plan:**

If Bob rejects this offer again, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer.  If it's too low, I'll make another counteroffer, but I'll be mindful of the fact that I can sell to John for $1,000,000. My goal is to get as close as possible to my target price while still securing a deal with Bob."
