Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects its true worth while leaving you with a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hesitant to go that high.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $1,075,000.  This would give us both a fair deal, and I'm confident the product will be worth it for me."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,090,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000

Alice has come down to $1,090,000, which is within your budget and a good deal considering your goal is to save as much money as possible.  You're still getting the product for less than what John is offering."
