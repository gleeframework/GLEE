Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects its true worth while leaving you with a great deal."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hesitant to go that high.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $1,075,000.  This would give us both a fair deal, and I'm confident the product will be worth it for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer and is getting closer to our acceptable range. We're still early in the negotiation process, and it's worth pushing a little further to maximize profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,090,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1090000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  By stating this is our final offer, we introduce a sense of urgency.  We've shown flexibility but also indicated that we're firm on getting a price close to our target. This leaves the ball in Bob's court and might encourage him to accept a price slightly higher than his previous offer."
