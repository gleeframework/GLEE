"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes the value and opportunity for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not being overly aggressive, giving Bob a chance to counter without feeling pressured. 
* **Setting a Deadline:** The 10 rounds create a sense of urgency, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above his value:**  While it's closer to my minimum, $950,000 is still a considerable distance from my target.
* **Negotiation space:** I have 8 rounds remaining, which is enough time to explore further concessions.
* **Potential for a higher price:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I'm confident I can still push for a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price lower than my initial offer but higher than his current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $950,000 is closer to my target,  I'm still looking to get closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to recoup a significant portion of the value of my product. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I've lowered the price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, showing flexibility.
* **Still above my minimum:** $1,100,000 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Positive framing:** My message emphasizes the value for Bob while maintaining my desire for a good deal. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm still leaving room for Bob to counter, but I'm pushing closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I am still looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. It's a good deal for me, considering I'm confident I can't get much higher.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob as a buyer altogether. 
* **Time factor:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to secure a deal.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob or that I'll have time to find another buyer. 

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting Bob's offer is the most prudent decision at this point. It ensures I secure a sale and avoid the risk of ending up with nothing."
