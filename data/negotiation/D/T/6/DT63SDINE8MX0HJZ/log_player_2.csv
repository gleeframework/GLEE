"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1800000. I believe it's a great value for you and I'm confident it will be a beneficial asset to your operations.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a more reasonable price and potentially negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in your product, $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it, considering the potential benefits I see. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's unfortunately too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000, which is a significant discount from my original price.  This still allows me to make a profit and allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a fair price. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  He's willing to pay $1,200,000 from John, so there's still room to negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting and counteroffering again allows Bob to try and get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,500,000 is still beyond what I can reasonably afford. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,250,000. This represents a significant investment on my part and hopefully is a reasonable compromise for you as well."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
