Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and then adjust my price accordingly, or I can choose to sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum valuation of $12,000. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell for a low price."
