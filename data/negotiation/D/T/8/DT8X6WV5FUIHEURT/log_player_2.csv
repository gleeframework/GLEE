"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $15,000, Bob can likely do better. There are still 9 rounds left, and he knows he can get the product from John for $12,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for the $12,000 price from John, but he needs to test the waters with Alice first. Offering $12,500 is a reasonable starting point, as it's halfway between Alice's offer and Bob's target price. It shows Bob is serious about negotiating but also leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is still higher than Bob's target price of $12,000.  He can still get the product from John for a lower price, and there are several rounds left to negotiate with Alice. Rejecting allows Bob to continue exploring a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of slowly approaching his target price. He's increased his offer by $250 from the previous round, showing Alice he's willing to negotiate but still holding firm on his desire to save money. He also has the security of knowing he can always go with John's offer, so he can afford to be a little more patient."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still higher than Bob's target price. While there are still more rounds to negotiate, Alice has shown she is not willing to budge much.  At this point, Bob has been steadily lowering the price, and Alice has been moving up, suggesting there may not be much common ground. With only 5 rounds remaining, it's becoming riskier to continue negotiating with Alice.  Buying from John for $12,000 ensures Bob gets the product at his target price and avoids the potential for further negotiation deadlock."
