{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can reach a fair price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly lower than your minimum but still allows for room to negotiate.  It also highlights the value of the product to you while framing it as a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! $9,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price that considers its value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  There's still room to negotiate with Bob, so rejecting his offer allows you to explore a counter-offer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about $8,200?  That's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $8,200 is still below your ideal price of $10,000, it is very close. Continuing to negotiate risks the possibility that Bob will walk away entirely or you will end up selling to John for $10,000.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale that is within a reasonable range of your desired profit."
