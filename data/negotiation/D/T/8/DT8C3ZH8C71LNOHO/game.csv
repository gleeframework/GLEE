"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $100. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $80. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $80, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $95. This is as low as I'm willing to go. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to stick with my original offer of $80. It's the best I can do, but I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",80.0,Bob,6,
