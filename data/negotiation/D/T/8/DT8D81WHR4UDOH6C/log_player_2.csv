"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I'm looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer. He has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's room for negotiation. Bob has 10 rounds and should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Given the value to me and your potential profit margin, I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. Bob has a good understanding of Alice's minimum acceptable price and the product's value to him. The offer is $50,000 lower than Alice's initial offer, which is a significant step but still leaves room for further negotiation. The message aims to create a positive tone and emphasize the potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is very close to Bob's counteroffer of $850,000.  Bob has a limited number of rounds and should aim to close the deal before he reaches the point where he might need to buy from John.  Given the value of the product to Bob and the time constraint, accepting the offer is the best decision."
