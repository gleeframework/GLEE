Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than your guaranteed sale price ($15,000) allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value to encourage Bob to consider a higher price than he might have initially intended.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could also start with a lower price closer to Bob's perceived value to increase the chances of an immediate sale, even if it means potentially earning less than you could have."
