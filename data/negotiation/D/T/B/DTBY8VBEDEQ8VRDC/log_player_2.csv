"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's currently worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a price below its true value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'm interested in the product, but I'm not sure if the price is right. Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, I'm not sure if she's willing to go lower. I'll reject her offer for now and see if I can get a better deal.
