"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $11,500.** This is lower than the price you'd pay from John ($12,000).
* **Your goal is to save money.** Accepting Alice's offer saves you $500 compared to buying from John. 

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer."
