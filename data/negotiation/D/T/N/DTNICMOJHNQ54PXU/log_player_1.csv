"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $10,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially secure a good price.  I'll see if Bob bites or makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm eager to sell, I won't undervalue my product. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $16,000. This shows flexibility and hopefully encourages Bob to come up a bit in his offer. It's still well above what he's willing to pay, but I'm aiming for a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what I'm willing to accept. While I don't want to risk losing the sale to John,  I'll make another counteroffer to see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $14,000. This is getting closer to what Bob is willing to pay, and I'm hoping to find a middle ground this round.  It's a good price for both of us, and I'm hoping Bob will finally agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a slightly better price by continuing the negotiation. I'll make one more counteroffer to see if we can finalize the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway this round, offering $13,500. This shows I'm serious about closing the deal, and it's still above my minimum price. Hopefully, Bob will finally accept."
