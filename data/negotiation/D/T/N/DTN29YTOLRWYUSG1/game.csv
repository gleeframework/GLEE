"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product.  While it's interesting, $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, Bob. However, I'm willing to be flexible and make one more concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is close, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,200. Would that work for you?",9200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your target, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me halfway. I'll offer it to you for $9,400. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9400.0,Alice,7,
