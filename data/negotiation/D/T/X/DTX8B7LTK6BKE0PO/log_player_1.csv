"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think would be a great asset for you.  My asking price is $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Room for compromise:** $18,000 is still significantly lower than the product's worth to me ($15,000).
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes potential benefits for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. While I understand the value of the product, my budget is limited. Would you consider reducing the price to $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $14,000 is lower than my absolute minimum of $15,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** I still have 8 rounds to negotiate. It's worth seeing if I can get a higher offer from Bob. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  John's offer of $15,000 is a guaranteed safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I can't go that low.  Given the product's value,  $16,000 would be my lowest price point.  Let's keep the conversation going - what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards a compromise:**  I'm reducing my price from the initial $18,000, showing flexibility.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $16,000 is still above my minimum price of $15,000, ensuring I don't sell at a loss.
* **Keeping the negotiation open:** The message maintains a positive tone and encourages further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget, I propose a price of $15,000. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  $15,000 is my absolute minimum acceptable price, and it aligns with what I'd get from John.
* **No further gain:**  Negotiating further with Bob might lead to a higher price, but it's a risk. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal, and I could potentially lose out on both Bob and John. 
* **Time is a factor:**  Each round spent negotiating with Bob reduces the number of rounds I have to potentially reach a higher offer.  Accepting now guarantees a sale and a fair price."
