"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you letting me know about this product. However, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $150 for it. Let me know what you think.",150.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $150 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $165. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",165.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. While $165 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping for a better deal.  I'm happy to pay $155. It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my limits.",155.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $160. This is as low as I can go, Bob. I really think this product is worth more than that, but I'm willing to compromise.",160.0,Alice,5,
