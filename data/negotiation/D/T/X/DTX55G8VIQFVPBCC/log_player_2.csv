"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $15,000, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is trying to anchor you to the idea that the product is worth $15,000 to you, but you know your own valuation. 
* You have a backup option with John at $15,000, so there's no risk of losing out entirely if you reject Alice's offer.
* By rejecting, you signal that you're not willing to pay that price, and Alice might come back with a lower counteroffer."
