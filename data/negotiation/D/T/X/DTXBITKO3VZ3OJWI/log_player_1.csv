I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it still leaves me with a decent profit.  I'm hoping to entice Bob with a good deal while still maintaining a profitable transaction for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  It's still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly less than my minimum price, but it also allows me to make a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is still too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, it's getting close to my minimum price.  To avoid further haggling and ensure a profitable sale, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
