Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it for $12,000 (Bob's maximum value), there's no guarantee he'd accept. I want to maximize my profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Above My Minimum:** This price is significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($10,000), ensuring a good profit.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best possible price from Bob and securing a sale without having to resort to John's lower offer."
