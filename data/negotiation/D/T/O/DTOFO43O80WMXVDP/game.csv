"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it will be equally valuable for you. I'm asking for $1,200,000 for it. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows me to acquire it within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly exceptional and worth more. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while still being within a reasonable range for you. Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value this product highly, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to securing this product. I believe this price represents a fair compromise for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your increased offer. However, $950,000 is still not enough to cover my expenses. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and ensures a smooth transaction for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
