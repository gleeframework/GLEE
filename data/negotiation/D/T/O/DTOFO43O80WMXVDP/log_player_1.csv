Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows me to acquire it within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly exceptional and worth more.

Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value this product highly, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to securing this product. I believe this price represents a fair compromise for both of us.
