"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it will be equally valuable for you. I'm asking for $1,200,000 for it. What do you think?

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. I'll reject her initial offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value this product highly, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still outside my comfort zone.

I believe this price represents a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your increased offer. However, $950,000 is still not enough to cover my expenses.
