Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but I'm leaving room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and allows for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, but I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, but it's still a good price for me. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if he rejects, I'm ready to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my initial target. While I could keep negotiating, the potential gains are small and the risk of losing the deal entirely is higher. It's time to accept the offer and secure the sale."
