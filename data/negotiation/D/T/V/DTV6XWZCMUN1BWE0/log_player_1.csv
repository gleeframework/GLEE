"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($15,000) but significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This creates room for negotiation and allows me to assess Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counter with a price closer to my original offer.  There are still 8 rounds remaining, and I don't want to settle for a price that's too low too early."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still maintaining a significant margin over Bob's initial offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, I still believe I can secure a higher price.  We are approaching the middle ground, and it's important to not settle too quickly. There are still 6 rounds remaining, and I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm further lowering my price to $11,500, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This demonstrates flexibility and shows that I'm willing to meet him halfway.  With only 5 rounds left, I need to start closing the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. While tempting to sell now, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I believe that Bob might be willing to go higher, especially since we're nearing the end of the negotiation.  With 4 rounds remaining, I still have room to make counteroffers and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final push with a counteroffer of $11,000. This is a compromise, offering a slight increase from Bob's last offer but still above my minimum acceptable value. With only 3 rounds left, I need to find a way to close the deal, but I don't want to settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value, and I'm not confident that he will increase his offer further. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my desired profit and avoids the risk of getting stuck with a lower price. It's a more secure option compared to continuing the negotiation with Bob."
