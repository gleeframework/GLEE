"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm willing to let it go for $10000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget ($15,000).  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and negotiate a lower price. There's a good chance I can get the product for less than $15,000 from Alice, saving me money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be happy to pay $7,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's original price but still within a reasonable range. I'm hoping to get a better price than $15,000 from John, but I'm also willing to pay a little more if the product is truly worth it.  A counteroffer of $7,500 leaves room for negotiation while still demonstrating my genuine interest."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $7500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $8500.  This is a great price for a truly fantastic product, and I think it's fair to both of us. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my ideal price point.  I'm confident that I can negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $7,500.  There's no reason to rush into a decision, as I can still purchase from John if I can't secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $8,500 is still a little high for me, but I'm willing to go to $8,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of this fantastic product. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm incrementally raising my offer, showing I'm serious about buying the product while still pushing for a lower price.  Offering $8,000 demonstrates a willingness to compromise while keeping the final price within my budget and potentially saving more than buying from John."
