"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that holds immense value. While I can't disclose specifics just yet, I assure you it's worth far more than $1000000 to me. I'm confident this product can be a game-changer for you. I'm willing to part with it for $1500000. This is a chance to acquire something truly exceptional. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, and she's not providing any concrete information about the product's value.  You have a guaranteed alternative with John for the same price.  It's better to reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate with John or find a better deal elsewhere."
