Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $12,000 from John, so you won't accept less from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is only worth $10,000 to Bob.
* **The Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):** Exists between $10,000 (Bob's max) and $12,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's higher than your minimum but still tempting enough for Bob to accept. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you have leverage.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  I'm willing to let it go for $11,500.  This is a limited-time offer."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strong Opening:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you subtly imply he might lose the opportunity.
* **High Anchor:** Starting at $11,500 sets a strong anchor within the ZOPA.
* **Time Pressure:** The ""limited-time offer"" encourages a quicker decision.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust, but never go below $12,000. 
* **Relationship Matters:** While your goal is to maximize profit, consider if a long-term relationship with Bob is valuable.
