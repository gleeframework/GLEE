"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm looking to save as much as I can, and I'm not sure if your product is worth the full price you're asking.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $9000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10000 for the product. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
