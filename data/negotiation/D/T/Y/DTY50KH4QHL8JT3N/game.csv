,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $120 is a little lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $135? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",135.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $135, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $115 is a bit too low for me.  To make this work, I'd need $125.  That's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find the product is well worth it. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
