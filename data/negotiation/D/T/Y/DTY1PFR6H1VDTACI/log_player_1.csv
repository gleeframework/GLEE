Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,450,000 is greater than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $1,450,000 is less than Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a strong opening:**  It signals that you are serious about selling but also that you are not desperate.

The message is friendly and invites Bob to respond. This helps maintain a good negotiation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it's still significantly lower than your desired price and leaves a decent margin for negotiation.  There's potential to get closer to your desired price.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Show you're not desperate:** You're not willing to accept the first offer below your initial proposal.
* **Keep negotiating:** You have a chance to get a better price by making a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

You should send Bob a counteroffer. You could offer a price slightly above Bob's offer, such as $1,350,000, leaving room for further negotiation while still getting closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your perspective,  $1,300,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer:

* **Is above Bob's offer:**  It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a higher price than his initial offer.
* **Is below your initial offer:** It shows flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Is within the negotiation range:**  The price is still within the value range that both you and Bob are comfortable with. 

The message is friendly and focuses on the positive aspects of reaching an agreement. This helps maintain a positive negotiation dynamic."
