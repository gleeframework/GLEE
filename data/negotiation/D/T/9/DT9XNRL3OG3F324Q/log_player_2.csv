"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $1,400,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000. Therefore, accepting the offer is not a good option. Buying from John for $1,500,000 is also not ideal, as there's potential to negotiate a better price with Alice.  

Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to secure a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your position.  However, $1,300,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. To be fair to both of us, I propose we meet in the middle at $1,375,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's intrinsic value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,375,000**.  This is within Bob's budget of $1,500,000.
* **Bob wants to save as much money as possible**.  While he could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer, forcing him to buy from John for a higher price.
* **Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a purchase within Bob's budget and secures the product**. This is a good compromise, especially considering the potential risks of further negotiation."
