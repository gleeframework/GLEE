Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit on a tight budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
