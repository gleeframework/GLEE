"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit on a tight budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can we discuss further?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10250.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $10250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm making a new counteroffer of $9750. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price that works for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
