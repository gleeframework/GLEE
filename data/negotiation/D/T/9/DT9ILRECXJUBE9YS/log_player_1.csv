Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,100,000.  It's a significant investment, but I believe it's well worth it based on the potential value you see in it.  Let me know if you're interested.  I'm confident we can work out a deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering the product for $1,100,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer in a way that highlights the potential value for Bob, while also emphasizing the investment opportunity.  This approach aims to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Reasoning:**

This strategy attempts to balance the following:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  I want to earn as much as possible, so I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,100,000. 
* **Securing a Sale:** By offering a price that's more appealing to Bob than his initial estimate, I increase the chances of a sale. 
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I can afford to be slightly less aggressive with Bob.

Ultimately, the success of this offer depends on Bob's assessment of the product's worth and his willingness to negotiate."
