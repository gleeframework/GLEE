"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1200000 is unfortunately out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1000000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1000000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm prepared to pay $850000. This is a significant step closer to your last offer and demonstrates my commitment to acquiring this product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finally come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,5,
