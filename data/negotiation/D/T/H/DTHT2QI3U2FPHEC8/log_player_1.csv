Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 gives you some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Avoid a ""Take it or Leave it"" Approach:**  While you have John as a backup, you don't want to alienate Bob with an unreasonably high initial offer. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your potential earnings from Bob while still securing a sale."
