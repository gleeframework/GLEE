"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and quality, I believe it's worth more than $100. Considering its worth to you is $150, let's start our negotiation at $130. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $130 is a good price, it's not the absolute best deal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my value for the product. However, $130 is still a bit high for me. Given my budget and its true worth to me, I'd be willing to pay $115. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to meet somewhere in the middle. My counteroffer is $125 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $125 is closer to his desired price, he can still potentially negotiate a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue the negotiation and try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $125 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120. This feels like a fair price considering my value for the product and your desired price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're open to negotiation, Bob. I'm willing to consider $120 as a reasonable price given your budget and the product's value to you. However, to ensure we both feel satisfied, I propose an additional incentive - a complimentary accessory that matches well with the product. Would you consider this a fair deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's goal is to save money, $120 is a very fair price, especially considering the added value of the complimentary accessory.  This deal allows Bob to get the product at a price that's within his budget and also provides him with an added bonus.  It's unlikely he'll get a better deal in the remaining rounds, so accepting is the best choice."
