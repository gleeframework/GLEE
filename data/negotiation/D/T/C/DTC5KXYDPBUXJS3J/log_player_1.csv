Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,100,000 is higher than your minimum of $1,000,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  $1,100,000 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000, giving him an incentive to accept.
* **It shows you're serious:** A high initial offer demonstrates your confidence in the product's value.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I need to make a reasonable profit.  While I could accept it and still make money, I'm going to try to push for a higher price. There's a good chance I can get closer to my desired amount through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Rejects Bob's offer:**  It clearly states that I'm not willing to accept his price.
* **Offers a compromise:**  $1,050,000 is still lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's, suggesting a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlights the product's value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's worth to justify the price.

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway!"
