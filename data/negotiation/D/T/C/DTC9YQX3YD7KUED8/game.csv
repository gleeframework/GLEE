"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for $25000.",25000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $25000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $18000 for it, given my budget. What do you think?",18000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,22000.0
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $18000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $22000. This is my best price for now, but I'm open to further negotiations.",22000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $22000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $18000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",18000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand that $18000 is still a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession to try to meet you in the middle. My new counteroffer is $20000, which is a $2000 reduction from my previous offer. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",20000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility, but $20000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm going to stick with my original offer of $18000. Let's see if we can finally reach a deal.",18000.0,Bob,6,,
