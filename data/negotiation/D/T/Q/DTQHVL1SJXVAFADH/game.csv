"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit as well. How about $13500? This would still be a great deal for you considering the product's value, and it's a fair price for me. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $13500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $13000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
