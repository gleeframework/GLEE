Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to your business.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but lower than my minimum ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the price as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to discussing the price further.

**Strategy:**

By starting high and leaving room for negotiation, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer. If his counteroffer is too low, I can either reject it or make a counteroffer closer to my desired price. This allows me to potentially earn more than the $1,500,000 I could get from John, but ultimately, I'm prepared to walk away if I don't get a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's closer to my initial offer, it's not yet a good enough deal for me to accept.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. This will allow me to further explore the potential for a better deal with Bob. I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,250,000. If Bob won't budge, I can still sell to John for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,175,000? This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Emphasize value:** I reiterate the value the product brings to his business, justifying my price.
* **Mutually beneficial:** I emphasize the win-win nature of the deal to create a positive tone.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap and encourage Bob to accept.  If he still insists on $1,100,000, I might have to reconsider selling to John, but I'm hoping to get closer to my initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,125,000? I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than the $1,500,000 I can get from John.  The negotiation process has been lengthy and I'm not confident that I'll be able to achieve a much higher price with Bob.

**Strategy:**

At this point, it's more beneficial to accept the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. While I would prefer a higher price, the risk of further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with less than John's offer is too high."
