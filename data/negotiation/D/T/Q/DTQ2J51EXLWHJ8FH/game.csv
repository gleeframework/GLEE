"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is a significant drop from my initial price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I respect your valuation of the product, I am still looking to keep my expenses within my limit. Could we agree on $1,075,000? It's a slight increase from my previous offer, closer to your initial proposal, but still within my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
