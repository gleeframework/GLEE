"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will bring you a significant return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the value of the product, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To be frank, I've already got a very competitive offer on the table, but I believe in finding the right partnership for this product. Let's settle this right now.  Would you consider $1,725,000?",1725000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,725,000 is the right price. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, $1,600,000, and that's as high as I'm willing to go.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
