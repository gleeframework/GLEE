"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its immense value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
 ""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to maximize potential profit.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves space for negotiation and potential counteroffers from Bob.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message uses positive language and conveys confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your valuation of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly above our minimum acceptable price ($800,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still a considerable gap between his offer and both our initial asking price and his perceived value. We have room to negotiate a better deal. 
* **Early in the Process:** It's only Round 2. We have plenty of time to counter-offer and try to reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $950,000 falls short of what I consider a fair deal. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This price reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
 ""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've made a significant concession from our initial price, signaling flexibility but maintaining a strong stance. 
* **Justifying the Price:**  We're reiterating the product's value to reinforce our position and justify the higher price.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counter-offer aims to find a middle ground while still staying closer to our desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still looking to keep my expenses within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000. I hope this is a more suitable proposal for us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 represents a $200,000 profit over our minimum acceptable price and is a significant gain.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Both sides have made concessions, and this offer reflects a fair compromise. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While we might be able to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's always a risk Bob could walk away. Accepting now secures a very good deal."
