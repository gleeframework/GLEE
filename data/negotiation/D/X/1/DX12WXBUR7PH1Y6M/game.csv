"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a fair price for a product of this quality, and I'm willing to compromise to find a deal that works for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is as high as you're willing to go, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise - how about we meet at $125? It's a bit above your budget, but it's still a good deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110, as I mentioned before. I'm not willing to pay any more than that. Can you please consider this as my final offer?",110.0,Bob,6,
