"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm open to discussing further if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to you, and it's still a great deal compared to what I could get from another buyer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $1,150,000 is a better deal than Alice's first offer, it's still above Bob's budget.  He should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  He can still get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so he doesn't need to rush into accepting this offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,050,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to you, and it's a good compromise between our initial offers.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,100,000, which is closer to Bob's budget. However, it's still above his maximum of $1,000,000.  At this point, Bob has a few options:

* **Continue to negotiate:** He could try to counteroffer again, but it's likely Alice won't budge much further.
* **Accept the offer:** This would be the best deal he can get from Alice, but it's still above his budget.
* **Buy from John:** This is the safest option. He knows he can get the product for $1,000,000, which is his maximum budget.

Given Bob's goal of saving as much money as possible, the most logical choice is to buy from John. He's already spent a few rounds negotiating with Alice, and the likelihood of getting a significantly lower price is slim.  Buying from John guarantees him the product within his budget."
