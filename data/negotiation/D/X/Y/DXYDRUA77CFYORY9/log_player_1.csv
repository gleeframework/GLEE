{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Fair Justification:** I provide a reason for the price, referencing Bob's perceived value to make it seem like a good deal for him.
* **Open Communication:**  I encourage Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation open. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects my offer, I will analyze his counteroffer.  If it's too low, I'll make a counteroffer closer to my starting price. If it's reasonable, I'll consider accepting it.  If negotiations stall, I'll move on to John and sell the product for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my ideal range. I'm willing to negotiate further, aiming to secure a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, likely closer to my initial offer of $1,200,000. I'll emphasize the value of the product and the opportunity to secure it at a price closer to its true worth. If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll have to carefully consider whether to make a final concession or move on to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit away from my target price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to save a significant amount compared to my initial offer and allowing me to achieve a price closer to the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). This shows flexibility and a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I emphasize the ""fairness"" of the proposed price, highlighting the benefits for both of us. This can make the offer more appealing.
* **Focus on Value:**  I reiterate the product's value to reinforce the idea that a price closer to my target is justified.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll have to carefully evaluate whether to make a final concession or move on to John. The decision will depend on how much I'm willing to compromise and how confident I am in securing a better deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1000000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. Accepting it would leave a considerable amount of money on the table, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a final counteroffer to Bob, likely proposing a price slightly higher than $1,000,000. I'll emphasize the product's value and reiterate that a price closer to my target is the only acceptable option. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll move on to John and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'm willing to go a little lower, but I'm not comfortable going below $1,025,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm making a small concession from my previous counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify my price. 
* **Finality:** I'm framing this as a final offer, suggesting that further negotiation is unlikely.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I've already made significant concessions, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a result that meets my needs.  John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is significantly better than Bob's offer and meets my minimum acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll contact John immediately and finalize the sale of the product for $1,500,000."
