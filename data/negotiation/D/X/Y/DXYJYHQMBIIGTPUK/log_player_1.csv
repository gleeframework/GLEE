Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit higher than your offer.  How about we split the difference and go with $16,000? This seems like a fair compromise considering the quality of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering the quality of the product, I would like to propose a price of $15750. This is my final offer within my budget range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $15,750 is getting close to my desired value, and I'm concerned that if I reject, he might walk away completely.  It's better to secure a deal at this point, and I can always try to sell for more to another buyer in the future."
