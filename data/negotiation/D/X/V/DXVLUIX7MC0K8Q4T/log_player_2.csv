"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it! However, I'm looking to get a fair price for it, considering its value to you is $10,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to make a profit. Let's say I'll sell it to you for $12,000. It's a great price, and I think you'll agree it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
