"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $5,000 is too low for me.  Could you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial price, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500? That's the most I can offer at this time.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some middle ground.  How about we split the difference and settle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're getting closer!  I appreciate the compromise, but $8,500 is still a stretch for me. I could meet you halfway between our last offers at $7,500. That's the absolute best I can do.",7500.0,Bob,6,
