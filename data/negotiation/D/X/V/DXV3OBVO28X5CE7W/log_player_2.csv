"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $14,000. I think it will be very valuable for you, and this is a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your budget and what John is offering. It's highly unlikely you'll get a deal close to your budget if you accept this. You should counteroffer with a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often involves starting with a lower offer than your ideal price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Alice to counter.
* **Signaling Interest:** While the offer is low, it shows you're serious about buying the product and willing to negotiate.
* **Gauging Alice's Position:**  This initial counteroffer will give you an idea of how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $5,000 is too low for me.  Could you consider $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  While Alice moved considerably from her initial offer, $10,000 is still above your budget and what John is offering. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to negotiate suggests there's potential to reach a price closer to your target."

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial price, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500? That's the most I can offer at this time."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:** This counteroffer shows Alice you're willing to negotiate by significantly increasing your previous offer.
* **Staying Below John's Price:**  The offer is still a good amount below John's $8,000, allowing room for further negotiation while ensuring you don't overpay if Alice accepts.
* **Setting a Limit:**  By stating ""$6,500 is the most I can offer,"" you're setting a clear boundary for Alice, which may encourage her to make a final decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some middle ground.  How about we split the difference and settle at $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Above John's Price:** Alice's offer is now only slightly above what John is offering.  
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  While the difference is small, it's worth seeing if Alice will come down a little more, especially since you've already negotiated her down significantly. You're in a strong position to push for a price closer to John's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, you're getting closer!  I appreciate the compromise, but $8,500 is still a stretch for me. I could meet you halfway between our last offers at $7,500. That's the absolute best I can do."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  By saying ""absolute best I can do,"" you're signaling to Alice that this is your final offer, encouraging her to make a decision.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Offering a compromise that's exactly halfway between your last two offers shows you're willing to negotiate fairly but standing your ground on the price.
* **Below John's Price:** This offer keeps you below your fallback option of buying from John, maximizing your potential savings."
