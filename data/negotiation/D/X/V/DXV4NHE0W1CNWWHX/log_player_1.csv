Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle while still exceeding your minimum price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a safety net. You can afford to be a bit bolder in your initial offer to Bob. 

This strategy aims to secure a price significantly higher than your minimum while acknowledging Bob's valuation and potential desire to negotiate."
