"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a lower price, and I can still make a good profit. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget, and I need to make sure it fits within it.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and see that you're really interested in the product.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but it's a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would be a good compromise and allow us to both get what we want.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $920,000 is a fair offer, and I'm willing to come down just a little further.  How about we settle on $930,000?  This gives you a great price on the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  It's a win-win for both of us.",930000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $930,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $915,000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",915000.0,Bob,6,
