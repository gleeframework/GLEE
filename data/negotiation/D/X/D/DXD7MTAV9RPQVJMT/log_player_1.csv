Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum.  This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest while still protecting my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum. While I'd like to get a sale, selling at $100 would leave me with a loss. I'll counter-offer and try to reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $120. I'd be willing to meet you at $110, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm confident John will buy it at my minimum price, so I'll choose to sell to him instead of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
