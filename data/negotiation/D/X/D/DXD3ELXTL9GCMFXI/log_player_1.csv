"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to capture a large portion of the surplus value.  I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I want to see how Bob responds before making any further concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but still want to maximize my profit. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob without sacrificing too much of my own value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. This is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and is closer to my desired price than what John is offering. Although there are still a few rounds left, I'd rather secure the deal now than risk losing Bob and having to settle for John's offer."
