"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you've shown interest in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While Alice's offer of $100 is lower than her product's worth to her, you can get a better deal from John for $80."
