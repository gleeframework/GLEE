,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $90 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $75 right now. Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $82.50. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $82.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $80?  That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet in the middle. How about we go with $81? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done.",81.0,Alice,5,
