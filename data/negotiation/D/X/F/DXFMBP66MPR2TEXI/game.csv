"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the conversation at $12,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $9,500? That would be a great price for me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,500. I can do $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's actually the price John is willing to pay for the product if we don't come to an agreement. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
