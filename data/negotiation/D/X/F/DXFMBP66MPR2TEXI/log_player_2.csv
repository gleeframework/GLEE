"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the conversation at $12,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?

Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,500. I can do $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's actually the price John is willing to pay for the product if we don't come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

Alice is signaling that she won't go any lower, and John is offering the same price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or switching to John."
