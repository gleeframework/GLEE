"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you partway. How about we settle on $1,250,000? I believe this price point reflects the true worth of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
