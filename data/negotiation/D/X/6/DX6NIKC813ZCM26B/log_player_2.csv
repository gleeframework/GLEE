"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's in great condition and worth a lot more than that. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $130 is cheaper than John's $150, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $130 is a bit more than I'm hoping to spend right now.  Would you consider $110?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to take it off your hands."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $120 is my final price.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Bob values the product at $150, and Alice's offer of $120 is within his budget.
* **Saving:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, the potential saving is only $10. 
* **Risk:** There's a risk that Alice might reject another counteroffer, forcing Bob to buy from John for a higher price.

Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without unnecessary risk."
