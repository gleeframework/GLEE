Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm willing to offer it at the special price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, our goal is to get the highest price possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:** We start by offering the product at a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Attractive Offer:** By offering the product at $1,150,000, we present Bob with a potential gain (if he values it higher after further consideration) while still securing a significant profit above John's offer.

This strategy aims to find a balance between getting the absolute highest price and not scaring Bob away with an initial offer that's too close to $1,200,000."
