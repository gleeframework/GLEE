{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'll gauge Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a lower price in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm offering $13,500.  This is a compromise, acknowledging that Bob may not be willing to pay my original price. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob, but still allows me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a little more,  $13,000 is a good price, especially considering John is only offering $12,000. It's a good compromise that allows me to sell the product at a decent price."
