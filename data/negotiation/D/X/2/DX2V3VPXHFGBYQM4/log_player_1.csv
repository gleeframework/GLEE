Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,150,000 is above your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there is potential for a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **It's a strong opening offer:** By starting high, you signal that you believe in the value of your product and set a strong baseline for negotiation.

However, keep in mind:

* **Be prepared for counteroffers:** Bob may counteroffer with a lower price, so be prepared to negotiate. 
* **Consider John's offer:**  If Bob's counteroffer is too low, you always have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than your desired price and your initial offer.  Rejecting his offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price. You can counteroffer with a price closer to your initial offer, which would likely lead to a more favorable outcome than selling to John."
