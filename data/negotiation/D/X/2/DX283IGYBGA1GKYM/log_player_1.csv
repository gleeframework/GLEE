"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Attractive but Realistic:**  $1,200,000 is still within a range that Bob might consider, as the product is worth $800,000 to him. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message emphasizes the value of the product but also leaves the door open for discussion. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:**  The existence of John's $1,000,000 offer is a crucial factor.  It's my fallback option, so I can be more aggressive with Bob knowing I have a safety net.
* **Bob's Response:**  Bob's counteroffer will determine my next move. If his counteroffer is too low, I'll consider John's offer.
* **The Value of Time:** Each round represents a negotiation step, so I need to balance pushing for a higher price with the risk of running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **John's Offer:**  My safety net with John's $1,000,000 offer allows me to be more ambitious.
* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I can potentially achieve. 
* **Negotiation is Key:**  I'm confident I can secure a better price with further negotiation, particularly knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above $900,000, aiming to find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. It's a fair price that considers both our positions. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** My counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a compromise between my initial $1,200,000 and Bob's $900,000.
* **Value Proposition:** I reiterate the value of the product while acknowledging Bob's perspective.
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""Let's close this deal"" adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept.

**Key Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:**  My minimum remains $1,000,000, so I can still walk away if Bob doesn't meet my price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I'm reducing my offer incrementally to signal willingness to negotiate, but also showing that I'm not willing to give away too much.
* **Time Constraint:**  Each round brings me closer to the potential sale to John, so I need to be efficient in my negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $900,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. Can we agree on that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **John's Offer:**  My minimum remains $1,000,000, and John is willing to pay that.  
* **Bob's Counteroffer:** $950,000 is still below my minimum and not a significant enough increase from his previous offer.  
* **Time Constraint:**  I'm approaching the middle of the negotiation process and need to be strategic. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum but above his current offer.  This will continue to signal my willingness to negotiate while also emphasizing my minimum price point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position, but I'm still firm on the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,025,000. This is a fair price that reflects the unique benefits this product offers, and it's within a reasonable range for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price slightly closer to Bob's offer, showing my flexibility and eagerness to reach a deal. 
* **Value Justification:**  I again emphasize the product's value and highlight that my price is still reasonable.
* **Time Factor:** We're halfway through the negotiations, and I need to push for a deal that's closer to my minimum while also being mindful of the time limit.
* **John's Offer:**  I am still comfortable walking away and selling to John for $1,000,000. 

**Key Considerations:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  His response will determine my next move. If he is still unwilling to budge, I will likely move closer to my minimum or consider John's offer. 
* **The Importance of Communication:**  I'm using a friendly tone in my message to keep the negotiations positive and prevent a breakdown in communication."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I still think $900,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to offer $975,000, which is a compromise between our previous discussions. Can we agree on that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **John's Offer:** I'm still within the range where selling to John for $1,000,000 is a viable option.
* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  While $975,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider fair given the value of the product and the fact that Bob values it at $800,000.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  I still have several rounds left and can continue to push for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his current offer, aiming to close the gap while remaining within my minimum price range.  I'll need to balance pushing for a better price with the risk of running out of time."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but $975,000 still doesn't quite reflect the value we've discussed.  I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000.  This is my absolute minimum, but it's a price that acknowledges both our positions and allows us to close this deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **John's Offer:** I'm now at my minimum price, and John is offering the same amount, making this a crucial point in the negotiation.
* **Firm but Fair:** I'm stating my absolute minimum, showing that I'm serious about this price. However, I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the offer, considering both our positions.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm using language that encourages a quick agreement to avoid running out of time.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Bob's Response:**  His decision will be critical. If he rejects this offer, I'll likely accept John's offer to avoid losing the potential sale.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  This offer is a bold move, and it's a high-stakes situation. I'm confident in the value of the product, but I need to balance my desire for a better price with the risk of losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to meet me at $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit shy of that. I'm willing to meet you at $985,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **John's Offer:**  John is offering my minimum price of $1,000,000, which is the same as my counteroffer in the previous round.
* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob is offering $985,000, which is still below my minimum.
* **Time Constraint:** We are nearing the end of the negotiation process, and there is a high risk of not reaching an agreement.  

**Decision:**

While I would prefer to get a bit closer to my initial goal, with only a few rounds left, the risk of losing the deal entirely is too high. Accepting John's offer ensures a sale at my minimum price, and it's the most logical decision given the circumstances."
