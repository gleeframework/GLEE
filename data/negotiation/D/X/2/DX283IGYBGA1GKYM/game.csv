,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. It's a fair price that considers both our positions. Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $900,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. Can we agree on that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but I'm still firm on the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,025,000. This is a fair price that reflects the unique benefits this product offers, and it's within a reasonable range for both of us.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I still think $900,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to offer $975,000, which is a compromise between our previous discussions. Can we agree on that?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but $975,000 still doesn't quite reflect the value we've discussed.  I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000.  This is my absolute minimum, but it's a price that acknowledges both our positions and allows us to close this deal.  Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet me at $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit shy of that. I'm willing to meet you at $985,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",985000.0,Bob,8,
