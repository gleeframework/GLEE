Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $150. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price, even a vague one, can make the offer seem more reasonable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $150,  I signal that I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum.
 
**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** How Bob responds to this initial offer will be crucial in determining my next move. I'll need to analyze his counteroffer to decide if I should accept, counter, or move on to John.
* **Time Sensitivity:** While not explicitly stated, prolonged negotiations can be a risk.  I need to balance getting the best price with the possibility of John buying the product while I'm still negotiating with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($100) and his own valuation of the product. Accepting would mean a loss for me. While I want to maximize profit, I'm willing to negotiate.  I'll counter-offer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap and find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $80 is quite low considering the value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm signaling willingness to negotiate by significantly lowering my initial ask while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic can feel fair to both parties, potentially making Bob more receptive.
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm reiterating that the product has inherent value, justifying a price higher than his initial offer.

I'm strategically moving towards a price that's profitable for me while trying to find common ground with Bob.  I'm keeping in mind that I have the option of selling to John for a guaranteed $100 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing more willingness to negotiate by increasing his offer to $90, this is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries these risks:

* **Further Price Reductions:**  Bob might be very insistent on staying near his current offer, making it difficult to reach my desired price point.
* **Losing John's Offer:** Prolonged negotiations risk me missing out on the guaranteed $100 from John. 

Therefore, the most rational decision at this point is to secure the guaranteed profit by selling to John."
