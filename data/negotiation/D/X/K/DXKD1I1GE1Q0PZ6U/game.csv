"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125?",125.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $150.  That's still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130?,130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $130 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? That would be a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $140 is the best price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $135?,135.0,Bob,6,
