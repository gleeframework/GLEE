"Hi Alice,  $16,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but $10,000 is quite a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
