"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1750000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1400000 is significantly lower than what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1600000,  This price is still very fair, considering the value you'll gain from this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1600000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, which is a fair price given my budget and the product's value. Let's finalize this deal so we can both move forward.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
