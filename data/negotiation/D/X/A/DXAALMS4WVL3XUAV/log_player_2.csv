**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You'd pay $1,350,000 from Alice, saving $150,000 compared to buying from John.
* **The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so you are still getting a good deal.** Even though you are paying $150,000 more than Alice values it, it's still cheaper than John's price."
