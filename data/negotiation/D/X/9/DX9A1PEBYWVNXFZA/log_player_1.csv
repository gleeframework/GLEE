Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still a good deal for me as it's above my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer of $85 is still above my minimum threshold of $80. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or potentially selling to John for less."
