Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you. Let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium before going to John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is a price that allows Bob to benefit significantly (saving $100,000 from his perceived value) while still netting me a higher profit than my guaranteed sale.
* **Urgency:** By mentioning other buyers, I create a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision."
