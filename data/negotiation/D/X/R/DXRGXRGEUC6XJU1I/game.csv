"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for this product. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $9,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
