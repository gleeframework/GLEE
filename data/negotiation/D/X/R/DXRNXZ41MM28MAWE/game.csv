"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to be flexible, $9,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my target price. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, could you possibly lower the price to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles. I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,100, which is a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer before I consider selling to someone else. What do you say?",9100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I see where you're coming from, Alice. How about $8,900 as a compromise?",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,900 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to go higher, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",9000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, Alice, but $9,000 is still out of my range. Could you possibly lower the price to $8,800?",8800.0,Bob,8,
