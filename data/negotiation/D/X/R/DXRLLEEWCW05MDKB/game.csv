"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's make this happen!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $107.50. Let's make this deal happen.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $108.75? That's a fair price for both of us.",108.75,Alice,5,
