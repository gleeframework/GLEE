"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a strong opening offer that leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good profit. It's important to understand that the value of the product to Bob is unknown, so I need to be aggressive in my opening bid."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  While I could take the $1,200,000, it's less than the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. There's still room to negotiate with Bob, so I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above the guaranteed price from John. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob that allows for a profitable sale without risking losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still below the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. I'm not willing to settle yet, as I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a further compromise, but it's still a good profit for me and closer to my target price.  I'm hoping this will be enough to persuade Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is now equal to the guaranteed price from John.  While I'd prefer more, this is a reasonable outcome considering the potential for further negotiation. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profitable deal."
