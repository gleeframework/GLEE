"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider coming down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $10,500?  This price is still a good deal for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming a bit lower. How about we settle at $10,000? That's the most I'm willing to spend.",10000.0,Bob,4,
