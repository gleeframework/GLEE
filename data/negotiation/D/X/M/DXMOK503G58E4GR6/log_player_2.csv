Alice's offer is higher than what John is offering. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $10,500?  This price is still a good deal for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

While Alice's offer is getting closer to John's price, it's still worth seeing if she'll come down a little further before accepting. There's a chance to save an additional $500."
