Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant returns you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor, Room to Negotiate:**  Starting with a price close to your guaranteed sale value ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. It leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting in the middle at a price still significantly higher than his perceived value.
* **Justify the Value:**  Highlighting the ""value and potential"" subtly reminds Bob of the benefits, even if you don't explicitly state them. This can increase his perceived value.
* **Urgency (Implied):** By not mentioning John, you subtly imply that this offer might not last forever, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just one strategy.  You could explore offering a slightly lower price to increase the likelihood of a quick sale, especially since you have a guaranteed buyer.
* Gauge Bob's personality. If he's known to be a tough negotiator, you might want to start even higher."
