Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $11,000. However, I'm willing to make a small concession. How about we meet at $11,100? It's the closest I can get to your target without sacrificing too much value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $11,100 saves $900 compared to John's offer, and further haggling risks alienating Alice and forcing you to buy from John anyway."
