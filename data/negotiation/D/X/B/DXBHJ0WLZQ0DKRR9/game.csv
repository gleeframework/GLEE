"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. How about $11,500? I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $11,500. How about $12,750? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",12750.0,Alice,5,
