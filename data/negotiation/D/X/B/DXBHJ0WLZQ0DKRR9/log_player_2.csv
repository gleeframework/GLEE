Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $11,500. How about $12,750? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750.

While Alice is coming down in price, she's unlikely to reach my $12,000 limit. It's better to secure the known price from John than risk further negotiation with Alice."
