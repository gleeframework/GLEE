"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm starting with an offer price of $18,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to build rapport with Bob and encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  $18,000 is significantly above my minimum of $12,000, allowing for potential compromises and a successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell. I'm going to counteroffer Bob to see if we can find a middle ground. I'll be using the next round to try and get a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by dropping my price from $18,000 to $15,000. 
* **Middle Ground:** I'm aiming for a middle ground, but still holding out for a price above my minimum. 
* **Reiteration of Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value by saying ""it's a bit too low for me right now.""  
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm staying friendly and encouraging negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $15000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $15000. How about we try $13500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is showing good negotiating skills, and we're getting closer. However, $13,500 is still below my target value. I'm going to counteroffer again, trying to push closer to my desired price.  I'm not yet ready to accept John's offer, as I believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13,500 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference again and go with $14,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I think it would be a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 14250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Continuing Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by further reducing my price.
* **Split the Difference:** I'm suggesting a middle ground between Bob's last offer and my previous offer. This demonstrates that I'm actively working towards a solution.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a fair deal for both parties, further encouraging Bob to accept. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $14250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $13750, but no higher. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're getting very close to my minimum, and it seems like Bob is firm on his offer.  Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids risking further negotiation.  While I'd prefer a higher price, the likelihood of getting more from Bob is decreasing.  It's also important to remember that if I reject Bob's offer, I might not be able to get a better offer in the remaining rounds, and I could end up selling to John for my minimum price."
