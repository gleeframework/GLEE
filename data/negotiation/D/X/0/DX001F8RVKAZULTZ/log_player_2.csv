"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, as that's the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price of $1,000,000.  While it's a compromise, there's room for further negotiation. Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to try and drive the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway on our last offers and go with $1,050,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while still keeping within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting closer, Bob. I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  While it's closer to his ideal price,  the negotiation has taken several rounds and there's no guarantee that Alice will further reduce the price. 

At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. This guarantees the best price within his budget and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
