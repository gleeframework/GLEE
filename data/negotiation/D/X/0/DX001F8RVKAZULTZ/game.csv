"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, as that's the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway on our last offers and go with $1,050,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while still keeping within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting closer, Bob. I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me.
