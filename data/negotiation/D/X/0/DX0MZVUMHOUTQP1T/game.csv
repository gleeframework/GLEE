"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $140. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $130. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",130.0,Alice,5,
