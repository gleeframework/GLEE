Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below my minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting me closer to my desired profit margin.
* **Alternative Option:** I have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so I'm not pressured to accept anything less."
