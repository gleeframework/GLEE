"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects that value.  My asking price is $12,000. This represents a significant discount from the product's full market value, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
