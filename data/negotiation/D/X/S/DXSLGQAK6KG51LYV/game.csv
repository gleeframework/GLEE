"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that initial price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay.  This product is valuable, but  $2,300,000 is not a realistic starting point for me.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but my initial price reflects the true value of this product.  While I am open to negotiation, $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this offer represents a significant compromise and a fair deal for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but there's still a significant gap between our valuations. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000, but that's my limit for now.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the market and potential alternatives.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to make another move to bridge the gap, but it's important for me to find a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'll come down to $1,750,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope it demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated, but your current offer is still outside of what I can consider.  To be frank, I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for this product, which is my absolute limit.  If this works for you, I'm ready to close the deal today.  If not, I'll need to seriously explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
