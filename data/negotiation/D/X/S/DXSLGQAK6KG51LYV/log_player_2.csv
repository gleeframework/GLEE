"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum budget. It's important to negotiate a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, that initial price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay.  This product is valuable, but  $2,300,000 is not a realistic starting point for me.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Counter:** I'm starting with an aggressive counteroffer to signal that Alice's initial price was far off the mark.  I need to bring her expectations down significantly.
* **Within Budget:** This offer is still comfortably within my $1,000,000 budget.
* **Room to Negotiate:**  There's room to increase my offer later in the negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but my initial price reflects the true value of this product.  While I am open to negotiation, $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this offer represents a significant compromise and a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down, $2,000,000 is still double my maximum budget.  I need to show her I'm serious about a much lower price.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Her willingness to negotiate indicates potential for a deal, but I have to stay firm.
* **John as Backup:** I have the option of buying from John for $1,000,000, so there's no need to rush into accepting an overpriced deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but there's still a significant gap between our valuations. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000, but that's my limit for now.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the market and potential alternatives."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness:** Increasing my offer to $900,000 demonstrates that I am willing to move towards a compromise, but I'm setting a firm limit to manage Alice's expectations.
* **Justify Price:**  By mentioning ""market"" and ""alternatives,"" I'm subtly reminding Alice that she isn't my only option, putting some pressure on her to be more reasonable.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  I'm still a good distance below my $1,000,000 maximum, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see that we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to make another move to bridge the gap, but it's important for me to find a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'll come down to $1,750,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope it demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice is coming down, but at this rate, we're unlikely to reach a price I'm comfortable with within the remaining rounds.
* **Alternative Option:**  The option to buy from John for $1,000,000 is looking increasingly attractive. 
* **Maintain Pressure:** I need to signal to Alice that her offers are not close enough to my range. A firm rejection might encourage her to make a more substantial move next round."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated, but your current offer is still outside of what I can consider.  To be frank, I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for this product, which is my absolute limit.  If this works for you, I'm ready to close the deal today.  If not, I'll need to seriously explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** It's time to be transparent with Alice. I'm presenting my maximum budget and framing it as a take-it-or-leave-it offer.
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning ""other options,"" I'm subtly reminding Alice about John and the limited number of rounds remaining.
* **Clear Expectations:**  This firm stance could lead to one of two outcomes:  Alice accepts and we have a deal, or she counters with a number closer to my range. Either way, the negotiation should advance significantly in the next round."
