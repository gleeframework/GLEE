Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's highly valuable to you, and I believe a fair price is $1,500,000. This offer is only valid for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, giving you a strong starting point for negotiation.
* **Time Pressure:**  The 24-hour limit creates urgency and might incentivize Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit by testing Bob's willingness to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything, as John provides a guaranteed sale at your minimum acceptable price."
