"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You want to save as much money as possible, and $50 is still a good deal. However, there's a chance you can get it for even less. Rejecting the offer allows you to explore if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 40} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to gauge her willingness to negotiate. $40 is still a good deal for me, but it leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $45. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $45
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price from $50 to $45.  This is a good deal for me, as I'm willing to pay up to $80.  Accepting her offer saves me $35 compared to buying from John. There's always a chance I could get it for less, but the risk of losing the deal altogether is too high."
