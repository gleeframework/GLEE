"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $120.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build rapport by highlighting the value the product could bring to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $95. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price range. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  This would still represent a significant savings for you compared to the value you placed on the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value you place on this product. I would like to counteroffer at $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $100 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum price of $80 and only $5 away from my last counteroffer. It's better to accept this offer and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
