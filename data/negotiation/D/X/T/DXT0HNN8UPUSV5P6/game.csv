"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I recognize its value, $1100000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $900000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also acknowledging your budget constraints.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1050000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high. I'm willing to offer $950000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $950000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1030000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1030000.0,Alice,5,
