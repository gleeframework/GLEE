Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate down.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  This leaves room for potential counteroffers without compromising your minimum acceptable price. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This ensures Bob understands the offer immediately.

This strategy allows you to gauge Bob's interest while still keeping your options open to sell to John for a higher price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can maintain my position and try to negotiate a higher price.  It's also possible that Bob will increase his offer in the next round to avoid losing the deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000.  This is a good compromise and gives you a significant discount. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers, so I'd like to propose a price of $10,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than my desired outcome.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. It's possible that Bob is willing to increase his offer further, especially since I've demonstrated a willingness to compromise. It's also important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."

Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11500}
