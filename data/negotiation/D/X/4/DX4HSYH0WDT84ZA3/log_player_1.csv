Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($10,000) to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  This gives me some room to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value, and I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $1,000 below my minimum acceptable value. Given that I'm already in the third round of negotiation, it's likely that further negotiation will be time-consuming and may not yield a significantly better result. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale close to my minimum threshold and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a worse outcome or losing the sale altogether."
