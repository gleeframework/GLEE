Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, knowing Bob values it less. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob, but I'm prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows flexibility while maintaining a profitable price for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue to counter-offer, it's unlikely he'll go any higher.  John is offering my minimum acceptable price, so it's the most sensible option at this point."
