Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my own valuation of the product, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while ensuring I get a good deal.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still a bit too high.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,075,000.  This feels like a fair price considering our individual valuations of the product.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, holding out for the full $1,200,000 from John is the best move.  The potential gain from further negotiation with Bob is outweighed by the guaranteed sale at my desired price with John."
