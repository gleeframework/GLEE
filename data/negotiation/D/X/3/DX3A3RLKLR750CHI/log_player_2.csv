"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $13,500 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It makes no sense to accept it at this point.  Bob should reject the offer and see if he can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, immediately pushing the price down to a range closer to his maximum budget.  He shows he's serious about buying the product but isn't willing to pay Alice's asking price. This move sets the tone for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is quite a bit below what I'm hoping for.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'd find it worth the investment. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000, even though it's a significant step down from her initial offer. Bob should reject this offer and try to lower the price further.  There are still rounds remaining, and he's shown a willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $11,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $9,500.  This shows I'm serious about making this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of getting the price below his maximum budget of $8,000.  He's making a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still keeping some wiggle room. This strategy helps maintain momentum in the negotiation."
