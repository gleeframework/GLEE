"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1350000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $1100000. Can you consider that?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer, Bob! However, $1100000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I can offer you a compromise of $1200000, but I'll throw in a bonus: I'll include an additional service that's worth $50000. This way, you'll get the product and a valuable extra feature. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the additional service, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1100000, and I'd like to keep the additional service as part of the deal. Can you consider that?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $1200000, Bob. However, I'm willing to throw in another bonus: I'll give you a 2-year warranty on the product, which is worth at least $20000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the warranty offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, and I'd like to keep the additional service and warranty as part of the deal. Can you consider that?",1050000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'll meet you at $1100000, but I'll throw in a premium support package that's worth at least $50000. This is my absolute final offer. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,9,
