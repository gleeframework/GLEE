"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering it to you for $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $825,000, which is a significant discount from the original price. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Would you consider $760,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825,000 and $760,000. I can offer it to you for $792,500. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us.",792500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to bump my offer up slightly to meet you closer to the middle. How about $780,000?",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. I can see that you're serious about purchasing the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $785,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",785000.0,Alice,7,
