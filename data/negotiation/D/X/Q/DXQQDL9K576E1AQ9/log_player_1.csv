Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,900. I believe it offers significant value, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 11900
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still exceeding her minimum selling price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer. Alice can then slightly reduce the price, potentially securing a deal above her minimum. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000. This gives her leverage to be firm with Bob if needed.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice is unaware of Bob's exact valuation of the product."
