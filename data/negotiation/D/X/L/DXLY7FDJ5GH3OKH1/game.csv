"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad we could have a discussion about the price. However, I'm not quite willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1800000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your compromise, Alice, but $1800000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I'd like to propose a price of $1500000. Can we meet at this price?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1500000 is a significant reduction from our previous discussions, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I need to make a small adjustment to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1550000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1550000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up by a small amount, but I'd like to propose a price of $1525000. Can we meet at this price?",1525000.0,Bob,6,
