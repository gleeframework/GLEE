"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering its worth.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm more comfortable starting at a figure closer to its actual market value. How about we discuss a price around $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the product's value. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues its unique features and potential benefits. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,200,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price, but $1,200,000 is still more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm serious about purchasing this product, but I need to see a price that reflects a realistic market value. Could we consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing your commitment to this purchase, but there's still a significant gap between our positions. I'm prepared to make another move, but it needs to be substantial. To be clear, this product holds significant value beyond typical market comparisons. If we're going to make this work, I propose $1,000,000. This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
