"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! $115 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to do $105? I'm really interested in the product but I'm on a bit of a budget.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is still a little low for me.  How about $110? That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference and go with $107.50?  That's fair for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",107.5,Bob,4,
