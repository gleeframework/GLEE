"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is too far below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my value for the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
