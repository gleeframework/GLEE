"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $14,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth at least $15,000 to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. It makes sense to negotiate for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We begin with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's starting price but higher than our fallback option (John's price). This tactic leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:** The message aims to maintain a positive tone while expressing our interest. We provide a reason for the counteroffer, making it seem more justifiable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is too far below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our fallback price. There's no point in further negotiation or going with John since we've achieved our goal of not spending more than $12,000."
