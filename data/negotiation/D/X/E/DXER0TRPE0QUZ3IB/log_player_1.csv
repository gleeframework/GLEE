"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 9500} 

I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than my minimum, given the product is worth $10,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can reach a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the first offer, but still keeping it above Bob's counteroffer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise but also signals that I'm confident in the value of the product.  I believe this price is reasonable and could lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but just slightly.  I'm showing flexibility but still maintaining a price that's above Bob's latest offer and closer to my desired range.  I hope this will entice Bob to accept the offer, as it's a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal for me.  I've reached the middle of the negotiation and it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. There's a chance Bob could walk away, and I don't want to risk selling to John for a lower price."
