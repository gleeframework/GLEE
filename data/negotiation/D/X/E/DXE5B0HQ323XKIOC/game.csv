"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a good starting point, it's unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would still be a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I'm really interested in it, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,500 is still too far below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,500. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it still represents a great value for you.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm confident this is a good offer for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $9,500, which would be $10,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",10000.0,Bob,6,
