{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum price of $15,000, but it's still a reasonable amount, considering the product's value to Bob.  By offering a lower price initially, I increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer. If he rejects it, I can then adjust my counteroffers based on his responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept such a low price.  It's important to maintain my value and try to negotiate a better deal. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a good starting point, it's unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would still be a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I'm really interested in it, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still too low. I'm not willing to compromise my value at this point.  I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,500 is still too far below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,500. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it still represents a great value for you.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm confident this is a good offer for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $9,500, which would be $10,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob is now offering $10,000, which is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my target.  Given that I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum price of $15,000, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'm going to sell the product to John and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might result in a lower price."
