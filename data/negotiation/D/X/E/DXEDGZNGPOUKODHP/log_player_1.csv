Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,300,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **Higher than John's Offer:** This price ensures that even if Bob negotiates down, we're still getting a better deal than selling to John.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiating style or financial limitations."
