Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer is time-sensitive as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting you even closer to his valuation. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, making Bob less likely to hesitate.
* **Backup Plan:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 provides a safety net. This offer to Bob significantly surpasses that amount."
