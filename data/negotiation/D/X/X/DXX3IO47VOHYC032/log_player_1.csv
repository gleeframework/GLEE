"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. There are still 8 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm countering with $975,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still being closer to my desired price point. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and close the deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm feeling the pressure to close a deal, $925,000 is still too low for me.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round. There's still a lot of negotiation left to do."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and counter with $950,000. This shows a willingness to compromise, and hopefully, Bob will finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and I'm running out of time.  I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a better deal from Bob.  To avoid losing out on a guaranteed $1,200,000, I'm going to sell to John."
