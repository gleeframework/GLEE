"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Directness:** I'm stating the price upfront to be clear about my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit too high for my budget, could you do it for $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I believe there is room for further negotiation. I will counteroffer in the next round to try and find a price we can both agree on. 
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $100 gives me confidence to continue negotiating with Bob.  I'll only choose to sell to John if I feel I can't get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, $60 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a great deal for you, and it's still a fair price for me.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by coming down from my initial offer of $110. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the deal for Bob and using enthusiastic language to create a sense of urgency.
* **Fairness:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, ensuring I'm not losing money on this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I'm still hopeful that I can get a better price from Bob. He's showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **John's offer:** I'm not yet desperate enough to sell to John. I have a few rounds left to try and get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $75 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? This is a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by again meeting Bob halfway, showing I'm serious about reaching an agreement. 
* **Focus on compromise:** I'm highlighting the ""good compromise"" aspect to emphasize the win-win nature of the offer.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm using persuasive language to encourage Bob to accept and close the deal.  

I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price while still leaving room for potential concessions in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the compromise.  How about we settle at $80? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 4 rounds remaining, it's getting riskier to hold out for a higher price.  There's no guarantee I'll be able to get a better offer in the next few rounds.
* **John's Offer:** While John is willing to pay $100, accepting Bob's offer is still a good deal and allows me to close the deal quickly."
