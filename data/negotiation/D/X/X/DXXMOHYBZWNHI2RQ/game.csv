"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special introductory price of $180. It's a one-time offer, and I think you'll really love it.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but $110 is a bit low for me. I can do better than that. How about $155? It's a compromise, but I think you'll find it's worth it.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $145, and that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love the product.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $137.50. This seems like a fair compromise. What do you think?",137.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not quite there. I can do $142, and that's my final offer. If you're interested, this is it.",142.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to go up to $139, but that's my absolute limit.",139.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $139, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one last concession, and I can do $140. That's as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Alice,9,
