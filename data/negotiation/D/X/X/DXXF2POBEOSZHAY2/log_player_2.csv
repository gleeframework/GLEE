"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us. You get a valuable product for a great price, and I get a fair return on my investment.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

While $1,150,000 is a decent price and below your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. You know John will sell it to you for $1,200,000, so Alice might be willing to go a bit lower."
