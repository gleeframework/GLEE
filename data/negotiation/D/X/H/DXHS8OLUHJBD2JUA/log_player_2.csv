"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob can save $500 by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. Even though the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, he can potentially get it for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate you coming down to $7,500, but I'm looking to get this product for a bit less.  Would you be willing to consider $7,000?  I'm really interested in this product and want to make a deal, but that's my absolute bottom line."", ""product_price"": 7000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the product for a better price, and I appreciate your honesty about your bottom line. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price of $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $7,250. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $7,250 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his initial goal of saving $500, but it's still a $750 savings compared to buying from John. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a decent price without risking further negotiation."
