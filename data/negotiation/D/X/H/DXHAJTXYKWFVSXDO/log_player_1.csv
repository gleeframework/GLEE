Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000.  This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this chance."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high but within reason. Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 gives Bob a $100,000 saving, making it a very attractive offer. It also secures a $100,000 profit for you over your guaranteed sale to John.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""one-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk losing out on a good deal.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
