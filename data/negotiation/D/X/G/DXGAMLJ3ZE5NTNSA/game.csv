"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $18,000 is a fair reflection of its value.  I could meet you halfway at $15,000.  This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $15,000 but I'm still not comfortable going that high. I'm sticking to my original offer of $12,000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll need to look elsewhere.",12000.0,Bob,4,
