Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,500 creates a win-win situation if Bob values it at even slightly more than $10,000. He gets a perceived discount, and you make a larger profit than selling to John.
* **Direct Communication:** The message is clear and concise, emphasizing the product's value and offering a chance to buy before wider availability."
