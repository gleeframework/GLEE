,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's close this deal!",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,750 is still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference and settle for $9,125.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",9125.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,900 is still below my bottom line.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!",9000.0,Alice,7,
