"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $850,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $900,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the product's worth.

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a better offer than buying from John, there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a price closer to Bob's initial counteroffer of $850,000. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially achieve a better price."
