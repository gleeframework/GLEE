"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,200,000. It's a significant value for you at that price, and while I know it's worth more to me, I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's value, it's still significantly higher than what John is willing to sell it for. By rejecting this offer, you can move to John and secure the product at a much lower price."
