"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit as well. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my ideal price, it's still better than selling to John for $1,500,000.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great price for a product worth so much to you.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about we split the difference and land at $1,200,000?  That's my best offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is the maximum value he's willing to pay.  At this point, I'm running the risk of further negotiations resulting in a lower price.  Also, selling to John would only net me $1,500,000, which is less than what Bob is offering.  It's time to close the deal."
