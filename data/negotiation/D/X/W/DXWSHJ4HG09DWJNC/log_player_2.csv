"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let you have it for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is the best option. While you could try to haggle Alice down further, $140 is already a good deal and saves you $10 compared to buying from John."
