Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but the price is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a higher price and still have several rounds to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, though. How about $105?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a bit closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 105}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $95 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price. I have several rounds left, and I think I can still get closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to compromise, but $95 is still a little low for me.  Let's meet at $100. That's a fair price for both of us, and it will allow me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
