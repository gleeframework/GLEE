"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know you've been interested in, for a price that I believe will be mutually beneficial.  Let's discuss a price of $1,150,000.  This gives you a significant value gain, and allows me to secure a price well above my minimum. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.
