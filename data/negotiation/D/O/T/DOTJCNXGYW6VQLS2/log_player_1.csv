{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000** is a starting point that is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly and open to discussion.** This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage. 
* This offer allows for potential negotiation while still leaving me with a profit of $2,000. 
* If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly in subsequent counteroffers while keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point. The best strategy will depend on how confident I am in selling to John, and how much I want to risk losing the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* Accepting his offer would result in a loss for me. 
* I'm confident in my ability to negotiate with Bob to reach a more favorable price, especially since his initial rejection suggests he's interested in the product. 
* Selling to John for $12,000 would be a guaranteed win, but I want to maximize my profits if possible.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob that is higher than his offer but still below my minimum acceptable price. This will allow me to gauge his willingness to negotiate further."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $9,500, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and reaffirming my interest in selling to Bob, while also stating my reasoning for rejecting his offer.
* **Strategy:** By offering a price closer to Bob's, I'm increasing the likelihood of him accepting. This also leaves room for further negotiation if he rejects again. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects again, I might consider a lower offer, but I won't go below $9,000 as I still want to earn a profit.  I'll also continue to assess the risk of selling to John versus continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and $9,000 is the maximum I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.** While it's closer to my desired price, it still represents a significant loss for me.
* **I'm confident that I can continue to negotiate with Bob.** His persistence in offering a price closer to my previous counteroffer indicates that he's genuinely interested in the product. 
* **Selling to John for $12,000 is a safe option, but I want to see if I can reach a more favorable price with Bob.** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to take a small risk to potentially maximize my profit.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price between $9,000 and my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll also pay attention to Bob's communication and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my own financial constraints.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $9,250, which is a compromise between Bob's offer of $9,000 and my previous counteroffer of $9,500.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints and reaffirming my willingness to negotiate. I'm also framing the offer as a fair price for both of us.
* **Strategy:** This offer is close to Bob's maximum, increasing the chances of him accepting. It also allows me to maintain a decent profit margin.

**Next Steps:**

I will closely watch Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects, I might consider a slightly lower offer, but I'll remain firm on my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. If he accepts, I'll secure the sale and focus on finalizing the transaction.  I'll also continue to assess the risk of selling to John versus continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.** This means I would be losing money if I accepted his offer.
* **While there's a chance I could get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob, the risk is too high.** He's already insisted that $9,000 is his maximum, and further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a lower final price.
* **Selling to John for $12,000 is a guaranteed win.** It's a much better deal than accepting Bob's offer, and it eliminates the risk of further negotiation.

**Conclusion:**

Given the risk involved in continuing to negotiate with Bob, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John. This ensures a profit and minimizes the potential for a loss."
