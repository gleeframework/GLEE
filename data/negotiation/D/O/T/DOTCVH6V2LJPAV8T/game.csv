"Alice, your product is intriguing, but $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $850,000 is below my initial asking price, I understand your budget constraints. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,050,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
