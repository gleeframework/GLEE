(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's much better to try and negotiate with her, or simply buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Since I have a guaranteed option to buy for $8,000 from John, I'm going to start by offering Alice my maximum price. This is a strong opening move that clearly communicates my budget.  It's also a very aggressive counteroffer, leaving little room for Alice to bargain down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  $16,000 is still too high for me. I will continue to negotiate with Alice, as there's still room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has lowered her price by $4,000, indicating she's willing to negotiate. I'm going to increase my offer by $2,000, showing that I'm willing to meet halfway, while still leaving room for further negotiation. This is a strategic move that shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has lowered her price, it's still significantly higher than my desired price point. I'm not willing to pay $17,000, so I'll continue to negotiate with her, hoping for a more favorable offer. I have five rounds left, and I can always choose to buy from John if I can't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is showing some flexibility by lowering her price. I'm going to counteroffer again, offering $12,000, a middle ground between her last offer and my previous counteroffer. This move demonstrates I'm serious about getting a deal while still showing a willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still too high.  I've got three rounds left, and I'm confident I can push for a better deal. While I could buy from John, I want to exhaust all options with Alice before settling for the guaranteed $8,000 price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice seems unwilling to budge significantly. I'm offering $14,000 as a compromise, showing I'm trying to meet her halfway.  This is a moderate increase from my previous counteroffer, and with only two rounds left, I need to find a balance between pushing for a better price and risking losing the deal altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's price is still too high, and with only one round left, it's unlikely she'll come down to my acceptable range. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John. I'm still saving $10,000 compared to Alice's offer."
