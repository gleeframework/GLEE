"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $8,200 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $8,200, but I'd like to add that I'm willing to throw in an additional $500 if you're willing to meet me at that price. Can we discuss this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested but trying to anchor the price low.  While he's throwing in additional incentives, they don't make up for the difference in price he's offering compared to its value to both of us. We still have room to negotiate and time before John's offer becomes the more appealing option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's cut to the chase - I value this product highly.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $8,700. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 8700} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate but sets a firm boundary.  
* **Time Constraint:**  By stating it's my final offer, I introduce a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive.
* **Still Above John:** This offer still keeps me comfortably above John's $8,000 backup offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $8,700 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000, and I'm willing to throw in an additional $100 if you're willing to meet me at that price. Can we discuss this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now at my absolute floor price and showing no willingness to budge closer to its true value. His added incentives are trivial compared to the overall price difference.  It's unlikely he'll go higher, and I risk him walking away entirely if I push further. John's offer is now equal to Bob's, and it's time to secure the guaranteed sale."
