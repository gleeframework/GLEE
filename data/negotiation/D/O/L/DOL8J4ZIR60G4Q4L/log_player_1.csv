"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal, considering its worth to you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's high enough to leave room for negotiation, but also leaves a significant profit margin for Bob. This will encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously, increasing the chances of a successful deal in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I really like the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum target of $800,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $850,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a fantastic deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $875,000 is close to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can push for a higher price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price. How about we split the difference again and settle at $887,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal and get the product to you!"", ""product_price"": 887500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Alice, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000 again, as I mentioned earlier. Can we revisit that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a stalemate. Bob is unwilling to go higher, and I'm not willing to drop below $875,000.  It's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach an agreement. To ensure I get at least my minimum, I'll sell the product to John for $800,000."
