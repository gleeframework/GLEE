"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $200. This is a one-time offer, so if you're interested, please let me know as soon as possible.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $80.  It's the most I can afford, and I really hope we can make this work.",80.0,Bob,4,
