# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $200. This is a one-time offer, so if you're interested, please let me know as soon as possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is far too high. It's better to try to negotiate a better price or buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget of $80. It's worth trying to negotiate further or going with John."
