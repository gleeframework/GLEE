"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I believe its value to you would be even greater.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can make this work.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $950,000 is a good starting point, it doesn't quite meet my needs.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This ensures a fair deal for both of us and allows us to move forward. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective. $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still not there yet. How about $1,000,000?  This price is fair for both of us - I get the product within my budget, and you get a quick sale at your minimum price. Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
