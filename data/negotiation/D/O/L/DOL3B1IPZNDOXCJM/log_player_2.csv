"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire a product that will generate substantial returns. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum price of $1,000,000 and buying from John would cost you more."
