Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value to someone in your position, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential benefits to you."", ""product_price"": 1350000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000.
* **Leaving Money on the Table:** Offering it at $800,000 leaves a significant amount of potential profit for Bob. 
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a higher offer ($1,350,000) allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to bring the price down. It positions the product as a premium item.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000 if Bob declines. 

This strategy maximizes your chances of getting closer to Bob's maximum valuation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum."
