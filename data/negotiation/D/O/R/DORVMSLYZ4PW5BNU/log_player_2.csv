"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to John for $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is $12,500, which is more than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  While Alice mentions selling to John for $12,000, that's irrelevant to Bob's decision.  He can buy from John for $12,000, which is within his budget.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice for Bob."
