Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this is a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale to John for $10,000. This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit if Bob accepts."
