"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a lower price, and I get a quick sale. Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away happy. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to go with another buyer.",925000.0,Alice,5,
