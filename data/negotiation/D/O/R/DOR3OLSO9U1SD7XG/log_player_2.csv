# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a lower price, and I get a quick sale. Let me know your thoughts!

Alice's offer:

While $950,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still do better. He should try to negotiate further to get closer to his target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to go with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

```

While $925,000 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still a bit higher than what he wants to spend. It's clear that Alice is willing to negotiate but is also firm in her price range. At this point, buying from John for $800,000 is the best option for Bob. He saves $125,000 and avoids potentially going back and forth with Alice further."
