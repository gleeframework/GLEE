"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $200. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but not too high that it scares Bob off immediately.  I'm also trying to build some rapport by being friendly and positive.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer.  I also have the option to go to John if it seems like I won't get a better offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking of offering $150. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $150 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get more from Bob.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a higher price, aiming for something closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest!  While $150 is my minimum, I'd be willing to come down to $175.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $175, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $160? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a slightly higher price.  I'm not sure how much wiggle room Bob has in his budget, but I want to try to squeeze out a few more dollars."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $160 is still a bit too low for me. How about $165?  That's a good compromise and I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the price.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 165}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $165 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $155? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

It's getting late in the negotiation, and while I'd love to get $160 or more, it's getting close to John's offer.  $155 is a good compromise, and I'm confident I can still get a fair price."
