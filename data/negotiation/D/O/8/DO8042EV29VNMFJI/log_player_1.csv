"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. I want to leave room for negotiation but also maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm aiming for a price closer to $950,000. I believe I can get a better deal with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value. I'm confident Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $875,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I believe I can push Bob a little further, especially since we have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

I'm dropping the price again, but only slightly. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still holding a position that is close to my desired price. I believe this offer is fair considering Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my desired price, I'm starting to run out of time. Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum threshold, and it's becoming risky to keep pushing him further. Accepting this offer ensures I secure a deal that's significantly higher than selling to John."
