**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer presents a potential return on investment, it exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and purchasing the product from John for $1,500,000 is the most financially advantageous decision."
