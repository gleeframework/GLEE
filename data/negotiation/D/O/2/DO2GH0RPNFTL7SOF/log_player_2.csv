"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that I believe will be highly valuable to your business. While I value this product at no less than $1,500,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.  This price reflects a significant discount and a chance for you to secure a valuable asset at a price below its true worth.  Please let me know your decision by [Date/Time]. If you decline, I will be moving forward with another interested party. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's a discount, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  You can get the product from John for a much better price."
