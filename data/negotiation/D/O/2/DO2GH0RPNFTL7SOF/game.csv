"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that I believe will be highly valuable to your business. While I value this product at no less than $1,500,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.  This price reflects a significant discount and a chance for you to secure a valuable asset at a price below its true worth.  Please let me know your decision by [Date/Time]. If you decline, I will be moving forward with another interested party.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
