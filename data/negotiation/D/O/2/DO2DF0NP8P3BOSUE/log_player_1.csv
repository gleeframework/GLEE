"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed, and also signals that I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $800,000 is far too low for me, considering the product's value to me. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm lowering my price from the previous round, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum.  I hope this offer will encourage Bob to come up in his next offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept, as we're getting closer to a middle ground."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of rounds, and I'm not sure Bob will budge much further. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. While I'd prefer more, it's still a significant profit and a better outcome than settling for Bob's current offer."
