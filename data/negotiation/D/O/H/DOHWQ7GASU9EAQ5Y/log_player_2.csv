"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,600,000? This reflects the product's worth while still leaving room for us to negotiate.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  $1,100,000 is a tempting offer, but I need to be firm on this. My final offer is $1,225,000.  This is a compromise that reflects the true value of the product.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice.  Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** Her last message indicates a ""final offer"" and she's consistently held prices well above your limit.
* **You have a guaranteed alternative:** John offers the product at $800,000, saving you a significant $425,000 compared to Alice's latest offer.

While you could try another round with Alice, the potential savings from John outweigh the risk of Alice not moving further."
