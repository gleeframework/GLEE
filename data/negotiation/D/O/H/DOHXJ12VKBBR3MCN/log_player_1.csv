Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your floor price of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  Bob is willing to pay $10,000, so you have room to negotiate. 
* **It leaves room for compromise:**  If Bob counters, you have space to adjust the price slightly without losing too much profit. 

By offering $9,500, you maximize your chances of getting a good price while also leaving open the possibility of a successful negotiation."
