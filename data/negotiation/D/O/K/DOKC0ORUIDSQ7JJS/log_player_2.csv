"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
We can definitely get a better price than that. Let's start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I see value in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 650000} 

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a significantly lower offer (but not insultingly low) can help gauge Alice's flexibility and set the stage for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but the gap is still a bit wide for me.  How about $725,000?  That feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 725000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Again):**  We're aiming to find a middle ground. By suggesting $725,000, we're splitting the difference between her last offer ($825,000) and our previous counteroffer ($650,000).
* **Signaling Flexibility:**  We want to show Alice that we're willing to move, but we're still aiming for a significant discount.
* **Avoiding Stalemate:**  Making smaller incremental counteroffers can sometimes lead to a negotiation stalemate. This offer is a bit bolder, encouraging Alice to respond in kind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $775,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Let's push a little further. Alice saying it's the lowest she'll go doesn't mean it actually is. We're getting close, though."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm ready to make a move that shows I'm serious. How about $750,000?  That's a firm offer from my side."", ""product_price"": 750000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Again):** This offer represents another attempt to split the difference. It shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Firm Offer:** By stating this is a ""firm offer,"" we're subtly increasing pressure on Alice.  It implies we might be willing to walk away if she doesn't accept. 
* **Time Constraint:** We're over halfway through the negotiation rounds.  Introducing a sense of urgency can help push towards a final decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not willing to accept $750,000. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000, as I mentioned earlier. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. I'm not willing to go any lower than this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

It seems like we've reached Alice's bottom line. Accepting $775,000 is a good deal and saves us $225,000 compared to John's offer."
