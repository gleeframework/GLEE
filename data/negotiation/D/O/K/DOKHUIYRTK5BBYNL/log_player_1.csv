Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe holds significant value. My initial asking price is $1,500,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's potential. Please let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my need to stay within a reasonable budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can squeeze out a better deal. I have 9 rounds left, and I believe there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,000,000 is the absolute minimum I'd accept, I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,200,000 to demonstrate my commitment to making this deal happen. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1000000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident that this product holds significant value. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob is firm on his $1,000,000 offer, I have 6 more rounds to potentially get a better deal. I'm holding out for a higher price, hoping to see if he'll budge. I also need to factor in the risk of losing the deal to John if I keep declining offers."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While I'd prefer a higher price, to show my commitment to making this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve our goals. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your flexibility, $1100000 is still outside my budget.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1000000. This is a fair and reasonable price for the product, and it allows us both to make a profitable deal. Let's work together to find a way to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We are down to our last 4 rounds, and Bob is standing firm at his $1,000,000 offer.  While I would like to get more, there's a significant risk that we won't be able to close the deal.  With only a few rounds left, I'm not confident I can negotiate a higher price. To avoid potentially losing the deal altogether, I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000 to secure a guaranteed sale.  This ensures I get at least my minimum desired price while also minimizing the risk of getting nothing."
