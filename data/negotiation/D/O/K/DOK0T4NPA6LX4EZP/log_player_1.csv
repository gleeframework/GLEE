Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $800000. This reflects my budget and allows for some room for negotiation. Let me know your thoughts.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
