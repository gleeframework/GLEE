"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It has incredible potential and I believe it would be a valuable asset for you. I'm asking for $1000000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $800000. This reflects my budget and allows for some room for negotiation. Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget.  While $800000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down slightly to $900000. This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down.  $900000 is still a bit higher than I can justify at this point.  How about $850000?  This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to move forward.",850000.0,Bob,4,
