# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It has incredible potential and I believe it would be a valuable asset for you. I'm asking for $1000000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's always worth trying to negotiate further.  Since you have a fallback option with John, you're in a good position to try and get a lower price from Alice."

You're still $100,000 above your ideal price. Keep negotiating. You can likely get closer to your target."
