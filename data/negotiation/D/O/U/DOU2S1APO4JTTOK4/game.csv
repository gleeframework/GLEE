"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product,  $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to consider a price of $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the value I see in this product.  I'm eager to make a deal but need to stay within my financial constraints.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  I could consider a price of $1,900,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  While I believe this product holds value,  I'm prepared to offer a final price of $1,100,000.  This represents a significant compromise and reflects the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
