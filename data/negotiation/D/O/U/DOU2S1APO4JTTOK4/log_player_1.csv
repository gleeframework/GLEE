Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product,  $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to consider a price of $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the value I see in this product.  I'm eager to make a deal but need to stay within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

This represents a significant compromise and reflects the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
