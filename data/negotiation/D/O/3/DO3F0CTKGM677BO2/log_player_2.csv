You can do better than $950,000.  There's still room to negotiate with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $900,000. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's still a significant saving compared to Alice's initial offer and John's price."

Alice's offer of $975,000 is a better deal than buying from John for $1,200,000, and is also better than my previous counteroffer. I'm willing to accept it."
