"Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for a starting price of $180. I believe it's a fantastic deal considering its value. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $180 is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to offer $100. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $100 is significantly below its actual worth. How about we meet in the middle at $150? This feels like a fair compromise.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $150 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110. If you're serious about selling, let's meet in the middle.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $130?  That's a reasonable price considering its value.",130.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting close to my limit.  I'm willing to pay $125, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to budge, I'll have to go with another seller.",125.0,Bob,6,
