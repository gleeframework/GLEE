Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation with a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. 

This approach allows for the following potential scenarios:

* **Bob accepts:** Great, you've earned a profit beyond your minimum goal.
* **Bob rejects and counteroffers:** This allows you to assess his seriousness and potentially adjust your own offer based on his willingness to negotiate.
* **Negotiation continues:**  The back-and-forth allows you to gauge Bob's true value and determine if a deal is possible that meets your minimum requirements.
* **Negotiation fails:**  You have the option to move on to John, ensuring you receive your minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,250,000 is closer to your minimum than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below your desired profit margin. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if a better price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's increased willingness to pay while still maintaining a profit for you.  It's a step closer to your minimum desired price, and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's initial valuation, the negotiation seems to be stalling.  It's not clear that Bob is willing to meet my minimum profit requirement, and I can get my desired price from John.  Therefore, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John."
