"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price just for you, Bob. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Offer ($90):** While this is lower than John's price, it's still above Alice's value ($80) and your maximum ($100). 
* **Rejecting might lead to a better deal:** Alice might come back with a lower offer, getting closer to her own valuation.
* **John's Offer ($100):** This is your backup plan. You'll only take this if Alice doesn't give you a better price. 

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you're negotiating for a better price without risking losing the product entirely."
