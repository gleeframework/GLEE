"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $1,800,000.  This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
