"I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $1,250,000 to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can shake on it at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,175,000?  I'm confident this would be a fair deal for both of us.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,175,000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need $1,225,000 to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,225,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer.  This seems like a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
