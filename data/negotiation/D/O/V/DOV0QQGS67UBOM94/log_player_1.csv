Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,999. I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible without going below your minimum ($15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with a high but not outrageous price allows for some back-and-forth if Bob wants to negotiate.
* **Guaranteed Backup:** The offer to John ensures you'll get your minimum price, so there's less pressure to drastically lower the price for Bob.

**Important Note:**  While this strategy aims to maximize profit, there's no guarantee Bob will accept the offer. He might counter-offer, or you might need to slightly adjust the price to close the deal."
