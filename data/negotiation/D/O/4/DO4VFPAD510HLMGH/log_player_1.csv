Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's reaction and potential counter-offers."
