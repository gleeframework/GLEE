"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll see its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is above your maximum price. You should counter-offer with a lower price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards and still potentially secure a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By offering $900,000, you signal that you're serious but also leave space for Alice to counter-offer. 
* **Considering Alternatives:** Remember, you have the option to buy from John at $1,000,000.  This gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $950,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but slowly. While $950,000 is closer to your goal, you still have room to negotiate before reaching John's price. Let's see if we can get Alice to move a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 925000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counter-offer aims to find a compromise by suggesting the midpoint between your previous offer ($900,000) and Alice's current offer ($950,000). 
* **Signaling Willingness to Deal:**  By moving closer to her price, you're showing Alice that you're serious about buying but still want a competitive price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** You're still below your maximum budget and John's offer, giving you some negotiating power."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going that low.  How about we split the difference at $937,500? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $937,500 is a good deal and very close to your ideal price.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might get you a slightly lower price, but there's also the risk that Alice could walk away or hold firm, pushing you closer to John's $1,000,000 offer.
* **Time Value:**  Sometimes it's better to secure a good deal than to risk losing it for a potentially small gain. 

Accepting at $937,500 saves you $62,500 compared to buying from John."
