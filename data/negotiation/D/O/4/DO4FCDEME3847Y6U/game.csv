"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $950,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going that low.  How about we split the difference at $937,500? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think.",937500.0,Alice,5,
