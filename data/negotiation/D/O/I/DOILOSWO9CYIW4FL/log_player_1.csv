Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before anyone else. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $10,000."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim to get the maximum possible price from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at your desired price doesn't mean Bob will immediately accept. There's a chance he might counter-offer, giving you room to negotiate down slightly while still exceeding your minimum. 
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** Offering a significantly lower price might make Bob suspicious or undervalue the product.  

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net, there's always a slight risk Bob might reject the offer. However, aiming high initially gives you the best chance of maximizing your profit."
