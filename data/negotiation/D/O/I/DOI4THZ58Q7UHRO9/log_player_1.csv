"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I believe it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit steep for me. How about $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
Explanation:

While I could try to negotiate for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $130 is a good deal. It's more than my minimum acceptable price ($120) and close to my initial asking price. There's no guarantee I could get a better offer from Bob in subsequent rounds, and it's better to secure a good deal now than risk ending up with John's lower offer.
