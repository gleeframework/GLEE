Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum.  Any deal depends on you leaving some money on the table.

**Strategy**

Since any price below $1,500,000 means accepting less than your guaranteed offer, you need to balance profit with the risk of Bob rejecting your offer.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair offer considering the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:**  The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves you with a substantial profit compared to your alternative.
* **Justification:** Highlighting ""unique value"" and ""significant benefits"" attempts to frame the price in a positive light, even if it's above Bob's initial valuation. 
* **Exclusivity:**  Implying scarcity or a limited-time offer can sometimes nudge buyers towards accepting.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator or very price-sensitive, you might need to lower your ask.
* **Your Risk Tolerance:** How comfortable are you with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer? 

**Outcome**

There's no guarantee Bob will accept. If he's highly rational, he'll decline.  However, negotiation is about more than just numbers â€“  your framing and Bob's perception of value play a role."
