"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, aiming for a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value for Bob, increasing the chances of him engaging in the negotiation.
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, indicating I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Backup option:**  The possibility of selling to John for $1,000,000 is my safety net, giving me leverage to walk away if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:** While $900,000 is a good price, it's still lower than my minimum value of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation leverage:**  I have a strong backup plan with John.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal.
* **Round 3 preparation:** I can use this round to send Bob a counteroffer closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would be a fair compromise that recognizes both our needs. Let's keep the conversation going."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Value emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, justifying my counteroffer.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  $1,100,000 is still above my minimum, and I'm keeping the option to sell to John open.
* **Positive tone:** I'm staying positive to encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Can we try $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:** $950,000 is still below my minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation progress:** While Bob is getting closer, I'm not convinced this is the best I can get. 
* **John's offer:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safer option right now, but I'm still hopeful of getting a better deal with Bob.
* **Counteroffer opportunity:**  Rejecting allows me to send a counteroffer in the next round, potentially narrowing the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and try $1,025,000?  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway (again):** I'm continuing to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate by meeting Bob halfway. 
* **Small compromise:**  I'm only asking for $75,000 more than Bob's offer, which may seem like a small difference compared to the overall price.
* **Value emphasis:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob, justifying my counteroffer.
* **Positive and solution-oriented:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and highlighting my commitment to finding a solution.
* **Leverage:**  I'm still within my minimum price range, and I have John as a backup option if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1025000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Can we try $997500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $997,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $997,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, I'm only $2,500 away from my goal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk of continuing negotiations and Bob backing out or potentially not getting a better offer.
* **John's offer:** John's offer provides a guaranteed $1,000,000, which meets my minimum and is a safer option at this point in the negotiation.
* **Time constraint:** With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not getting a better offer outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price. 

I'm choosing to sell to John to secure a guaranteed, acceptable price within the remaining rounds."
