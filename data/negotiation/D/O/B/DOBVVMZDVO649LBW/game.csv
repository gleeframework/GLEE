"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This would be a fair compromise that recognizes both our needs. Let's keep the conversation going.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and try $1025000?  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
