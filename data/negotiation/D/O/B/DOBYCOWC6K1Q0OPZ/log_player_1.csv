{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for $20,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $20,000, knowing that the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to potentially pique Bob's interest. 

**Important note:** This is just the first offer. Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiating, I'm not willing to sell the product at such a substantial loss.  

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I can make a counteroffer to try and reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to a price I can accept. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm countering with $17,000, which is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer â€“  it gives Bob a good deal while also being a price I can accept.
* **Openness:**  I'm ending with a statement that expresses openness to further discussion and finding a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $14000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $14,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Given that Bob has already rejected my previous offers, it's likely that he's not going to go higher. 

Therefore, it's in my best interest to accept his offer and sell the product for $14,000. This ensures I get a decent price and avoids the risk of losing a sale completely."
