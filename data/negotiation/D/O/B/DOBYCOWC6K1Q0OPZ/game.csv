"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. While $12000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to a price I can accept. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $14000. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",14000.0,Bob,4,
