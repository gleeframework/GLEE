Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to sell it to you for $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However,  $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to sell it to you for $11,000. I'm willing to make another concession and sell it to you for $11,250. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is a good deal for me. It's significantly lower than the $15,000 I would pay John, and it's also within my budget.  There's a chance I could get the price down a bit more, but the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price isn't worth it.  I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal."
