"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to sell it to you for $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However,  $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
