"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I've seen in similar products in the market. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1600000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, but I'm not sure I can stretch any further. I'd like to propose a compromise: $1450000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1450000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1550000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
