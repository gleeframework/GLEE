"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down a bit?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $65. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $82.50. It's a great compromise that still gives you a good deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $75, Bob. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $81. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",81.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $78?",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to meet you at $78, Bob. I'm still a bit above my minimum price, and I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to offer it to you for $79.50. It's a small concession, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",79.5,Alice,7,
