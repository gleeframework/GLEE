Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern about the price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is a good deal for you. It's lower than what John would charge, and you're still getting a good price.  Accepting is the best choice."
