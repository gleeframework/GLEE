"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,200,000 is below its worth to me.  I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value it brings.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
