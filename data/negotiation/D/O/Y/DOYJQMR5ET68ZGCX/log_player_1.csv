"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a million dollars.  This is a bold move, but it allows me to see if Bob is seriously interested and potentially negotiate from there.  If he rejects, I'll gauge his interest and adjust my counter-offer.  I'll keep John's offer as a safety net if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good amount, I believe I can get closer to my target of $1 million. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm confident I can find a middle ground with Bob, and I want to avoid selling to John at his lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000.  This shows Bob I'm serious about reaching a deal, but it's still a fair amount above his offer. I believe this price is attractive to Bob while still allowing me to make a good profit. If he rejects this offer, I'll reassess the situation and consider lowering my price further in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is sticking to his $900,000 offer. While I'd prefer a higher price,  I don't want to risk further negotiations and potentially end up selling to John for less. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a solid profit and allows me to move on."
