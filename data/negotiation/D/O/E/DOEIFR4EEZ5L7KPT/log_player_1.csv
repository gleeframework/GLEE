Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. While it's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $1,250,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire this product at a price below its market value. Please consider my offer carefully."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:** I'm offering the product at $1,250,000. This is a price that is above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Message:** The message is designed to be persuasive, emphasizing the value of the product to Bob and framing the offer as a special opportunity.
* **Strategy:** This approach balances the potential for maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob for $1,250,000, I'm confident that I can secure my minimum price of $1,500,000 from John if Bob declines."
