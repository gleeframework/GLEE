Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's appealing to Bob while still exceeding what you'd get from John. Here's a possible approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase [product name]. This product offers significant value, and I believe it can be a real asset to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested buyers."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Enthusiasm:** Starting with a positive tone can set a good foundation.
* **Value Emphasis:** Remind Bob of the product's benefits without revealing your bottom line.
* **Strong Offer:** $1,350,000 splits the difference between Bob's value and John's offer. 
* **Urgency:**  Letting Bob know others are interested can encourage a quicker decision.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start a bit higher.
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a slightly less aggressive approach might be beneficial. 

**Remember:** This is just one offer strategy.  You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob and the specific negotiation context."
