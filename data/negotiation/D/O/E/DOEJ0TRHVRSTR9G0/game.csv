"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is a bit above my initial target.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your starting point, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet halfway? I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $1,300,000. It's a fair price for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction. What do you say?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
