Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed $800,000 from John, Bob's perceived value is $1,000,000. We want to capture as much of that surplus as possible.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $50,000, a strong incentive to buy. It also gives us a significant profit margin.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, making Bob less likely to hesitate. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
