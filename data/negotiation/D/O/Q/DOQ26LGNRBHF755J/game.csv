"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about $7,000? That's closer to a fair price for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7,000 is still too far below my minimum. How about $8,000? It's a good price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
