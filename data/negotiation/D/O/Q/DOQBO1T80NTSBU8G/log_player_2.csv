Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for a much lower price from John.  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer unless he can negotiate a significantly lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1100000. This is a fair compromise considering the value I believe the product holds. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above his budget and higher than what he can get from John. He should continue negotiating with Alice, aiming for a price closer to his limit."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  It's clear that Alice isn't willing to come down to a price that works for Bob, so it's best to move on and secure the product from John."
