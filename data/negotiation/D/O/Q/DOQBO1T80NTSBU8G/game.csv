"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1200000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1100000. This is a fair compromise considering the value I believe the product holds. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
