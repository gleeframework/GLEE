"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?"",

}

This counter-offer aims to bring the price closer to Alice's valuation while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, however, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposal.  I could consider a price of $1,300,000.  This reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice is coming down, but there's still room for negotiation before we hit John's price. We'll counter-offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $1,500,000. I'd be willing to close the deal with you right now for $1,225,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Pressure:**  By mentioning the other offer, we introduce a sense of urgency and competition.
* **Fairness:** This offer splits the difference between Alice's current offer and our previous counteroffer, suggesting a willingness to compromise. 
* **Close to Alice's Value:**  We're getting very close to Alice's likely ""walk-away"" point of $1,200,000. This increases the chance of her accepting."
