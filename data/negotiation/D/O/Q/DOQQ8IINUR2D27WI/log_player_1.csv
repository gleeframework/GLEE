Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice starts with a strong offer ($1,400,000) closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than her own minimum ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Polite and Professional:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing value and inviting Bob's perspective. This sets a collaborative tone for the negotiation.
* **Strategic Ambiguity:** Alice doesn't reveal her minimum price or John's offer.  This gives her leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly below both Alice's starting price and her minimum acceptable price.  While Alice wants to maximize her profit, accepting such a low offer would leave a lot of money on the table. It's strategically better to counter-offer and try to negotiate a price closer to her target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, however, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposal.  I could consider a price of $1,300,000.  This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  Alice doesn't immediately agree to Bob's low offer but acknowledges his interest. She stands firm on the product's value to justify the higher price.
* **Significant Concession (but not too much):** By coming down $100,000, Alice shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, the new price is still significantly above both Bob's offer and Alice's minimum, leaving room for further bargaining.
* **No Mention of John:** Alice avoids mentioning her alternative buyer, John.  This keeps Bob engaged and doesn't weaken her negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $1,500,000. I'd be willing to close the deal with you right now for $1,225,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's also reasonably close to her initial target, making it a good deal. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  While Alice could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher. Accepting now secures a solid profit and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations. 
* **Competitive Offer:**  Bob revealing his alternative offer of $1,500,000 adds credibility to his claim and suggests he might not go much higher."
