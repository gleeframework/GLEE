Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but it's still above Bob's estimated value of $8,000. This allows for some wiggle room for negotiation and gives Bob a clear incentive to accept.  I'll keep John's offer in mind and adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,000. This is still a good deal for Bob as it's above his estimated value, and it gives me a little more than his last offer. This should keep the negotiation going while still being in a reasonable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, but it's still below what I want. I've already gone through a couple of rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum price.  I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $15,000 by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John."
