"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love.  I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to me. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still potentially earning more than my minimum acceptable price. I'm also trying to build rapport by using positive language and suggesting that the product is a good fit for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, so I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better price. I'll aim for a counteroffer that's closer to my initial price and still within a reasonable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $150.  That's still a great deal for a product of this quality, and it's the lowest I can go.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150} 
```

I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price, but using a friendly tone and framing it as a good deal for Bob.  This hopefully encourages him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $135? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $135 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. I'm willing to negotiate a bit more but I'm not going to settle for less than $150 right now. I'll counteroffer to see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that.  However, $135 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $145, which is a fair price for both of us.  If you're serious about buying this product, I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering $145. It's a compromise, but it still allows me to get closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm also emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price to hopefully encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $135. Would you be willing to meet me at $140? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling it for less than $150. I'll counteroffer again and try to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I'm willing to go down to $142, which is my final offer.  If you're really interested, let's close the deal now. I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 142} 
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I'm still a bit above $135. Would you be willing to meet me at $138? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $138
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of rounds, and Bob is still not willing to meet my minimum acceptable price. It's better to sell the product to John for $150 than to risk getting a lower offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
