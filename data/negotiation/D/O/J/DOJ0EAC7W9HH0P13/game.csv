"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $150.  That's still a great deal for a product of this quality, and it's the lowest I can go.  Let me know if you're interested.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that.  However, $135 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $145, which is a fair price for both of us.  If you're serious about buying this product, I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",145.0,Alice,5,
