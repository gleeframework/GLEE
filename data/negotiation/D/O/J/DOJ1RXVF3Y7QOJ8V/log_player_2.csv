"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and her value. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Alice's valuation. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below my $150 limit.
* **Polite and Positive:**  Maintaining a good rapport with Alice is important.  The tone is friendly and suggests I'm genuinely interested in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer.  While $85 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground.  How about $95? It's still a great deal for you considering the value this product holds! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we're still a good bit above her valuation. I'll reject this offer to signal that I'm looking for a more significant price drop."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price that's significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to her known valuation. 
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** This phrasing creates a sense of compromise and fairness, hopefully encouraging Alice to accept or at least counter with a price closer to my target."
