Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $110? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I'm willing to compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we try $105? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **You're getting a good deal:** $105 is significantly less than your maximum budget of $150 and a decent saving from the initial offer.
* **Time is a factor:** You've already used 5 rounds of negotiation. While you could potentially get the price lower, there's no guarantee Alice will go down further, and you risk reaching a stalemate.  

It's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk missing out entirely."
