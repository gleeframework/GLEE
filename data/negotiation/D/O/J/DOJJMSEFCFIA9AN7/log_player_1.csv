Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd be willing to pay $75 for it.

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $75 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $85?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

Round 4

While $78 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I'll counteroffer in the next round. I'm hoping to get a bit closer to $80."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $82 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd be willing to pay $79 for it. I'm getting close to my budget, and I'd like to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, we're getting close to the end of the rounds, and there's no guarantee he'll budge further. To ensure I don't lose out on a guaranteed $80, I'm going to sell to John."
