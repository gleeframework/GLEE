Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7,500 is still a bit lower than what I need.  How about we settle at $8,250? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny. Let me know what you think.

While Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $8,250. At this point, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed deal from John at $8,000 rather than risk Alice increasing her offer again."
