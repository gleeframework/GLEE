{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him a little room to feel he's getting a good deal, but still leaves significant profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This still allows me to make a decent profit, while giving you a great price.  Let's meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $8,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can sell the product to John for a much better price."
