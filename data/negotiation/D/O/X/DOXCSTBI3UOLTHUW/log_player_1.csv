Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product which I know would be highly beneficial for you.  I'm asking for $12,000,  given its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell it for a minimum of $8,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price closer to Bob's valuation maximizes your profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
