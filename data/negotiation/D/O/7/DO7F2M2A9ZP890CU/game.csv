"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is my best offer.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,025,000. This is a fair price for a product of this caliber.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. How about we split the difference and go with $1,000,000? This is a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
