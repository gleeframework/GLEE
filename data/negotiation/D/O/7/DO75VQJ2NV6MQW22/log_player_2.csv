"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business.  I know it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair for both of us.  Let's talk about a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is full of sales talk, the actual offer of $900,000 is still more than you need to pay.  You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's room to negotiate with Alice or see if she'll lower her price."
