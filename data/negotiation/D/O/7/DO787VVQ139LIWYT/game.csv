"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. Let me see what I can do. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. Would you be interested?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $10,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Could you consider $7,500? That would work much better for me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still in negotiations! I can see you're serious about buying the product, and I appreciate that. However, $7,500 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000. It's a fair price that should work for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close!  I appreciate your flexibility. How about we settle at $8,500?  That's the highest I can go.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I think we're really close now. I can see you're willing to meet me at $8,500, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $9,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,7,
