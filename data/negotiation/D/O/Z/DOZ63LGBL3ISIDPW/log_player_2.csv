Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to meet you halfway. I am willing to consider $14,250 as the price for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point.  While you could potentially continue negotiating, the difference between Alice's offer ($14,250) and your target price ($14,000) is small. It's not worth risking the deal and potentially ending up buying from John for the full $15,000.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product for a reasonable price."
