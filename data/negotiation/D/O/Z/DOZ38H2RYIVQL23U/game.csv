"Alice, $20,000 is way out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $8,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This is a very fair offer, considering the value you'll gain.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $17,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Let's meet in the middle.",10000.0,Bob,4,
