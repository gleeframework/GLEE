Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This is a very fair offer, considering the value you'll gain.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
