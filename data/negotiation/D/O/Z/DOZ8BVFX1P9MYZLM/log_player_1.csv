I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($1,200,000) and leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will be interested in the product, and I'm hoping to get a price closer to my ideal value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his persistent lowball offers are making it clear he's not willing to pay what the product is worth.  I'm going to accept John's offer of $1,200,000 to ensure I get a fair price for the product."
