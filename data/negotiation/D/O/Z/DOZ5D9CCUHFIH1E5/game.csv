"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above a certain price point. How about $11,000? This still gives you a good deal, and allows me to meet my minimum.  Let me know your thoughts.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still hoping to keep the price at $10,000. I've found another seller, John, who is willing to sell the product to me for that amount. Thank you for considering my budget constraints.",10000.0,Bob,4,
