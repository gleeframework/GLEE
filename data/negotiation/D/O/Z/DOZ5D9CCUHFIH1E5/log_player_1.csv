Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This gives you some room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This helps to keep the negotiation moving forward. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above a certain price point. How about $11,000? This still gives you a good deal, and allows me to meet my minimum.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still hoping to keep the price at $10,000. I've found another seller, John, who is willing to sell the product to me for that amount. Thank you for considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is firm on his price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  Selling to John for $15,000 is the best option for me at this point."
