Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer stands until [Date/Time], at which point it will no longer be available. Let me know your thoughts!"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer it to Bob for $1,200,000 (our guaranteed sale price), there's a chance he'd accept a slightly lower price, netting us a higher profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Time Limit:**  Setting a deadline creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision rather than delaying.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible sale price from Bob while still ensuring the product is sold."
