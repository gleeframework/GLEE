"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, hoping to get a good deal.  I'll see what Bob's response is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$110 is below my minimum value. I'll reject the offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm still aiming for a price above my minimum value, but I'm willing to come down a bit to see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price. I'll reject the offer and see if Bob is willing to go higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 122}
```

I'm trying to strike a balance by offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping this will be enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum value, but I'm not confident he'll go any higher.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum value, it's safer to sell to him and guarantee a decent profit."
