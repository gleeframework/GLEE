"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1600000. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value and uniqueness.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing a price of $1000000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1400000, which is still a good deal considering its value and uniqueness. It's the last offer I'm willing to make.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another compromise, Alice. However, $1400000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is the highest I'm willing to pay. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a fair deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
