"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you're interested in, for $140. It's a fantastic deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason: While $140 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price from Alice.  There's room for negotiation.  You are willing to risk losing the deal to try and get a lower price closer to Alice's value."
