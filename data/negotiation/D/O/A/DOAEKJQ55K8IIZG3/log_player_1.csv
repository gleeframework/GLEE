Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you're interested in, for $140. It's a fantastic deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you make a significant profit even if Bob negotiates down a little.  

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
