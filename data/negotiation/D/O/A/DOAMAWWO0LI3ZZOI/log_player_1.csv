Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your reservation price:** $12,000 (You'll sell to John for this)
* **Bob's perceived value:** $10,000 
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $10,000 and $12,000

**Strategy**

You want to get as close to $12,000 as possible without alienating Bob.  Starting high allows room for negotiation.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique features and value, I'm initially setting the price at $11,500. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  The $11,500 offer anchors the negotiation high within the ZOPA. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message keeps the door open for Bob to counter-offer.  This allows you to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Mentioning ""unique features and value"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth, potentially justifying the higher price.

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach. You can adjust the starting price and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale."
