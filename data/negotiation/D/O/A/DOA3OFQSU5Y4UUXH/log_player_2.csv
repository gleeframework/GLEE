"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price. There are still 9 rounds left to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening move, as it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and establishes a starting point for bargaining.  While it's likely Alice will reject this initial offer, it sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  There are still 7 rounds left, so I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,150,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and that I'm willing to compromise. It also leaves room for further negotiation, as it's still below her last offer of $1,300,000.  I believe this counteroffer is within the reasonable range for both parties, considering our remaining rounds and the value of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still $50,000 over my maximum budget.  We have 5 rounds left, which is enough time to try and negotiate a lower price.  I'm still hoping to get a better deal, so I'll continue to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. I'm offering my maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's likely that Alice will accept this offer, as it's just a small amount below her last offer of $1,250,000. If she rejects it, I have the option to buy the product from John for the same price, so there's no further incentive to negotiate."
