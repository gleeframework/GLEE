# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is far too high, and it's definitely worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob, but $12,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is a fair price that I think we can both agree on. What do you think?

While $16,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable spending. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $17,000? This is a bit above your offer, but I'm confident it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

Alice is not budging much, and $17,000 is still too high for me. It's better to buy from John at $10,000 to save the extra money."
