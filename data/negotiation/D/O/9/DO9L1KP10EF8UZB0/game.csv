"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire something worth $1,500,000 to you. I'm confident we can find an agreement that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, $1,300,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm proposing $1,350,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  However, $1,250,000 is still below my minimum.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000. This is a significant offer that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
