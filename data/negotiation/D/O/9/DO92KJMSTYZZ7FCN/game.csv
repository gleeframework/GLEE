"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,200 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think $8,200 is a fair price, but I was hoping to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $9,000 for it. How about we compromise at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  I'm still not quite there on $9,000.  How about we settle on $8,500? This would give you a good profit and is within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target price. How about we try $8,800? It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",8800.0,Alice,5,
