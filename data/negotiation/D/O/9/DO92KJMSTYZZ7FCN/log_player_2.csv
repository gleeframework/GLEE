Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think $8,200 is a fair price, but I was hoping to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $9,000 for it. How about we compromise at $9,000?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, it's still higher than his $8,000 limit.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target price. How about we try $8,800? It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product.

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $8,800 is still above Bob's $8,000 limit.  John is offering the product at Bob's desired price, so it's the best option."
