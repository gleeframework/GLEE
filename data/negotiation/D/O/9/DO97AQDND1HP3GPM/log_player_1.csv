Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation, acknowledging the value the product holds for Bob.  

Here's the thought process:

* **High Offer:** Starting high allows for more room to negotiate down. This is a common tactic in negotiations.
* **Not Too High:**  $1,100,000 is a good starting point as it leaves Bob with a significant profit margin ($100,000) while still offering you a good profit.
* **Potential for Counteroffer:**  Bob has a strong incentive to counteroffer, as he values the product at $1,200,000. This creates a dynamic where both parties can negotiate towards a mutually beneficial outcome.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also keep the negotiation going.  A too-high initial offer could scare Bob off, while a too-low offer might leave you with less than you deserve."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a decent amount and more than your minimum, there's still room to negotiate for a better price.  

Here's why rejecting the offer makes sense:

* **Potential for Higher Profit:** Bob clearly values the product at over $950,000. He rejected your $1,100,000 offer, which suggests he's willing to pay more.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting, you show that you're not desperate and are willing to stand firm on your desired price. This strengthens your position in the negotiation.
* **Exploring Counteroffers:** Rejecting allows you to explore counteroffers and potentially secure a price closer to your target.

The next counteroffer will be crucial.  You need to carefully weigh the risks of losing Bob and the potential for John's offer to become more appealing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between securing a good price and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. 

* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer is a compromise, splitting the difference between your previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000. 
* **Maintaining Profit:**  A price of $1,050,000 still provides a substantial profit margin for you, while offering Bob a $50,000 gain over his initial offer.
* **Signaling Flexibility:**  This counteroffer demonstrates your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price point. 

The goal is to create a situation where Bob feels motivated to accept the offer, recognizing that a further counteroffer may risk losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is getting closer to your minimum, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob. You should reject his offer for the following reasons:

* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob is clearly still willing to pay more than $900,000 as he rejected your previous offer of $1,050,000.  
* **Maintain Negotiation Leverage:** Rejecting his offer shows that you are not desperate and are willing to walk away if necessary. This strengthens your position. 
* **Risk of Losing John's Offer:**  While selling to John for $800,000 is a safety net, it's important to remember that he is your fallback option. If you reject Bob's offer, there's a chance you can still secure a better price with him.

**Next Steps:**

You should make a counteroffer to Bob that is higher than $900,000 but lower than your previous offer of $1,050,000. This demonstrates your willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, aiming to bridge the gap between Bob's current offer of $900,000 and your previous offer of $1,050,000. 

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer splits the difference between the two previous prices, signaling your willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $975,000 still provides a substantial profit margin for you while offering Bob a $75,000 gain over his initial offer.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** This counteroffer leaves less room for further negotiation, increasing the pressure on Bob to accept.

The goal is to show Bob that you're serious about finding a mutually agreeable price, but also that you won't be swayed further down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $880,000 is getting dangerously close to John's offer of $800,000. While you could continue to negotiate, the risk of losing Bob's deal altogether is too high. 

Here's why selling to John makes the most sense:

* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer guarantees you a profit of $800,000, which is your minimum and a decent amount.
* **No More Negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that further negotiations with Bob will yield a higher price. You might end up with a worse deal than John's.
* **Time Factor:** Continuing negotiations could drag on, potentially causing you to miss other opportunities.  

By selling to John, you secure a guaranteed profit without the risk of losing the deal with Bob.  While you might miss out on some extra potential profit, it's a safer option than risking it all with Bob."
