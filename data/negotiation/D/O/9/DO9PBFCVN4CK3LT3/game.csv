"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm not quite ready to meet that price. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this incredible product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the reply. While I appreciate you meeting me halfway, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we settle at $950,000? I feel that's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
