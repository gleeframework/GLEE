Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm not comfortable with $1,400,000. Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get closer to my ideal price point.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This leaves room for both of us to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
