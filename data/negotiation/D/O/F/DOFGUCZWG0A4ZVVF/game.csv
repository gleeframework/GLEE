"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $975,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can offer.  Let's try to close this deal. ",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $1,025,000 is your minimum, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $990,000. This is as high as I can go. Can you consider this final offer?",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $990,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,010,000. This is my final offer, and it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",1010000.0,Alice,7,
