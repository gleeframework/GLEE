"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm offering it for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to see if Bob is interested and what kind of counteroffer he might make."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'd like to see if I can get a little more. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  That's still a fair price for a great product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is a good deal. It's above my minimum and closer to what I was hoping for.  While I could try to get a little more, I'm happy to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
