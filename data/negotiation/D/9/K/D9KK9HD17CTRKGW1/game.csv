"Hi Alice,  $1000000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $600000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to negotiate. I'm prepared to lower my price to $850000.  This reflects the value I believe the product holds for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $850000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go to $750000.  This is my final offer. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your business, $750000 is still not quite meeting my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $825000. This reflects the value I see in our potential partnership and is my final offer. Let me know if you're able to accept.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm really trying to get this deal done, but $825000 is still a bit more than I can afford.  How about we split the difference and settle on $800000?  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for me, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase.",800000.0,Bob,6,
