"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your understanding of the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000 to reflect your budget, but I can't go any lower.  This is still a good deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for significantly less than its true value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
