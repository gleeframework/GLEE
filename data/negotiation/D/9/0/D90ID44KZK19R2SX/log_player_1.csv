"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still a good starting point considering the product is worth $150 to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $130 is tempting, I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better price. I still believe the product is worth more than $130 to Bob, and I have more rounds to try and negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $135. It's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be acceptable to Bob and allow us to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $128. While it's not my ideal price, it's better than selling to John for $120, and we're getting close to the end of our rounds.  I'm confident that we can reach a more favorable outcome in future negotiations with Bob."
