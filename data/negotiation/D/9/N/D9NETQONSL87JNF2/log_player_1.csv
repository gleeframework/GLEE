{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than the maximum Bob is willing to pay. This gives him some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not too far off from $130, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $128? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $128 is just slightly above my minimum,  the negotiation has been going on for a while and I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer completely.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
