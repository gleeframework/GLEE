Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price you've suggested. I would like to propose an offer of $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $2,000,000. This offer reflects the significant value the product will bring to your operations."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I must respectfully decline the $2,000,000 offer. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this figure is more in line with your expectations and within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,500,000 mark I need. John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price, making it the most logical decision at this point."
