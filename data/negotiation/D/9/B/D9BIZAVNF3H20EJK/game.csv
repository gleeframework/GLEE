"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $9,500 is a fair offer, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  How about $10,500?  That gives you a good price and still allows me to make a profit. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,500. Let's split the difference and go with $10,000.  That way, we both walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,4,
