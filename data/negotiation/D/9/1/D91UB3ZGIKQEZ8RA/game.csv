"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $8,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for countering.  While $12,000 is closer, it's still a bit rich for me.  How about $9,500?  That's a significant jump on my end, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise.",11000.0,Alice,5,
