"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its immense value to you, we believe it's only fair to offer it at a price that reflects its true worth. We propose a purchase price of $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product is valuable, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your own valuation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but given the significant value this product holds, I must respectfully decline. I would like to counter with a proposal of $900,000. This price reflects the product's intrinsic value while remaining competitive in the market. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to where I'd like to be, I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a decent profit while staying within my budget.",875000.0,Bob,4,
