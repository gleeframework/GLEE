Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,500,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me.

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value.  However, the product's intrinsic value and potential warrant a higher price.

Alice's offer is still above my budget.  It's good that she's coming down, but we're still pretty far apart.  I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can close the gap further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.

This offer represents a good middle ground and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring it."", ""product_price"": 950000}

# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I value your persistence in this negotiation. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to let go of the product for $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.

Alice is still too high. I can probably get a better price from John, but I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can strike a deal."
