"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,500,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me. This reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value.  However, the product's intrinsic value and potential warrant a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the true worth of what's being offered.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial limitations. This offer represents a good middle ground and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I value your persistence in this negotiation. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to let go of the product for $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  While $1,100,000 is still above my budget, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This offer is within my price range and reflects the value I see in your product.  I believe this is a fair deal for both of us and would be happy to finalize the transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
