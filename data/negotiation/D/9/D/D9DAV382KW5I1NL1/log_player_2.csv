"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be a great fit for you. Given its value, I'm asking for $22,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $22,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $10,000. There's no need to negotiate with Alice at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $22,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $22,000 is reflective of the true value of this product.  To find a middle ground, I could let it go for $18,000. This is a significant reduction and a very competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a lower price than the initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's budget and he can get the product for $10,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I really appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still a bit out of reach for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, $12,000 is significantly below the market value of this product, and I wouldn't be doing myself justice by accepting it.  If you're serious, I'm willing to make my final offer at $16,000. This is a considerable compromise, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy from John.  Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above his budget, and he's already made it clear that he's not willing to go higher than $12,000.  There's a good chance Alice will continue to reject any counteroffers, and the risk of not getting the product is too high.  John is a safe bet at $10,000."
