"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $22,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $22,000 is reflective of the true value of this product.  To find a middle ground, I could let it go for $18,000. This is a significant reduction and a very competitive price.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I really appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still a bit out of reach for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, $12,000 is significantly below the market value of this product, and I wouldn't be doing myself justice by accepting it.  If you're serious, I'm willing to make my final offer at $16,000. This is a considerable compromise, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,5,
