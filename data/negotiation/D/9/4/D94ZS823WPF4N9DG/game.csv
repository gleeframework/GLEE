"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within $15,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $10,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a significant discount for you. This price reflects the value of the product and allows me to reach a fair deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $10,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. It's a good price for you and allows me to secure a deal that's beneficial for me. Let's try to reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,
