It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering gives you the opportunity to potentially save money."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering a significant discount of $30. This is a good starting point for negotiation, and hopefully, Alice will be willing to come down a bit from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has come down a little, but I still think I can get a better price. I'll reject her offer and counter with another lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $125. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a good deal."
