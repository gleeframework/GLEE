Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've done some more research and found out that similar products are available for around $10,500. I am willing to pay $11,000 for your product, which is higher than what I initially offered, but still lower than your asking price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've been pushing Bob as hard as I can, but he's clearly unwilling to go higher than $11,000.  I'm not willing to accept that price, as it's too far below my minimum of $12,000.  Since I'm running out of time and John is offering me a good price, I'm going to sell the product to John."
