"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my value for the product. While $12,000 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10,500 is a good price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to the $15,000 value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down in price. I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial offer though.  How about $11,000?  That would be a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
