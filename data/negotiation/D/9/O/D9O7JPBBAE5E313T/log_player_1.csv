"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $11,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly less than my minimum price of $12,000 but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $10,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and I hope it will encourage him to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $10,000.  This is another compromise, but it's closer to my minimum price and I hope it will show Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. Bob's offers are getting lower, and I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to get a price close to my minimum. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and I'm not willing to risk getting less."
