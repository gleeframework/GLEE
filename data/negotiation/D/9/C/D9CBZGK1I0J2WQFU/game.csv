"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value, but I believe I can't afford $14,000 at the moment. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to my original ask. How about $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I've given this some more thought and I'd like to propose $10,000 as a fair price for the product. This is still lower than your initial offer, but I believe it's a reasonable compromise considering its value. I hope we can agree on this.",10000.0,Bob,4,
