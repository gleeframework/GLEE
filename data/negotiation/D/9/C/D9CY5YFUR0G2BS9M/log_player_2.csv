"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

It's no longer worth negotiating with Alice. She's unlikely to go below $8,000 and you have a guaranteed option with John at that price."
