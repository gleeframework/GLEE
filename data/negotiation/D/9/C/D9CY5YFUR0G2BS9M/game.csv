"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but $6,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $9,000? It's a compromise that still benefits both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $7,500? That feels like a fair price to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still a bit hesitant to accept $7,500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we try $8,800? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8800.0,Alice,5,
