{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts high, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges the value of the product to me while also trying to get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only able to pay up to $150 for the product. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is at the minimum I'm willing to accept, I still believe there's room for a better deal. I'm going to try to get closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested but $150 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $162.50? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 162.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still believe $150 is the most I can realistically pay for this product. Could we possibly meet at $156.25? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $156.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $156.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial offer, Bob's counteroffer is only slightly lower than my minimum.  I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to negotiate.  I'll accept his offer and sell the product for $156.25."
