"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think this is a great price considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000). This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially get a good price.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the value he would receive. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves space for negotiation without immediately hitting my minimum price. 
* **Preparing for Potential Counteroffer:** I'm ready to potentially accept a counteroffer if it's close to my minimum. However, I'm also prepared to make counteroffers to try and maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:** While Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm not willing to sell at such a significant loss yet.
* **Moving Forward with Negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can send a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price. 
* **Weighing Options:** Selling to John is always an option, but I'm prioritizing maximizing my profit and am willing to continue negotiating with Bob for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. Would you consider $13,500? This price reflects the unique value of this product and still gives you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, subtly implying that my counteroffer is still fair, given the worth. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and open tone to encourage further negotiation.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By making this counteroffer, I'm testing the waters and seeing if Bob is willing to budge further. This allows me to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $12800 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $13000 for the product. Can we agree on that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a lower price or a stalemate. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Time is valuable, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the opportunity to sell to John for $15,000, especially with only 6 rounds remaining.
* **Securing a Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and minimizes the risk of losing out on any deal. 

While I would ideally like to get closer to my target price, securing a sale for $13,000 is a good outcome considering the time constraints and potential for a stalled negotiation."
