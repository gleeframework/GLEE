"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but would be willing to pay $75. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not quite ready to sell it to you for $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $82.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product!",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - how about $80? That's fair to both of us and avoids me having to buy from John.",80.0,Bob,4,
