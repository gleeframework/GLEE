"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $9,500.  He is willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice's offer is still above her minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  There's room for negotiation."

Bob still has room to negotiate.  While $9,000 is closer to his desired price point, he can still potentially get it for less. He should continue negotiating."
