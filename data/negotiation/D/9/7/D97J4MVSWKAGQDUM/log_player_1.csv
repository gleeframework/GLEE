{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a significant discount from the product's value to him while still leaving me with a substantial profit. It also opens the door for negotiation, allowing me to gauge his interest and potentially reach a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $800,000.  I believe I can do better.  I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,100,000?  This price would allow me to meet my minimum requirements and still offer you a significant discount from the product's true value to you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,050,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, $1,050,000 is still a good deal for me and more than what I would get from John. It's also clear that Bob is serious about buying the product, so I don't want to risk losing this deal by continuing to negotiate."
