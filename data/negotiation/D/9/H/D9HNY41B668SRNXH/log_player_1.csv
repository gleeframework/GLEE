Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable value. I'm confident that Bob will likely counteroffer, and we can then work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While I'm happy to sell for $1,500,000, I'm not willing to settle immediately.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum price.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise. It's a bit higher than what John is offering, and it's closer to my desired price. I'm going to accept his offer."
