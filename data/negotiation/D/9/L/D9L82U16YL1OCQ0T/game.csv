"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at around $6,000.  Would you be willing to come down significantly on price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down some, Alice.  However, $10,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  Could you do $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8000.0,Alice,5,
