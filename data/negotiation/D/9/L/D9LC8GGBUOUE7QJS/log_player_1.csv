{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other buyers. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,500,000.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to find a price that Bob is willing to pay while exceeding your minimum.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can aim slightly higher than Bob's valuation. By offering the product at $1,300,000:

* You are giving yourself a significant margin above your minimum ($1,300,000 vs. $1,500,000).
* You are still offering Bob a price potentially attractive to him as it's significantly less than your fallback offer.

By framing the offer as exclusive and time-sensitive, you add a sense of urgency to Bob's decision-making process."
