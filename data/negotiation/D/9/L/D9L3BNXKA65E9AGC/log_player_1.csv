I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, but also ensures I make a profit significantly above my minimum. I'm also aware of the potential buyer John, which means I can be more confident in holding out for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $999,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $999,999
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's close to my minimum, I'm confident I can get more.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's offer and my minimum. I'm hoping this will be a more reasonable price for Bob, but I'm also prepared to go back and forth a few more times if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Bob has reached my minimum price, which is the same as what John is offering. I'd rather not risk further negotiation and potentially getting a lower offer, so I'll sell to John."
