Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $1,700,000.  This is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and hopefully gets us closer to my desired $1,500,000.  If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to counter, but ultimately I can always fall back to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'll counter with a price closer to $1,500,000, hoping to close the gap and hopefully avoid having to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $1,550,000.  This is a compromise,  $50,000 above Bob's offer and $50,000 below my ideal price.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly less attractive.  I'm at a point where I'm willing to sell to John and ensure I meet my minimum value.  Further negotiation with Bob might not be fruitful, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal.  John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is more than acceptable."
