I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $9,200 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a bit more. I'm not yet willing to sell to John, as I'd prefer to get as close to my target price as possible."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $9,200 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a little more and offer the product for $9,350.

This is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of time. I'll accept Bob's offer, as I'm not sure I can get much more from him and I want to close the deal before I run out of rounds."
