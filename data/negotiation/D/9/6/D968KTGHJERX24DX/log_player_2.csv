"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal, it's still possible to get a better price. There's room for negotiation, and Bob might be able to secure the product for less than $900,000.  

**Next Steps:**

Bob should make a counteroffer to Alice. He should aim for a price lower than $900,000, but not so low that it's insulting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a good compromise.  It's a significant drop from her original price, and Bob is already getting a good deal.  There's a chance he could get a slightly lower price with further negotiation, but it's not worth the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to pay the full $1,000,000 to John."
