"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $16,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for a product like this.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good strategy to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards and still potentially secure a good deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering $6,000, I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also establishing a firm starting point.
* **Polite and Professional:** Even though I'm countering with a much lower price, I'm maintaining a polite and respectful tone."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is significantly below its value.  I could come down to $14,000.  This product is a great investment, and I'm confident you'll see a return on that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down in price, $14,000 is still significantly higher than my target price of $8,000 and my alternative option with John.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's willingness to move on the price suggests there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Avoid Anchoring Bias:** By consistently rejecting offers in this range, I aim to avoid anchoring the negotiation too close to Alice's initial high offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit.  However, there's still a pretty big gap between our numbers.  To be frank, I'm looking at other options closer to $7,000. If you can't get closer to that range, I might need to explore those alternatives."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Movement:** I'm increasing my offer to $7,000, demonstrating willingness to compromise.
* **Introducing Alternatives:** By mentioning other options, I'm creating a sense of urgency and subtly putting pressure on Alice without being overly aggressive.
* **Clear Target Range:** I'm reiterating my desired price range to keep the negotiation focused."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500? That's a significant reduction on my end, reflecting my desire to do business with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While $10,500 is a significant move from Alice's initial offer, it's still above my $8,000 maximum and my fallback option with John.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Alice is clearly motivated to sell. By rejecting this offer, I want to gauge how much further she's willing to come down. 
* **Time Considerations:**  We're over halfway through the rounds. I need to apply more pressure to avoid getting stuck in an endless loop of minor concessions."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the effort you're putting in to find a compromise. However, to be totally transparent, anything above $8,000 just doesn't make sense for me.  That's my absolute limit, and I do have another option lined up at that price.  If you're able to work within that range, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm presenting my final offer of $8,000, clearly stating it's my absolute limit. 
* **Transparency and Urgency:**  By being upfront about my alternative option and my willingness to close the deal immediately, I'm increasing the pressure on Alice to make a decision.
* **Leaving No Room for Interpretation:** This offer removes any ambiguity and encourages Alice to respond definitively. Either she accepts and we close the deal, or she counters with an alternative that might still be acceptable."
