"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a great price for a product worth more than $15,000. Let's make this deal happen!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  However, $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $12,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.",12500.0,Alice,5,
