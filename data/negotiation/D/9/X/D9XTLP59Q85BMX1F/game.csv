"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'd like to offer you $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. ",850000.0,Bob,2,
