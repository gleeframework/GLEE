Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is a good starting point considering the product is worth $120 to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation. 
* **Open to Counteroffer:** My message doesn't shut down the possibility of a counteroffer, leaving the door open for a successful deal.

This approach aims to maximize profit while allowing for flexibility in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit:** Bob's offer of $90 is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting his offer guarantees a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation.
* **Time Efficiency:** Selling to Bob now saves time and effort compared to engaging in a potentially lengthy negotiation."
