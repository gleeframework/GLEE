"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $1,200,000? I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your perspective, Bob. However, the value of this product extends far beyond your initial assessment. It has the potential to significantly benefit your business in ways you may not have considered yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This is my final offer.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price at $1,800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
