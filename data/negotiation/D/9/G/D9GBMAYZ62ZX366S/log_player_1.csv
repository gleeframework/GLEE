I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum value of $12,000.  I'll be ready to adjust my price based on Bob's response, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd like to sell the product, $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'll counteroffer to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm countering with $13,000. This is still above my minimum value but shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this price will be more appealing to Bob while still being a profitable deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower.  I'm not willing to go lower than $12,000, which is my minimum value.  It's time to move on and sell the product to John."
