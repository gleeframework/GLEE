Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $175. Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible. Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $150 (John), you can aim higher with Bob.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A price of $175 offers a reasonable markup without being exorbitant. It leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a fair deal while still netting you a profit. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is direct and avoids unnecessary complexity. Bob understands the value proposition and the call to action."
