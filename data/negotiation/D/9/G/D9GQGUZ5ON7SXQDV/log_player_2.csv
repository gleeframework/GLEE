"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better for you:**  You value the product at $1,000,000, and Alice is offering it for $950,000. This means you'll save $50,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer is worse:**  Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll have to buy from John at a higher price, costing you more."
