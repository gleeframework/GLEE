"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $850000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go any lower than $900000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.
