"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I really think that's the highest I can go.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $850000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go any lower than $900000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $880000, but that's as high as I can go.",880000.0,Bob,4,
