Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to move from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the movement. To be honest, $1,075,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about $950,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, indicating he is willing to pay more. We are still significantly above John's offer, so it's worth continuing the negotiation for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the value of this product goes beyond $950,000.  I'm willing to accept $1,025,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer."", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Pressure:** By introducing the ""final offer"" and mentioning another buyer, we create a sense of urgency and scarcity.  This can nudge Bob towards a decision.
* **Incremental Concessions:**  We are still making concessions, but they are getting smaller.  This signals that we are getting closer to our bottom line. 
* **Above Reserve Price:**  We are still aiming for a price significantly above John's offer, maximizing potential profit."
