Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce that the price is justified. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  Phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" invite Bob to engage in the negotiation process rather than just giving a yes or no answer.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You know you have John as a backup, but maximizing your profit with Bob is the primary goal."
