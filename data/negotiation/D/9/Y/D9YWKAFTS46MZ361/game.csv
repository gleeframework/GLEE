"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $110, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider that?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $90 is lower than my initial offer, it's still not quite where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle at $100? This would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider that?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and $85 is closer to your budget. However, I still need to make a profit on this product. Let's compromise at $95. This would be a great price for you and still allow me to earn a reasonable amount.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $87.50 for the product. Can you consider that?",87.5,Bob,6,
