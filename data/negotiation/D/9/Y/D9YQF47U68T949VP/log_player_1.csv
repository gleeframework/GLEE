I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value, but it still leaves room for negotiation. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Risk vs Reward:**  While there's a risk Bob might reject the offer, the potential reward of earning $300,000 more than my guaranteed value from John is worthwhile.
* **Leveraging John:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me confidence to ask for a higher price from Bob. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  This initial offer allows for negotiation. Bob might counter with a lower price, and we can then explore a compromise.

I'm optimistic that this approach will maximize my chances of getting a good price for the product."
