"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500.  This represents a significant potential gain for you, given its worth to you is $15,000.  Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to me is $15,000, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $11,750? This would still be a very good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",11750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to pay $11,200 for the product. I think it's a fair compromise considering the value it holds for me.",11200.0,Bob,4,
