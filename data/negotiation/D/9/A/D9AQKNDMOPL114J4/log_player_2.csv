"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this high-quality item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's start the negotiation. Alice's first offer is higher than her value, leaving room for us to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

We start with a significantly lower offer to gauge Alice's flexibility and leave room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving towards a more agreeable price, but we still have room to negotiate. Let's see if we can bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $6,800. Would that be feasible?"",
""product_price"": 6800
}
```

We acknowledge Alice's effort to meet in the middle while still pushing for a lower price closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm still looking to make a decent profit. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $7,200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is slowly coming down, but we're getting close to a price point where we might consider John's offer.  Let's make one more counter-offer to see if we can close the deal favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle this right now at $7,000?  It's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

We're nearing the end of the negotiation and need to decide if we're willing to take John's offer soon. This counter-offer represents a strong but fair offer, and hopefully, Alice sees the value in closing the deal now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $7,000. I'm willing to meet you at $7,100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly holding her ground but has shown she's willing to negotiate.  $7,100 is a reasonable price, and continuing to push might lead to us losing the deal altogether. It's time to accept and secure the product at a significant savings compared to John's offer."
