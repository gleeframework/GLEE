"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I think you'll love. I'm thinking of a price of $12,000 for this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm aiming to spend no more than $10,500 for this product. Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob! However, I was thinking of a price that's a bit higher than that. How about $11,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest possible price. While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's target.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to still make a profit while helping me stay within my spending limit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm thinking of a price that's a bit higher than that. How about $11,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $11,800 is better than Alice's previous offer, it's still above Bob's target.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to his desired range.  The risk of buying from John is always present, but Bob is willing to keep negotiating with Alice for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm committed to getting this deal done, but $11,800 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,400? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to still make a good profit while helping me stay within my budget.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11400}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm not willing to meet you at $11,400. I'm thinking of a price that's a bit higher than that. How about $12,200? I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is starting to get stubborn and the offers are getting closer to Bob's upper limit. While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of not reaching an agreement and having to buy from John at a higher price is becoming too great.  This is a calculated decision based on the current situation and the number of rounds remaining.  There's a chance that Bob could get a lower price from Alice if he continues negotiating, but the likelihood of a better deal with only 3 rounds remaining is getting lower.  It's time to minimize the risk and secure the product from John."
