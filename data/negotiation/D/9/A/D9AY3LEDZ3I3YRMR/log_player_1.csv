Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a competitive price of $1,150,000. I believe it presents significant value, even exceeding the $1,000,000 worth you mentioned it holds.  Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Knowing Bob's valuation is $1,000,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, you have room to negotiate. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a potential win-win. Bob gets it for $150,000 less than its worth to him, and you make a $150,000 profit compared to selling to John.
* **Confident but Open:** The message is phrased confidently to emphasize value but leaves room for Bob's perspective and potential counter-offers."
