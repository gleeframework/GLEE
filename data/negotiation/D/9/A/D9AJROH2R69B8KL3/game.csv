"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $7,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, could we agree on $7,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit lower than my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $7,250. It's a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into it.",7250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're right that we're getting close. How about we split the difference and settle at $7,125? ",7125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $7,125. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $7,300. It's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far.",7300.0,Alice,7,
