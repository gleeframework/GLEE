"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand where you're coming from, but the value of this product to me is quite significant.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,025,000? I believe this represents a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",975000.0,Bob,4,
