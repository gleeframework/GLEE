"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10000 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $14000?  This still gives you a good deal and is closer to what I need.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $13000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  At this point, Alice is not willing to go lower than $13,000, which is still above Bob's preferred price.  John is offering a much better deal at $10,000, and Bob should take advantage of it to avoid further negotiation."
