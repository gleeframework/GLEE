Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  This offer leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without making it seem like I'm being unreasonable.
* **Protecting My Minimum:** This offer is still above my minimum threshold of $12,000, giving me some flexibility in case Bob wants to negotiate further. 

**Important Note:**  I will monitor Bob's response carefully and be prepared to either negotiate further or accept his counteroffer if it is close to my minimum value. If negotiations stall, I will move on to John to ensure I get at least my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $8500 for the product.  It's a fair price given my budget and the value I see in it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While I would prefer to sell to John for $12,000, Bob's counteroffer indicates he's willing to negotiate. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I will make a counteroffer closer to my desired price, aiming to find a middle ground. 

**Next Steps:**  I will carefully craft a counteroffer that is above Bob's offer but still within a reasonable range.  I will also consider how much room for negotiation I want to leave based on my confidence in selling to John if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $8,500 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we settle on $9,500?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $9,500 shows I'm willing to compromise but still protects my minimum price. It's a significant increase from Bob's offer, demonstrating my commitment to reaching a fair deal.
* **Value Justification:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob to make him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Flexibility:** This counteroffer leaves room for a small adjustment if needed. 

**Next Steps:** I'll carefully monitor Bob's response. If he rejects this counteroffer, I'll need to weigh the potential of further negotiation with selling to John.  I'll consider how much time I have to negotiate, the likelihood of Bob increasing his offer, and my desire to secure the higher price from John."
