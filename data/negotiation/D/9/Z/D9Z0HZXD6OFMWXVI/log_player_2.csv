"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I believe my product is truly unique and valuable, and I'm willing to start with a price of $800,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can likely get a better deal than $800,000.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit high for me.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $650,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $725,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, but I believe it reflects the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $725,000 is a better price than the initial offer, you can still potentially negotiate a lower price. It's worth seeing if Alice will budge further before considering the $1,200,000 offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $725,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $700,000.  This is a good compromise that leaves room for both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm proposing a price of $750,000. This is still a compromise, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're getting closer, but there's still room to negotiate.  Alice seems more willing to compromise, so it's worth pushing a bit further to see if you can secure a price closer to $700,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position, but $750,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to meet you at $720,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs, and I believe it's a good compromise.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 720000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $720,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm proposing a price of $740,000. This is still a compromise, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $740,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $740,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're getting close to a deal, but it's worth pushing a bit further to see if you can get Alice down to your target price of $720,000.  You have only a few rounds left, so you'll need to make a decision soon about whether to accept Alice's offer or go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility.  I'm willing to go up to $730,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's finish this deal."", ""product_price"": 730000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $730,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm proposing a price of $740,000. This is still a compromise, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $740,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $740,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've reached the final round, and while you could try to negotiate further with Alice, there's a good chance you won't be able to reach a deal.  Since John is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is your maximum price, it's the best option to buy from him. You'll save $460,000 compared to Alice's final offer."
