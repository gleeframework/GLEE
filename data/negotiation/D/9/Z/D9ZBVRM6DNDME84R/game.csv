"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and it fits my budget better.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices. How about we try 87.50? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",87.5,Alice,3,
