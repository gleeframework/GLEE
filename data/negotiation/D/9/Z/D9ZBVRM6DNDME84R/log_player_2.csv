"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good deal, you can potentially get it for even cheaper by making a counteroffer.  You are willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $80, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and it fits my budget better."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices. How about we try 87.50? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $87.50 is a good deal for me. It's still below my maximum price of $100, and closer to my ideal price than John's offer. It's also a compromise from Alice, showing that she is willing to negotiate. There's no guarantee that I can get a lower price by continuing to negotiate, and I risk losing the product to another buyer."
