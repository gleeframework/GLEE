"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $9,500
* **Your maximum willingness to pay:** $10,000
* **John's price:** $10,000

Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll pay $10,000 to John, which is your maximum.  While you can save $500 by buying from Alice, you're still within your budget either way.  Since you want to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer is the best choice."
