""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would significantly benefit you. I'm willing to offer it at a price of $13,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($12,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum ($15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $13,500 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down, but still ensures we make a profit if he accepts outright. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have the safety net of John who will pay $15,000, so we're not desperate and can afford to aim high with Bob.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $13,500. He might try to negotiate lower, in which case we'll need to decide whether to accept a smaller profit or move on to John."
