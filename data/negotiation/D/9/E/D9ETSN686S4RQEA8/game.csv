"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm looking to sell it to you for $15,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me though.  I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $7,000? That would work much better for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to think about my costs. How about we try $8,500? It's a bit closer to what I was thinking, and it's still a good deal for you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really making this difficult for me!  I'm trying to be respectful of your need to make a profit, but $8,500 is really pushing my absolute limit.  Would you consider $7,500? That's the best I can do.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're feeling a bit frustrated, but I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial deal. $7,500 is getting closer, but I still need to make a profit. I can meet you at $8,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a good deal for you, and I think we can work with that.",8000.0,Alice,7,
