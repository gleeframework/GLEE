"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm looking to sell it to you for $15,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. You should reject and counter-offer with a much lower price to start the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me though.  I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $6,000."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a good starting point. It's a significant jump down from Alice's opening offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. By starting low, you're signaling that you're a serious buyer, but also that you're looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $9,000 is still above your ideal price and what John is offering. You should continue negotiating to see if you can get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $7,000? That would work much better for me."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

We are moving closer to a possible deal. By offering $7,000, you're splitting the difference between your last offer and her current price, showing willingness to negotiate while staying within a reasonable range of your target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to think about my costs. How about we try $8,500? It's a bit closer to what I was thinking, and it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a tough choice. Alice is getting very close to John's price, but there's still a chance to save a little more. Since you have rounds to spare, it's worth countering one more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're really making this difficult for me!  I'm trying to be respectful of your need to make a profit, but $8,500 is really pushing my absolute limit.  Would you consider $7,500? That's the best I can do."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

This counter-offer is strategic. You're expressing that you're feeling the pressure, but you're also making a relatively small concession ($500). This signals to Alice that you're serious about buying, but not at any price. This is a good point to stand firm and see what Alice does next."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're feeling a bit frustrated, but I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial deal. $7,500 is getting closer, but I still need to make a profit. I can meet you at $8,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a good deal for you, and I think we can work with that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met your bottom line!  There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as you can't get a better price from John. Accept the offer and consider it a successful negotiation."
