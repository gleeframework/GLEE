{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,750,000 is higher than your minimum of $1,500,000, ensuring you make a profit. 
* **It's within Bob's range:**  $1,750,000 is still lower than Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It's a clear and direct offer:** This sets the tone for the negotiation and gives Bob a clear point of reference. 

Keep in mind that you always have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider something closer to $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for you. 

While selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe option, rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering allows you to potentially negotiate a better price.  It's worth exploring if you can bridge the gap and reach an agreement closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  It's still a good deal for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate while still protecting your minimum price.
* **Fairness:**  $1,400,000 is a halfway point between your previous offer and Bob's offer, creating a sense of fairness. 
* **Reiterate Value:** The message reminds Bob of the product's value, reinforcing your position. 

This counteroffer provides Bob with a reasonable option while still allowing for a profitable deal for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget. While $1,400,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,300,000.  Would you be open to that figure? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to your minimum price, it's still below your desired profit margin. Accepting this offer would mean leaving money on the table. 

You have two options that are both advantageous:

* **Reject and Counter-Offer:** You can counteroffer with a slightly lower price, aiming for a compromise that's closer to your minimum. This keeps the negotiation open and gives you a chance to secure a better price.
* **Sell to John:** If you're not confident in getting a better offer from Bob, you can always sell to John for $1,500,000, ensuring you meet your minimum goal.

Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows you to potentially secure a higher price."

**Explanation:**
