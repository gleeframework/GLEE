"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider something closer to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  It's still a good deal for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget. While $1,400,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,300,000.  Would you be open to that figure?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand you're aiming for $1,300,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about we settle on $1,350,000? It's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for such a valuable product.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
