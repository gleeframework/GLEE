Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so $9,500 is within his range of potential interest.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still a $500 difference between my offer and his perceived value, allowing for some back-and-forth. 
* **It's below my minimum acceptable price:**  This offer is still above my minimum of $10,000.  If Bob rejects it, I can always go to John. 

By offering $9,500, I'm setting the stage for a negotiation that could lead to a good outcome for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering what I'm willing to spend, and I'm sure you'll find it a good deal as well. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm willing to risk a little more negotiation with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price. It's possible he might be willing to move up slightly, and I'm not yet ready to settle for a loss on this deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm offering you the product for $9,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs, and I believe it's a great deal for you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but it's also closer to my minimum acceptable price. By offering $9,000, I'm demonstrating that I'm serious about selling to Bob while still protecting my interests."
