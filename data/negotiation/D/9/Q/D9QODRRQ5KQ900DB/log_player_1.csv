"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, given its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Value:** My message highlights the value of the product to Bob, hoping to make him more willing to pay a higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with an invitation for Bob to respond, emphasizing that I'm open to negotiating. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I aim to maximize my profit while leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects my initial offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating with him or switch to John, who offers a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is too low, it shows that he's willing to negotiate. There's potential to reach a more agreeable price in the next rounds.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** I have John's offer of $1,000,000 as a backup, giving me the flexibility to be firm with Bob.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's initial counteroffer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate and that I'm willing to hold out for a better price.  I'll send a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $600,000 is still too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm confident the product will be worth every penny to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still leaving a substantial margin for profit.  
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, reinforcing the idea that he'll get a good return on his investment.
* **Seeking Common Ground:** The message uses language that suggests a willingness to continue negotiating, hoping to keep Bob engaged.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground.  If Bob rejects it, I'll be more willing to consider selling to John, as the gap between his offer and my minimum is shrinking.  However, I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my desired $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $700,000? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not yet at a point where I need to accept an offer below my minimum.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  I can always choose to sell to John for $1,000,000, which gives me leverage in this negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my target price. I'm confident that I can secure a better price than $700,000, and I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for now."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a fair price given the value this product will bring you. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  I'm narrowing the gap further by dropping my price to $850,000, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value Again:** I reiterate the value the product brings to Bob, hoping to incentivize him to close the deal.
* **Urgency and Compromise:** The message conveys a sense of urgency while emphasizing my willingness to compromise, putting pressure on Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a significant concession, making it a strong offer for Bob.  If he rejects it, I'll be more inclined to sell to John in the next round.  However, I'm hoping to finalize the deal with Bob at a price closer to my ideal, which is just $150,000 less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $750,000. This is my final offer, as I need to stay within my budget.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $750,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Bob's ""Final Offer"":**  Bob's claim of a final offer is a common negotiation tactic. I'm not obligated to accept it.
* **John's Offer Remains:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, which is significantly better than Bob's current offer.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm holding firm to my minimum price. This shows that I'm not desperate and willing to walk away if necessary. In the next round, I'll carefully consider if I want to counteroffer again or simply sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $750,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to make one last concession and offer the product to you for $800,000.  This is the lowest I can go.  If you're truly interested, let's close this deal.  Otherwise, I'll be moving on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** This is my last counteroffer, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my minimum price. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him, reinforcing the benefit of closing the deal. 
* **Imposing Deadline:** The message implies a deadline, suggesting that if Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'll move on to another buyer. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strong compromise, offering Bob a price that's just $100,000 below my minimum.  If he rejects it, I'll sell to John in the next round, securing the guaranteed $1,000,000.  I'm hoping that this final concession will convince Bob to close the deal."
