"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Its value is truly exceptional, and I believe it will be a significant asset to your operations.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet the price of $1,400,000. I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,300,000, as a gesture of good faith.  This price still allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's find common ground and move forward.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value it will bring to my operations.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for,  I need to ensure this deal is truly beneficial for me as well.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This price recognizes the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's seal this deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,260,000, which is as close as I can get to your original offer. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, considering the value the product will bring to my operations.",1260000.0,Bob,6,
