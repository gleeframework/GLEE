``` 

**Reasoning:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $750,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $750,000 is your current limit. However, it's important for me to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile.  I'm proposing $850,000.  Let's work together to find a price that's fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your $800,000 limit.  It's worth trying to negotiate further before potentially resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to stay above $800,000. I'm willing to go a little higher, but $850,000 is still too much for me.  I'm prepared to offer $825,000.  This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}
