"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $750,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy he's interested, $750,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with some counter-negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $750,000 is your current limit. However, it's important for me to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile.  I'm proposing $850,000.  Let's work together to find a price that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to stay above $800,000. I'm willing to go a little higher, but $850,000 is still too much for me.  I'm prepared to offer $825,000.  This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer of $825,000 is within my acceptable range, and it's getting closer to my desired price. While I would love to push for more, I'm concerned about risking the deal entirely. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a good profit."
