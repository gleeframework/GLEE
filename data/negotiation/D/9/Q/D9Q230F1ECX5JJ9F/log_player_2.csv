"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500?"", ""product_price"": 6500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering your offer of $6,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $8,500. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is willing to negotiate, her price of $8,500 is still higher than John's offer of $8,000. It makes more sense to buy from John at this point and save the extra $500."
