"Round 1

You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$500,000 is a very good price, but there's room for negotiation. Since you have 10 rounds, it's worth seeing if you can get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to gauge Alice's interest and see how much room there is for negotiation. I'm aiming to get the price as low as possible, but I'm also aware that I need to be realistic and not risk losing the deal completely.  $300,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but I'm hoping it's enticing enough for her to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $400,000 is a much better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, showing she's willing to negotiate. My counteroffer is a compromise, increasing from my previous offer but still significantly lower than her current price. This shows I'm serious about getting a deal, but also leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$450,000 is a good price, but I'm still hoping to get it lower. I've seen Alice is willing to negotiate, and with several rounds left, I can afford to be patient and push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to inch closer to Alice's price, but still pushing for a better deal. This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a higher price than my previous offer but still lower than Alice's current offer. This keeps the negotiation moving forward and shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is back to the original $500,000.  While I'd prefer a lower price, it's still significantly better than John's offer of $1,200,000.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I risk losing the deal entirely if I keep rejecting offers. It's time to accept and secure the product at a good price."
