"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a great price for the value of this product.  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's find a way to make this work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
