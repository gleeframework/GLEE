Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate but still allows you to earn a significant profit.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're still making a good profit even if Bob accepts this initial offer.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  This sets up a back-and-forth that could potentially lead to a higher price for you.

Remember, you can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what you're willing to accept.  It's worth exploring if you can negotiate a higher price. While selling to John is tempting, you have more leverage to potentially get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a great price for the value of this product.  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:**  You're not giving in entirely to his price.
* **It's lower than your initial offer:** You're showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **It's still above your minimum:**  You're still getting a good price for your product. 

By showing willingness to compromise, you might be able to secure a deal closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,025,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to your desired price and is still above your minimum.  There's a good chance you won't get a better deal, and continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob entirely.  Accepting his offer allows you to secure a good price without risking selling to John for a slightly higher amount."
