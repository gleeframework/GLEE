"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the market value of the product is $1,000,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's more than your maximum budget and more importantly, more than John's offer. By rejecting this offer, you can proceed to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, saving you $200,000."
