Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible while still exceeding our minimum price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, while still ensuring we receive significantly more than John's offer. 
* **Exclusivity Incentive:** Highlighting that this is an exclusive offer before it goes to someone else might make Bob more inclined to accept.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes we have some confidence Bob values the product and might be willing to pay a premium to secure it.
* If we were highly confident Bob wouldn't go above $1,000,000, we could offer it at that price to guarantee the sale. However, the current approach aims for a higher potential profit."
