"I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $13,000 might be a bit high.  However, I'm confident the product's value to you justifies a price closer to my initial offer. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your point, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,500 is simply too low for me. It wouldn't cover my costs and wouldn't reflect the true value of the product. How about we settle on $11,500?  This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing me to make a fair profit while still giving you a great price. Let's close this deal.",11500.0,Alice,5,
