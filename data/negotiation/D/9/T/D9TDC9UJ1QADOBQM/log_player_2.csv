Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $13,000 might be a bit high.  However, I'm confident the product's value to you justifies a price closer to my initial offer. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,500 is simply too low for me. It wouldn't cover my costs and wouldn't reflect the true value of the product. How about we settle on $11,500?  This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing me to make a fair profit while still giving you a great price. Let's close this deal.
