"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? This is still a great deal for you, considering you value the product at $150.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit far from $110. How about we meet in the middle at $105?,105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $105 is still a little lower than what I'm hoping to get. How about we meet at $108? This is a good compromise, and you're still getting a great deal for a product worth $150 to you.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but $108 is still a bit too high for me. How about we try $102?",102.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate, and I appreciate that.  However, $102 is still a little too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $105.  You still get the product for significantly less than what it's worth to you, and I get a fair price for it. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do a bit better than that. How about $103?",103.0,Bob,8,
