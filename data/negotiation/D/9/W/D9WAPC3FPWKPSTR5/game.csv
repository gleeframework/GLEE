"I'm really interested in the product, but $1600000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. How about we meet at $1400000? It's a fair compromise and still a great deal for you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1400000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is the same price I offered earlier. I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you accept this price?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're firm on $1200000, but I'm still not convinced I'm getting the best deal. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'll go a bit higher than that. How about $1350000? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
