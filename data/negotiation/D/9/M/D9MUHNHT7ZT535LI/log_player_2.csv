"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $10,000. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a product that holds significant value for you, considering its worth of $12,000 to you. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price. He values the product at $12,000, so there's room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the introductory price, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $9,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a good deal for you considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to come up with a solution that works for both of us. I am willing to consider $9,750 as the price for the product. This allows for a reasonable profit margin while still providing a good deal for you, given its value to you. I look forward to your consideration of this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,750, which is within Bob's budget and a good deal for him.  While he could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject the counteroffer, and he might end up paying $12,000 to John.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the product for a price that is both fair and within his desired range."
