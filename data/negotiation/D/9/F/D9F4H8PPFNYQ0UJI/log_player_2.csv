# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love! I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can likely get a better price from Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $140 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  How about $130? I'm really interested in the product but my budget is tight."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135.  This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  Accepting the offer at $135 saves you $15 compared to buying from John, and is a good compromise."
