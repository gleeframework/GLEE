Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $90. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you get a price significantly above your minimum ($80). 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John at $80 gives you leverage. You're not desperate, so you can aim higher with Bob."
