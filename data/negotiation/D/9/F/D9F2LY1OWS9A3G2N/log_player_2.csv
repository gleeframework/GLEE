"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $14,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than Alice's asking price of $15,000, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. 

Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There's a chance he might be able to get closer to his desired price. If not, he can always buy from John for $12,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only able to pay $12,500 for the product right now.  This is my best price, and it's still a good deal for you considering you value it at $15,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position, and I would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose to sell the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair compromise, given its worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible deal. While $13,000 is closer to his budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his maximum of $12,000. 

Rejecting this offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate a lower price with Alice. If he can't reach an agreement, he can always buy from John for $12,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to sell the product to you for $12,900. This is the lowest price I can go while still ensuring a reasonable profit for myself. I hope this proposal meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,900 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offers, it's still above his maximum of $12,000.  At this point, Bob has two options:

* **Continue Negotiating:** He can try to negotiate further with Alice, but there's no guarantee she'll go lower. This risks further rounds of negotiation and potentially more time wasted.
* **Buy from John:**  John is offering the product for $12,000, which is within Bob's budget. This is the most guaranteed way for Bob to get the product at his desired price.

Therefore, the most logical decision for Bob is to buy the product from John. This ensures he gets the product at his desired price and avoids further negotiation."
