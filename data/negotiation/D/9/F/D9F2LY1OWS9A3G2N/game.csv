"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only able to pay $12,500 for the product right now.  This is my best price, and it's still a good deal for you considering you value it at $15,000.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position, and I would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose to sell the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair compromise, given its worth to both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,750. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my financial constraints.  What do you say?",12750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to sell the product to you for $12,900. This is the lowest price I can go while still ensuring a reasonable profit for myself. I hope this proposal meets your expectations.",12900.0,Alice,5,
