"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
