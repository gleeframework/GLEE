Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $120.  I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""limited time"" and ""great deal for the value,""  I'm creating a sense of urgency and implying the product is worth more than Bob might think.
* **Backup Plan:** I have John as a backup buyer, guaranteeing me at least $100.  This allows me to be bolder in my offer to Bob."
