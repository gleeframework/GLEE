Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $80.
* **John as Backup:** If Bob declines, I have a guaranteed sale at $120.

By offering the product at $119, I'm aiming for the highest price Bob might be willing to pay while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price. There's a chance Bob might find this price slightly high, but it leaves room for negotiation if needed."
