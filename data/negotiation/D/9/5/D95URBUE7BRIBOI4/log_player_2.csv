"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
Alice's starting price is quite high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me.  How about $5,000?"", 
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a low counter-offer gives us more room to negotiate upwards. This price is significantly below Alice's asking price, but it's a strong starting point. Alice might be willing to come down considerably, especially since her alternative is to keep the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $5,000 is far too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about $9,000?  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $9,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still above our ideal price and John's offer. There's room for Alice to come down further, so we'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That's a significant saving for me, and still a good price for you."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're moving closer to a potential agreement.  $7,000 is a strong offer that's a good compromise between our initial offer and her latest price.  It gives Alice incentive to accept while still saving us a substantial amount compared to her starting price and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $7,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know if you're interested in this final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice seems to be anchored at $10,000, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price.  While we could try to haggle her down a little more, the potential savings are outweighed by the risk of her refusing and us ending up with no deal. John's guaranteed offer of $8,000 becomes the more attractive option at this point."
