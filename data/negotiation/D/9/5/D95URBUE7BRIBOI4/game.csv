"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $5,000 is far too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about $9,000?  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. ",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That's a significant saving for me, and still a good price for you.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $7,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know if you're interested in this final offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
