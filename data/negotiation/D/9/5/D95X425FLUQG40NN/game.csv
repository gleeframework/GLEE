"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still offers you a significant gain, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $950,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers,  at $1,025,000.  This would be a win for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000. That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows how serious I am about getting this deal done.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your increased offer, but it's still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price is fair to both of us, and it would be a great deal for you. Let's finalize this deal before time runs out. ",1000000.0,Alice,7,
