Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially capture a good portion of the surplus value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still less than the $1,000,000 I initially offered.  I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $975,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer and his counteroffer.  I hope this shows my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob seems unwilling to budge further. While $920,000 is still a decent price, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000 to secure a guaranteed sale and avoid the potential risk of Bob continuing to lower his offers."
