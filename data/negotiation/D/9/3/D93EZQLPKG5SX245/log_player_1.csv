Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for $11,999. I believe it's a fantastic deal and would be very valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 11999}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **High Starting Point:** $11,999 is just below your guaranteed price, leaving room for potential negotiation if Bob wants to haggle. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob, hoping to justify the high price.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject this offer.  However, it's a calculated risk to potentially earn an extra $1,999.  If Bob rejects the offer, you still sell to John at your desired minimum."
