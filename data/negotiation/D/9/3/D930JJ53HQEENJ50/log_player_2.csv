"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth discussing. My initial offer for this exceptional item is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Bob is aiming to get the price as close to his target value as possible. $9,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable offer:** This counteroffer is still above Alice's minimum selling point of $8,000.  
* **Setting a tone:** Bob's message is polite but firm, indicating he's prepared to negotiate and isn't afraid to walk away if he doesn't get a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product, I propose we set the price at $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $9,500 is very close to Bob's target value of $9,000.  
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice becoming less willing to sell or even escalating the price. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Spending more time negotiating could mean missing out on a potentially better deal with John, especially if John's offer expires or becomes unavailable. 

By accepting the offer, Bob secures the product at a price he's comfortable with without risking a more expensive outcome or a drawn-out negotiation."
