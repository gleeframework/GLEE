Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $175. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value of $150 but still potentially attractive to Bob. If he rejects it, I'm open to negotiating further, but I also have the option of selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is below my minimum value, so I'm rejecting it. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell for less than $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm offering $160, which is a compromise between my minimum price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, but I'm getting close to my reserve price.  However, since John is offering my reserve price of $150, it makes more sense to sell to him and avoid any further negotiation with Bob."
