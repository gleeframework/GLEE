"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is generous, the true value of this product is significantly higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the unique benefits and potential this product offers.

Alice's offer is still too high, but it's a good sign she's willing to negotiate. I'll try to get closer to my target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $1,900,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but that's my absolute maximum. I'm confident we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. It's clear this could be a real asset to you.  To be frank, I have a hard limit of $1,500,000 for this. I'm willing to let it go at that price as a sign of good faith, but I can't budge any further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and I'm not sure if I can convince her to go lower. I have enough rounds left to negotiate, but it's risky. I'd rather be safe and buy the product from John for a guaranteed price that's within my budget."
