Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. I'm starting with an offer of $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, how about $135? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get closer to my original asking price, $125 is a good price and I'm getting closer to a deal. It's also more than I'd get from John.  I'll continue to negotiate with Bob in future rounds, but for now, I'll lock in this sale."
