# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a bit lower than her product's value to her, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers.  You have a better alternative with John, so rejecting Alice's offer and going with John makes the most financial sense."
