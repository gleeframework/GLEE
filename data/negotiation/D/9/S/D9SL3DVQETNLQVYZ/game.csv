"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $145. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product!",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
It's still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $115?,115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $115, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll meet you at $130. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product!",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $130 is still a bit too high for my budget. I can do $120, and I believe that's a fair offer.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll meet you at $125. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle!",125.0,Alice,7,
