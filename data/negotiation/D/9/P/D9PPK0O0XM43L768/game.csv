"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Would you be open to that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $10500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $9250.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still a bit far from being willing to sell at $9250. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $10000?",10000.0,Alice,5,
