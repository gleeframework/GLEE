Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand this is a significant investment for you, and I appreciate you meeting me closer to my price point.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,300,000. While she might still come down a little in the last round, it's improbable she'll drop to a price that makes staying in the negotiation worthwhile. You can get the product for a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, saving you at least $300,000."
