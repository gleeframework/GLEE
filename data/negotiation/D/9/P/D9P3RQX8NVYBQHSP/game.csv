"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I believe your starting price is quite high. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the initial price.  However, the value this product represents, in terms of potential ROI and unique advantages, is truly significant. I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. I believe this price reflects a more accurate valuation while leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but the gap between our valuations is still quite large. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of the product's value to me. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but I have to be upfront â€“ accepting anything below $1,700,000 would be significantly undervaluing the product. It's not just about the immediate benefits but the long-term potential it holds. I'm open to finding a middle ground, but that's my bottom line.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and respect your bottom line. However, $1,700,000 is still significantly above what I'm comfortable paying. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  This is a substantial increase on my previous offer and demonstrates my seriousness about reaching a deal.  Let's see if we can find a compromise within this range.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting closer. Your commitment to reaching a deal is clear.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,400,000?  This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're definitely in the ballpark now. I appreciate you moving closer to my range.  To bridge the remaining gap, I'm proposing a final offer of $1,200,000.  This represents a significant investment on my part and reflects the upper limit of my budget. Let me know if this works for you.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is a significant investment for you, and I appreciate you meeting me closer to my price point. This product offers immense value, and I want to ensure a fair deal for both of us.  How about we settle at $1,300,000? This feels like a strong and reasonable compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,9,
