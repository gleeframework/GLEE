While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $600,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential return on investment.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your candor. While I'm motivated to find an agreement, the $700,000 offer is too low to consider.  Let's try this â€“ I'm willing to accept $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another interested buyer at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down to her minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).  It's clear she won't go any lower. Since your maximum is $800,000, it's time to cut your losses and buy from John. This avoids further negotiation and secures the product within your budget."
