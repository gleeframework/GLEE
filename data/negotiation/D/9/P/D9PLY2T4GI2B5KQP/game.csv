"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present this opportunity to you. Given the unique value this product offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for presenting this opportunity. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $600,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential return on investment.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer. However, $1,900,000 is still  beyond my budget. To be frank,  $700,000 is the highest I'm willing to go.  If that's not workable, I may have to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your candor. While I'm motivated to find an agreement, the $700,000 offer is too low to consider.  Let's try this â€“ I'm willing to accept $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another interested buyer at this price.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
