Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't proceed with a purchase at $15,000. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12,000. This aligns better with what I am willing to spend. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. I've carefully considered your offer, and while I understand your position, I believe I can't move forward with a purchase at $13,500. To better align with my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12,000. This is the maximum I am willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is firmly rooted at $12,000, which is his perceived value of the product.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price. Since John offers the same amount, it's time to cut losses and move on."
