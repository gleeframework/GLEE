"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Rationale:**

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept it on the first round. This establishes a high starting point for the negotiation and sets the expectation that the product is valuable.  

By offering a price higher than my minimum acceptable value, I create room for negotiation.  This allows for potential counteroffers from Bob and gives me the opportunity to understand his perceived value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Rationale:**

While $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable value, I'm not willing to accept it immediately.  I believe the product holds more value, and I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to secure a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Rationale:**

I'm lowering my offer to $1,200,000, acknowledging that Bob is unlikely to pay my initial asking price.  This demonstrates flexibility, while still leaving room for further negotiation.  This price also allows for potential profit beyond my minimum acceptable value, and it remains significantly higher than Bob's initial offer."
