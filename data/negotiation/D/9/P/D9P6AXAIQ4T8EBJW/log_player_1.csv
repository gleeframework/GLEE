Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll sell to John for $1,500,000 if Bob declines, so this is your fallback position.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is only worth $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,000,001 (one dollar more than Bob's value) and $1,499,999 (one dollar less than your guaranteed sale price to John).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA, but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal.  

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Language:** Using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and highlighting ""unique value"" can make the product seem more desirable.
* **High Anchor:**  $1,350,000 is a strong starting point within the ZOPA. It gives you room to negotiate down if needed, while still exceeding your minimum. 
* **No Justification:** You don't need to explain your pricing.  Let Bob counter if he feels the need to negotiate.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter, and have a negotiation strategy ready.  You may need to be willing to go slightly lower to secure the deal with Bob, but remember, your bottom line is $1,500,000."
