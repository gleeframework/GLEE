Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  I want to get the highest price possible. $12,000 is a good starting point, allowing for some negotiation.
* **John as backup:** I know I have a guaranteed $10,000 from John, so I can afford to be somewhat aggressive with Bob.
* **Uncertainty:** Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm taking a calculated risk with this offer. 

Let's see if Bob bites!"
