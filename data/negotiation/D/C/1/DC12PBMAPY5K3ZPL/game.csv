"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price. What are your thoughts?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,750. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm prepared to go down to $10,000, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price, considering the product's value and the potential for future benefits. Let me know if you're ready to seal the deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $10,000 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more attempt to reach a compromise. I can offer $9,500, which is as low as I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to seal the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",9500.0,Bob,6,
