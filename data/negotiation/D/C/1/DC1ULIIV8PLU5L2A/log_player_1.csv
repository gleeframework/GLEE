Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,600,000. I'm very close to my limit, but I can only offer $1,400,000 at this time.  This is a substantial increase from my previous offer.  I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** At this point, Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. He's made it clear that $1,400,000 is near his limit. Accepting this offer means a $100,000 loss compared to John's guaranteed offer. It's time to cut losses and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
