"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1200000 for this product.  That's a fair price given its value to me.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1300000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1250000.  This would be a significant savings for me, and I believe it's still a fair price for you considering its value to you.  Let's try to bridge the gap.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1250000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  How about $1275000? It's a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
