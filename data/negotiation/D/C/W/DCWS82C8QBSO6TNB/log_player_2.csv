"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We are aiming for a price much lower than $100, so it's best to reject and counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Polite and interested:** We maintain a positive tone and express continued interest in the product.
* **Ambitious but reasonable:** $70 is a significant decrease from Alice's offer, but it's still above her perceived value of the product, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Clear and direct:** We state our desired price directly, making it easy for Alice to understand our position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we still have room to negotiate.  We'll reject and try to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I'm glad we're getting closer. How about we settle in the middle at $77?"",
""product_price"": 77
}
```

Here's our strategy:

* **Show progress:** We acknowledge Alice's movement and express optimism about reaching a deal.
* **Middle ground:** Proposing $77 represents a compromise, splitting the difference between her $85 and our $70.
* **Simple and clear:**  Directly suggesting a specific price keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $77 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to go down to $82. This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to accept.  Alice is clearly holding firm around her value, and $82 is a good price. Further haggling might annoy her and risk the deal."
