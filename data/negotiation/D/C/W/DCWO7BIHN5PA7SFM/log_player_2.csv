# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. I think you'll really love it and it's a steal at this price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice is starting at $9,000.  There's a good chance you could get a better price by rejecting this offer. It's worth seeing if she'll come down closer to her value of $8,000.  You can always fall back on John's $12,000 offer if needed."
