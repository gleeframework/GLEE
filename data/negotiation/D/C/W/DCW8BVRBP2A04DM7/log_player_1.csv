Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it will be highly beneficial for you. I'm willing to offer it at a price of $9,500. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a price point that is likely to be tempting to Bob (as it's significantly less than his perceived value) while still leaving me with a significant profit. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Adding a time constraint can encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially accept the offer."
