"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my value for the product. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to accept $10,500? "", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price as close to Alice's value ($10,000) as possible.  A counteroffer of $10,500 gives Alice a decent profit while still saving Bob a significant amount compared to both John's price and Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, and a good compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is now closer to Bob's preferred price range, and it's still a better deal than buying from John for $12,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to sell, and Bob could end up having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer at $11,000 allows Bob to secure the product at a good price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
