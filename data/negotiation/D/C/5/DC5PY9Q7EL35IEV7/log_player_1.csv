Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value that would benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $11,500 is still a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) and better than John's offer."
