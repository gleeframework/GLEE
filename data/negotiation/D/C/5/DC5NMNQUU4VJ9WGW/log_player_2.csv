"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers unique value, and to reflect that, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise to move the negotiation forward. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty. While $950,000 is closer to what you're looking for, it's still a significant gap from my perspective. To be completely transparent, I have other interested buyers, and I need to be realistic about the value of this product. Would you be willing to consider $1,600,000? This feels like a fair compromise considering the value it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you've been a great potential buyer and I respect that you're sticking to your budget. I've tried to be flexible, but I also have to consider my bottom line. Given everything we've discussed,  I'm willing to accept $1,300,000.  This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to move forward with other buyers.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball and has signaled this is her final offer. While she might be bluffing about other buyers, the price she's offering is still significantly higher than John's offer.  It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations when you have a guaranteed option at $1,000,000."
