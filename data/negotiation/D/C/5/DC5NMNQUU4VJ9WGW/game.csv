"Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm aiming for a price around $2,300,000 for it. What are your initial thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for presenting the product. While I agree it has value, $2,300,000 is quite steep. I'm thinking closer to $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers unique value, and to reflect that, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise to move the negotiation forward. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer.  However, $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  To be frank, I'm considering my other options closer to $950,000. Would you be willing to meet me somewhere near there?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty. While $950,000 is closer to what you're looking for, it's still a significant gap from my perspective. To be completely transparent, I have other interested buyers, and I need to be realistic about the value of this product. Would you be willing to consider $1,600,000? This feels like a fair compromise considering the value it offers.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for explaining your position. I understand you have other potential buyers, but so do I. I can go up to $1,100,000, but that's my absolute limit. Let me know if that works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you've been a great potential buyer and I respect that you're sticking to your budget. I've tried to be flexible, but I also have to consider my bottom line. Given everything we've discussed,  I'm willing to accept $1,300,000.  This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to move forward with other buyers. ",1300000.0,Alice,7,
