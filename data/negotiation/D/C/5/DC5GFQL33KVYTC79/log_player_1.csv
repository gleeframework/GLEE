Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. It also reflects the fact that the product is worth at least $12,000 to me. If Bob rejects the offer, I can then consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counter-offer.  I'll be prepared to negotiate, but ultimately I'm willing to walk away and sell to John for $12,000 if I can't get a price I'm happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I can still make a counter-offer that might get me closer to my initial goal of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise that is still above what I'd get from John, but also shows a willingness to negotiate.  I think it's a reasonable offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $13,500.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, this is still a good deal.  It's significantly better than selling to John, and I'm not sure how much more I can realistically negotiate with Bob at this point."
