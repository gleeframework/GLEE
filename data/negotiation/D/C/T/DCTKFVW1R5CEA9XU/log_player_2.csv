"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is far above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lowball offer of $10,000, which is my maximum budget.  This establishes my limits and gives Alice a clear idea of what I'm willing to pay. It's also a significant decrease from her initial offer, which might make her more likely to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $18,000 represents the value I place on this product, I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet halfway at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, $14,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $11,000, showing that I'm willing to compromise while staying within my budget. This is a reasonable increase from my previous offer, making it more likely Alice will consider it.  I'm also highlighting that I'm still open to finding a solution that works for both of us."
