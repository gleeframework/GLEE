"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This sets a strong initial benchmark and allows for potential negotiation down the line. I'm aiming to maximize profit, but I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $800,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a better deal in the next round.  I have several rounds left, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not giving away too much. I'm hoping to find a compromise closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is close to John's offer, I'm still hopeful that I can get a slightly better price from Bob. I have several rounds left, and I don't want to settle for less than I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my previous offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice him to close the deal, as we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a significant improvement over John's offer, and we're running out of rounds. I'm confident that I can find another buyer if this deal falls through, but I'd rather secure a sale now and avoid the risk of losing both buyers."
