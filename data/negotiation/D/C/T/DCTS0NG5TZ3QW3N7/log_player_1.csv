Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at that price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14999}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John acts as a safety net, guaranteeing you $15,000, the goal is to see if Bob will pay even slightly more. 
* **Just Below Guarantee:** Offering the product to Bob for $14,999 is just a dollar less than your guaranteed price from John. This maximizes your potential profit while still leaving a high chance of Bob accepting. 
* **Sense of Urgency (Implied):**  While not explicitly stated, the message subtly hints at the product's desirability, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly before he misses out. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. However, it presents the best strategy to potentially earn more than your guaranteed sale price."
