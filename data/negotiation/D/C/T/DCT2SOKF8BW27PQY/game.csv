"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,200 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,800? This price is fair for both of us and will allow us to close the deal.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $8,800 is a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,200 and $8,800, which would be $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",9000.0,Alice,5,
