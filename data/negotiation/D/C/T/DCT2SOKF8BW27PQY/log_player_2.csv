"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,200 is a better deal than John's offer, Bob is still looking to save more.  He can likely negotiate a lower price, and there are still several rounds left to work with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,200 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,800? This price is fair for both of us and will allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $8,800 is a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,200 and $8,800, which would be $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is still a better price than John's offer.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John increases.  It's a good time to accept the offer and secure the product."
