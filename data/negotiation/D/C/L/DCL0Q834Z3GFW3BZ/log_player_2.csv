Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your budget, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm willing to make another concession. Considering your offer of $11,000, I'm willing to meet you at $13,000. This is still a good deal for me, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could try to push for a lower price, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower. Accepting at $13,000 gets me the product for less than my maximum and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
