"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900,000 is a bit low for my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your commitment to purchasing the product, Bob. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one final concession at $1,075,000. I think this is the best compromise we can reach at this point.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
