"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best possible deal. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the best possible deal. Knowing Alice values the product at $12,000, offering $12,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. This gives Alice a small profit, while still allowing Bob to save a significant amount compared to Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's desired price.  While it's closer to Bob's initial offer, Bob should continue negotiating. There is still room for a better deal, and Bob can potentially secure a lower price in future rounds.  Buying from John is still an option, but it's not the most cost-effective choice at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is a compromise that still allows Bob to save money, while showing Alice that he is serious about purchasing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. While it's tempting to accept given the limited rounds, Bob's goal is to save as much as possible. He can potentially secure a lower price by continuing to negotiate, considering he's already managed to bring the price down slightly. Buying from John is still an option, but it's still more expensive than the potential outcome of continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, aiming to meet Alice halfway. Offering $13,500 demonstrates Bob's commitment to purchasing the product while still leaving room for a potential compromise. With limited rounds remaining, this offer represents a good balance between securing a reasonable price and reaching a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer in round 7 has gone above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, the limited rounds remaining make it unlikely Bob can secure a lower price. Additionally, John is offering the product for $15,000, which is still within Bob's budget and a better deal than Alice's current offer. It's more efficient and time-saving for Bob to purchase the product from John at this point."
