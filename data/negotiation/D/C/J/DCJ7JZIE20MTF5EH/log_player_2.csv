Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $82. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth a bit more than $76.

It's time to cut bait.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $82, and you have a guaranteed option at $80."
