"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, that price point doesn't reflect the true value of the product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",925000.0,Bob,4,
