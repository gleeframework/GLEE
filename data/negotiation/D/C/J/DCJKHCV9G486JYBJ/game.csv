"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned, and it's within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer or if you'd like to counteroffer again.",10800.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $10,800 is unfortunately below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,200 to meet you halfway.  This still allows me to get a decent return on my investment and allows you to secure a valuable product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $10,900 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer or if you'd like to counteroffer again.",10900.0,Bob,4,
