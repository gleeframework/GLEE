"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit high. How about we start the negotiations at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you moving closer to my price range, Alice.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about acquiring the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is the highest I'm comfortable going. If you're unable to meet that, I understand, but I may have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already given you a significant discount from the original price. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
