"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit too high for me, but I am very interested in the product. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $9,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,500. This is the best I can do for now. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,500 is closer, but still a bit above my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised a bit by offering $11,500. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
