"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,400,000 is certainly tempting, I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price.  Would you consider $1,650,000? This allows us both to move closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,550,000. That's the highest I'm willing to pay for this product.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
