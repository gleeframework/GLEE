"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price of $12,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his maximum budget. Bob can still try to negotiate further, as there's still room for Alice to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 9000}
