I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you be interested in making an offer?,150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for showing me the product, Alice.  I'm interested but $150 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, but $60 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $110 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $70? That feels like a fair compromise.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not getting any younger, and I'd like to make a sale today. I'm willing to meet you at $90, but that's as low as I'm willing to go",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on the price, Alice.  While $90 is tempting, I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $75? It's a bit closer to what I had in mind.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not going to go any lower than $90, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll give you a free accessory worth $20 if you meet me at $90",90.0,Alice,7,
