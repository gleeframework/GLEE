Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're firm on the price, Alice.  While $90 is tempting, I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $75? It's a bit closer to what I had in mind."",

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not going to go any lower than $90, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll give you a free accessory worth $20 if you meet me at $90 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems firm on $90 and while the accessory is nice, it's not worth going over your $80 budget. You know you have a guaranteed option with John at $80, so it's better to take that deal than risk Alice not budging further."
