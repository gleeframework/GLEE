"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find very valuable.  Given its unique features, I'm initially pricing it at $13,500.  I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?  I think that's a fair price considering the value I'm placing on this product.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While $11,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,250?  I believe this represents a fair compromise for both of us.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $12,250 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $11,800? That's my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of this product.",11800.0,Alice,5,
