Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice â€“ this is her ""fallback"" price from John.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Range:** There's a potential negotiation range between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Alice's Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim for the highest price Bob is willing to pay. Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, Alice has some room to go higher. 

Here's the offer:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Why This Strategy Works**

* **Leaving Money on the Table:** Offering it for $1,200,000 would be a missed opportunity for Alice.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $1,350,000, Alice sets a higher reference point. Even if Bob negotiates down, it's more likely to stay above $1,200,000.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (""unique value proposition,"" ""potential benefits"") makes the price seem more reasonable.

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiation style or other factors that might influence his decision."
