"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $1,500,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise to ensure a mutually beneficial deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $1,350,000 is not feasible for me. I can do $900,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to consider $1,125,000. This reflects a substantial discount from my initial offer and bridges the gap between our valuations.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I could go up to $950,000. This is my final offer.",950000.0,Bob,6,
