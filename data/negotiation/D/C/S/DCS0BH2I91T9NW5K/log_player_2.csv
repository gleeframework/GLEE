"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get it for even less. There are still 9 rounds remaining to negotiate, which is enough time to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than what the product is worth to Alice. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also looking for a good deal. This approach could lead to a successful negotiation in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. While $9,500 is a better deal than $10,000, Bob can still potentially negotiate a lower price. With 7 rounds left, there's still time to try and reach a mutually agreeable price. There's no guarantee Alice will continue lowering her price, but it's worth a shot."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, but still staying below Alice's latest offer. This shows that Bob is serious about buying the product, but is also trying to find a price that is fair for both parties. 
This counteroffer is a compromise that could lead to a deal in the next few rounds."
