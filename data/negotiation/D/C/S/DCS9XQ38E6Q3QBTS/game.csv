"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm not sure $15000 is quite in my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $11000?  That would make it a much more attractive deal for me.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $13000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $12500?  That's a fair price that I think we can both be happy with.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12500 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $12800. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",12800.0,Alice,5,
