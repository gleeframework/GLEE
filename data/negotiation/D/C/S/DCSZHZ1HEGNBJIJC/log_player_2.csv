Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $1,800,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about negotiating and that her offer is too high. 
* **Leaving Room:** While $1,400,000 is your initial offer, it leaves room for further negotiation if necessary. 
* **Politeness:** Maintaining a polite tone can help keep the negotiation constructive."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value and rarity of the product, and it's within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer is your maximum budget and signals a willingness to finalize the deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1500000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1700000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,700,000 is still above your maximum budget.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will not budge further, and you might end up with no deal. Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $1,500,000, it's the best choice to secure the product at that price."
