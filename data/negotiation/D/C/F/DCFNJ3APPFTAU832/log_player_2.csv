It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $1,100,000."

You're still closer to your goal of $1,000,000. Keep negotiating with Alice to see if you can get her down further."

# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.

You're now just $75,000 away from your goal of $1,000,000, but Alice is unlikely to go lower. It's not worth risking further negotiation, especially since John is offering a guaranteed price that meets your budget."
