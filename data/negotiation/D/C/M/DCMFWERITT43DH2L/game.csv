"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $1050000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1100000 is still a little too high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution. My final offer is $1075000. This price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's close this deal!",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go below $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $1087500. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
