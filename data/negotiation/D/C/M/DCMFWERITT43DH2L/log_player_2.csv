# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $1050000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his budget. Bob wants to save as much as possible and is willing to risk the negotiation continuing.  He can likely secure a better price by continuing to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution. My final offer is $1,075,000. This price reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go below $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $1087500. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has reached a point where Alice's offer is very close to his budget. At $1,087,500, he's only paying $87,500 more than he would from John. It's not a huge difference, and there's a chance if he rejects this offer, Alice might not come down further. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a price that's still favorable to him.  It's a good compromise."
