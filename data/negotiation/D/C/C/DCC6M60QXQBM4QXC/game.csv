"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to $1000000 to make this worthwhile. How about $950000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $950000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $925000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get the price down a bit more. I'm offering $900000, and I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy with the deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
