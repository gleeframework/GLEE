# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you and the fact that I'm still making a significant profit. What do you think?

While $11,000 is better than $12,000, it's still above my desired price point. I can likely get a better deal by continuing negotiations or buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 might be a bit high, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the fact that I'm still making a decent profit. What do you think?

While $10,800 is closer to my desired price, it's still above my maximum budget.  John is offering the product for $10,000, which is a better deal.  I'll buy from John."
