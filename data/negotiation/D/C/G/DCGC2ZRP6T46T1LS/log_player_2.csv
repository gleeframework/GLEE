"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to make you an offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I think it's a fair deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price.  $900,000 is too high, but it's a good starting point for the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This price is still a good value for you considering your cost, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $875,000 is closer to your target, it's still a bit high. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, hoping to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $875,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $860,000?  This is a fair price that gives you a good profit while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $860,000 is still a bit below your target price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer the product to you for $870,000. This is a fair price that still gives me a good profit, and I think it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's a good idea to accept Alice's offer.  You're close to your target price of $800,000 and continuing to negotiate could risk her getting frustrated and walking away from the deal.  You're getting a good value for the product, and it's better to secure it now than risk losing it by pushing too hard."
