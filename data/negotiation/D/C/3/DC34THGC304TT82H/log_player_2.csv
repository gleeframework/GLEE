Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $800,000.

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You've negotiated the price down to $815,000, saving $385,000 from Alice's initial offer and $385,000 compared to John's price. 
* **Alice's Firm Stance:** Alice has stated twice that this is her lowest price.  Continuing to negotiate might frustrate her and risk her walking away from the deal.
* **Limited Rounds:** You only have a few rounds left, and there's no guarantee you'll get a better price from Alice. 

While you could try to negotiate further, accepting the $815,000 offer secures a very good deal."
