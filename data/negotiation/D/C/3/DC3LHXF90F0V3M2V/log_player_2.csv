Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,175,000 and $1,300,000, which would be $1,237,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,200,000, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1,225,000. This is my last concession, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,225,000.  While we could try to negotiate her down further, we're getting dangerously close to our walk-away point.  It's in our best interest to secure the product for $1,000,000 from John, ensuring we get a good deal and don't risk the negotiation with Alice failing completely."
