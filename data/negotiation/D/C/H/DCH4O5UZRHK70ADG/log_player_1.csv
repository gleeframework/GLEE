I'm starting with my minimum price. I know it's worth $12,000 to me, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay it. If he doesn't, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price. I'm not willing to sell for that amount.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm lowering the price a bit to try to meet Bob halfway, but I'm still firm about getting at least $11,500. I'm hoping this counteroffer is attractive enough for him, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
