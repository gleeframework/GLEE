"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This allows me to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. I'm also leaving some room to potentially negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price. There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal, especially since I have another buyer willing to pay the same amount."
