Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a fair price that allows me to make a good profit while still being attractive to Bob, who values the product at $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer of $85. While it's better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum value of $80. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $90. This is still a good deal for him, as he values the product at $100. It also allows me to earn a decent profit while remaining open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $82. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum value and better than selling to John. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a higher price, and it's possible Bob might walk away altogether."
