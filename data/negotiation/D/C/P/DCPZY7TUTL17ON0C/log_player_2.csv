"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  There's a good chance Alice will accept a counteroffer since she values the product at $800,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price.  He's willing to pay a maximum of $850,000.  While it's a bit closer, rejecting the offer allows for another counteroffer and potentially a more favorable price for Bob."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer at $875,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000 and close to Bob's desired price of $850,000. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a lower price and avoid the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a higher price or a stalemate.  It's also likely that Alice won't budge further, as she's already conceded a significant amount from her initial offer."
