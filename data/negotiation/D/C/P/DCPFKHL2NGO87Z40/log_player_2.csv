"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the potential for you to make a significant profit.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This leaves room for me to come up if needed. 
* **Strategic Number:** $1,050,000 is 70% of Alice's initial asking price. It signals that I'm serious about buying but want a substantial discount. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message is polite and expresses continued interest, leaving the door open for further negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This would still allow you to make a decent profit, and it's closer to what I need to make on this sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is tempting, I'm so close to John's price that it's worth one more counter-offer to try and get a better deal. Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, so I think there's still room to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $1,150,000.  Would you be open to $1,125,000?"", ""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Below John's Price:** My goal is to get the product for less than John's $1,200,000 offer. By aiming for under $1,150,000, I'm trying to secure a significant saving.
* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer by a decent amount ($75,000) to show Alice I'm serious about reaching a deal. 
* **Maintaining Respect:** I continue to be appreciative of Alice's time and willingness to negotiate, hoping to keep the conversation positive. 
* **Time Consideration:**  I'm aware that each round takes time. This offer balances getting a good deal with potentially closing the deal quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,187,500. This is a fair compromise and would allow you to make a substantial profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,187,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,187,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly coming down in price, and her latest offer of $1,187,500 is still more expensive than John's $1,200,000. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and at this point, the potential savings from further negotiation aren't worth the risk of her walking away or the additional time spent.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the product from John at a guaranteed price."
