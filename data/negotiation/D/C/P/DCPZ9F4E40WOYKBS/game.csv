"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer that I think is fair and reasonable. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm and recognize the product's potential, I'm looking to make a more significant investment. To make this work for me, I'd need to bring the price down to $700,000. This would give us both a solid profit margin and allows me to move forward confidently. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to make a significant investment, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still allows us both to make a profit. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
