"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer that I think is fair and reasonable. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is well above her minimum value, and there's significant room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to start a counteroffer process, potentially securing a much better price. Buying from John for $1,500,000 is a less attractive option, as you can potentially get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm and recognize the product's potential, I'm looking to make a more significant investment. To make this work for me, I'd need to bring the price down to $700,000. This would give us both a solid profit margin and allows me to move forward confidently. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to make a significant investment, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still allows us both to make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point. While $850,000 is still more than your initial counteroffer, it represents a significant saving compared to buying from John for $1,500,000.  Furthermore, continued negotiation could potentially lead to Alice rejecting your future counteroffers, forcing you to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product for a good price, minimizing your risk."
