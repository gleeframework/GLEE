"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I've done some research and understand that it's worth $1,000,000 to you. However, considering its true value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
