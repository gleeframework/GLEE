Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a good deal, as it's less than what he values the product at. It also leaves room for negotiation if he wants to counteroffer. However, it still allows me to make a profit well above my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I will reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great price considering what the product is worth to you. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but I really think that's as high as I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is still below my minimum price of $12,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John.  Selling to John for $12,000 ensures I meet my minimum price and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
