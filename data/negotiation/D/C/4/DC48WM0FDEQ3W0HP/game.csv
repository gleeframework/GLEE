"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great price considering what the product is worth to you. Let's meet in the middle!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but I really think that's as high as I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",11500.0,Bob,4,
