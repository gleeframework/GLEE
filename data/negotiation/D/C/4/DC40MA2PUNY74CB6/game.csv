"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,350,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. I'm happy to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows us to reach a mutually agreeable deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
