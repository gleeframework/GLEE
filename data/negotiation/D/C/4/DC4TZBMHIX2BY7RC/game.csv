"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $11,500 is a good starting point, I'm looking for something closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still looking for a price closer to $12,500.  Let's split the difference at $12,150. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?",12150.0,Alice,5,
