Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $115 is more than your minimum price of $100, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is lower than Bob's perceived value of $120, giving him an incentive to accept.
* **It's aggressive:**  It sets a high starting point, potentially allowing for a higher final sale price.

If Bob rejects the offer, you can then assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer yourself. Keep in mind that John is a backup buyer, offering a guaranteed $100, so you have a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is your minimum, it's important to consider the negotiation dynamic. Bob's offer is significantly lower than your initial price of $115, indicating he's trying to get a good deal. Accepting his offer would be a loss for you, as you could potentially achieve a higher price.

Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to your desired price.  You can then use John as a safety net if negotiations with Bob ultimately fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering the price to $110. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit, but it also shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate. It is important to keep in mind that my backup offer from John is still a viable option, so I can afford to be slightly flexible with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is still at $100, demonstrating his unwillingness to budge. At this point, continuing negotiations with Bob would likely be futile and time-consuming. Selling to John for $100 guarantees me a profit and avoids any further negotiation headaches. It's a strategic decision to secure the guaranteed income rather than risk losing more time and potential profit with Bob."
