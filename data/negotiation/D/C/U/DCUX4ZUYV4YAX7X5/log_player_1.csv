Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I believe $1,500,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the counter-offer.  $1,350,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $1,125,000?  I feel that's a fair compromise.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is very close to where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and close at $1,225,000?
