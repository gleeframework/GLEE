"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $850000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $780000 for the product, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",780000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $820000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",820000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $820000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $800000, which is my absolute limit.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while ensuring you still make a profit.  Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
