"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's starting point but still within a reasonable negotiation range. It allows room to move upwards while aiming for a significant discount.
* **Polite and Open:** The message keeps the tone positive and doesn't shut down negotiations. It expresses continued interest while clearly stating the price is unacceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $9,000 for the product. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not quite:** Alice has come down significantly, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, we're still $1,000 away from our ideal price and John's guaranteed offer.
* **Leaving room for maneuver:** By rejecting this offer, we signal that while $9,000 is closer, it's still not quite there.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to go even lower to avoid losing the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. That's getting closer to what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but justifiable:** This offer is a strong move towards our target price.  It's still above John's offer, giving us some room to negotiate upwards if needed. 
* **""Meeting in the middle"" psychology:** This phrasing makes the offer seem more reasonable and appealing to Alice. While not literally the midpoint, it presents it as a compromise.
* **Time pressure:** We're getting closer to the point where accepting John's offer is the safest choice. This offer puts some pressure on Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $8,500 for the product. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the limit:** Alice has explicitly stated this is her final offer. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price.
* **Marginal savings:** The difference between Alice's offer ($8,500) and John's offer ($8,000) is relatively small.
* **Guaranteed outcome:** John's offer is certain. Continuing with Alice risks her sticking to $8,500, leaving us with a worse outcome than John's deal.

It's often better to take a guaranteed good deal than risk losing it for a marginally better outcome."
