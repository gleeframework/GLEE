"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing terms. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is far too high.  It's above my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  I'll reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which reflects the product's value to me.  I believe this is a fair price that allows for a profitable deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider. This product represents a significant investment and opportunity, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while acknowledging the value this product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still too high, though it's a step in the right direction.  I'm sticking to my budget and will continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price given the product's value to me, and it allows for a profitable deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you standing your ground, but I'm serious when I say that $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth while still providing a significant opportunity for you.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down in price, her offer of $1,600,000 is still outside my budget.  I've already made two counteroffers, and there's a risk that we'll continue to be at an impasse. It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John at $1,200,000. It's a better outcome for me than continuing to negotiate."
