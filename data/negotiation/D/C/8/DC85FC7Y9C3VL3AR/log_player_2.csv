"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $18,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far above his maximum budget of $12,000. He should try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $15,500. It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.

While $15,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point of $12,000.  He should continue negotiating with Alice to try and bring the price down further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $14,000. It's a bit higher than your latest offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.

Bob has reached his limit.  While $14,000 is closer to his budget, it's still not ideal. Since he has a guaranteed option to buy from John for $12,000, he should choose that route to ensure he gets the product at his preferred price.  Further negotiation with Alice could potentially bring the price down, but there's no guarantee, and the risk of continuing is not worth the potential savings."
