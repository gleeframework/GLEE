"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $18,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you is $15,000. Let's meet in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $15,500. It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which would give you a good profit and still stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $14,000. It's a bit higher than your latest offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",14000.0,Alice,5,
