"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, however, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $13,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What are your thoughts?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $13,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,500? I feel that's a fair offer considering the current market value.",9500.0,Bob,4,
