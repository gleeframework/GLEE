Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I know the product is worth $800,000 to both of us, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a maximized profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value might even exceed Bob's initial assessment, potentially justifying the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains collaborative and open to Bob's counter-offer, avoiding a hardline approach that might scare him off. 

**Worst Case:** Bob rejects the offer, and I sell to John for the guaranteed $800,000.

**Best Case:**  Bob accepts the offer, or we negotiate down to a price significantly higher than my minimum."
