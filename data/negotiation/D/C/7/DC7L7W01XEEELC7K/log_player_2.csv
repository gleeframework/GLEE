"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially do better. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's definitely tempting, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible while still getting the product.  Alice's offer of $11,500 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and still saves Bob $3,500 compared to buying from John.  There's a risk of further negotiation, but the potential savings are small compared to the current offer, making it a reasonable decision to accept."
