"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a fair profit for you.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $750000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and your interest in it.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $950000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $825000 for the product. This price is closer to my target and allows for a fair profit for you while remaining within my financial limits.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $825000. I'm willing to meet you at $925000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value and your interest in it.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $925000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $875000 for the product. This price represents a significant savings for me and allows for a fair profit for you.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $875000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to make one final concession and meet you at $920000. This is my best and final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",920000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence in reaching an agreement. However, $920000 is still above my target. I'm willing to offer $890000 for the product.
