"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $18,000 is already a very competitive price for this product and its value. I could meet you halfway at $15,000, which is a fair deal for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $15,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is a significant step from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",13500.0,Bob,4,
