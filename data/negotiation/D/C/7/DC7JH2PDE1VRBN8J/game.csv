"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to both of us, but I am hoping we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1100000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both parties.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further and offer the product for $1250000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your offer, but I am still looking to keep the cost below $1200000 if possible. Would it be feasible to consider $1150000 as a compromise between our positions?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay under $1200000. I'm willing to go down to $1175000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
