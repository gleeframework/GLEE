This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Price is right:**  You've negotiated a $200,000 discount from Alice's original asking price. 
* **""Final offer"":** Alice has indicated this is her final offer, meaning pushing further could risk losing the deal.
* **Time is ticking:** You're over halfway through your negotiation rounds. While you could potentially get the price lower, there's no guarantee, and you risk Alice becoming less willing to negotiate.

While buying from John is an option, accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a significant saving."
