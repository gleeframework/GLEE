,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135?  This still gives you a great deal on the product.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $132 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference at $133.  It's a fair price for both of us.",133.0,Alice,5,
