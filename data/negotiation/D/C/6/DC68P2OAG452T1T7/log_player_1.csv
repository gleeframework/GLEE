Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product that I know you'll love. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $95. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product for $95 gives Bob a small discount while allowing you to maximize your profit. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $80 to John, so you don't need to go below that price."
