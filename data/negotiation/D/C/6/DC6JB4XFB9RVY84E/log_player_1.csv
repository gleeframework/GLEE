Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its potential value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I'm motivated to sell, $850,000 undervalues the product significantly. To move this forward, I could consider $1,150,000. This reflects a more accurate valuation. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. However, $1,150,000 remains beyond my comfortable range.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is increasing his offer, he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  It's unlikely he'll reach $1,000,000 in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
