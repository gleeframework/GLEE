"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its potential value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I'm motivated to sell, $850,000 undervalues the product significantly. To move this forward, I could consider $1,150,000. This reflects a more accurate valuation. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's budget, $1,150,000 is still too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate further before considering John's offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. However, $1,150,000 remains beyond my comfortable range.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
