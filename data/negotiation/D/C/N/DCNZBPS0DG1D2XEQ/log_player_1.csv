Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this [product name] and I'm looking for $150 for it. It's in excellent condition and I'm sure you'll love it! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $150, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive messaging:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to buy and emphasize the product's value.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending the message with a question to open the door for Bob to counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while also keeping the negotiation open and friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Counteroffering is a better strategy:**  Instead of accepting a low offer or selling to John for $100, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120. This is still a great deal for a [product name] in excellent condition. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffering with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price to $120. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable price point. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reiterating the product's good condition to remind Bob of its worth and justify the price.
* **Keeping the negotiation open:**  I'm asking for Bob's opinion to encourage further discussion and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer of $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100. While it's not ideal, it's a good compromise.
* **Selling to John is not profitable:** Selling to John for $100 would be a better outcome, but it's risky to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially lose out on a sale altogether.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing the negotiation might lead to a higher price, but it's unclear how much time and effort it will take to achieve that. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and relatively profitable sale.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic decision, balancing profit and the risk of a prolonged negotiation."
