Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product for a price of $950,000.  I believe this represents excellent value given its potential worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a price of $950,000, which is a good starting point. It's significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, emphasizing the value the product offers Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for Bob to negotiate down, but I'm confident that I can get at least $800,000 from John if necessary. 

This strategy allows for flexibility and potential for a good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I am not able to meet the price of $950,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is higher than John's offer of $800,000, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a bit higher in the next round of negotiations.  There's a good chance he'll be willing to pay more to secure the product rather than risk losing it altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While it's closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Let's split the difference.  I'm happy to accept $900,000 for the product.  This would ensure a fair deal for both of us.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering with $900,000, which is the midpoint between my initial offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still holding out for a better price.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and positive, emphasizing fairness and a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a clear reason for my counteroffer,  highlighting that it's a good deal for both parties.

I believe this counteroffer is fair and increases the likelihood that Bob will accept, while still achieving a price higher than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've carefully considered your latest proposal, but unfortunately, I'm unable to agree to a price of $900,000. I would like to counter with an offer of $875,000. I hope this figure will be more acceptable to you while still allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000, which ensures I achieve my minimum goal.  At this point, there's a risk of further negotiation driving the price down, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting Bob's offer is the best way to secure a profitable sale."
