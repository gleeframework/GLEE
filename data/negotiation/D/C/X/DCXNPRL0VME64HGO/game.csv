"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I am not able to meet the price of $950,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While it's closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Let's split the difference.  I'm happy to accept $900,000 for the product.  This would ensure a fair deal for both of us.  What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I've carefully considered your latest proposal, but unfortunately, I'm unable to agree to a price of $900,000. I would like to counter with an offer of $875,000. I hope this figure will be more acceptable to you while still allowing me to stay within my budget.",875000.0,Bob,4,
