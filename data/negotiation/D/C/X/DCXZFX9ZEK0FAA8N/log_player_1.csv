Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and this is a competitive price for its value."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher price allows for potential negotiation and maximizes the possibility of a higher profit margin. Even if Bob negotiates down, there's a chance to secure a price higher than John's offer. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer gives Bob the impression there's room for negotiation, making him more likely to engage in the conversation rather than a flat rejection.
* **Confident Approach:** Presenting a confident front with a well-justified price can sometimes lead buyers to perceive more value in the product.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves a certain level of risk. If Bob is unwilling to negotiate and immediately rejects the offer, the guaranteed $15,000 from John is forfeited."
