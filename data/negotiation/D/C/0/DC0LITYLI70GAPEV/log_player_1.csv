I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting, it's significantly lower than what I consider the product's value.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $10,000 is a bit too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 17000}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. It's getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm going to counter again and see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500. It's a fair compromise, and it's the lowest I can go right now.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15500}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time, and while Bob is getting closer, his offers are still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to sell to John for $15,000.  It's a guaranteed sale and ensures I get at least my minimum threshold."
