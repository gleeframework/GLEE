Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000:** This is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) but still leaves room for potential compromise. 
* **Rationale:**  I am aiming to maximize profit, and by starting high, I give myself the best chance of securing a higher price. If Bob rejects, I still have John's guaranteed offer, so I have nothing to lose by trying for a better deal. 

**Important Note:**  This is just a starting point.  Further negotiation might be necessary depending on Bob's reaction. I'll need to assess his interest and adjust my offer accordingly."
