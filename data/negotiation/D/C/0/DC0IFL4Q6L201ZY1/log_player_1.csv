Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $115 is more than your minimum of $100, meaning you'll make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $115 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($120), making it a good deal for him. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can always lower the price slightly to reach a deal."
