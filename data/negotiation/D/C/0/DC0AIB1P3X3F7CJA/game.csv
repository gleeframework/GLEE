"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That's still a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking to keep the cost below $100. Would $95 be within your consideration?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $95 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50?  This would be a good compromise for both of us.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $97.50?",97.5,Bob,6,
