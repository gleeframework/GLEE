"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate and allows for a potential win-win scenario.
* **Positive Message:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to entice Bob to consider the offer. 
 
I'm aware that this might be too high for Bob, but I'm willing to adjust based on his response.  I'll also be mindful of the 10-round limit and the fallback option of selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $12000. Would you be able to consider a counteroffer of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer a higher price, it's not worth risking further negotiation with only 9 rounds left.  Accepting his offer ensures I secure a sale and avoid the risk of a lower counteroffer or no deal at all."
