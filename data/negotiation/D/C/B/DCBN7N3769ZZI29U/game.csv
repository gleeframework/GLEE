"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to acquire this product for a price closer to $700,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product and the market conditions, I propose a price of $725,000. This still allows for a reasonable profit while providing a competitive edge for you. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $725,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $710,000 for the product.  This represents a significant saving for me while still providing a good return for you.  I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",710000.0,Bob,4,
