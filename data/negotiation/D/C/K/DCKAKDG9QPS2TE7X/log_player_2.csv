{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $12,000, which is still higher than Bob's ideal price.
* **Buying from John:**  While a fallback option, it's the most expensive.
* **Negotiating:**  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a better price through counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's value:** $10,000.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** Start with a lower price, but not too low to seem unreasonable. This gives room for negotiation and shows Bob is serious about buying. 
* **Potential for success:**  Alice might be willing to negotiate down from her initial price to secure a deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $13,000, which is still higher than Bob's ideal price but closer. 
* **Buying from John:** Still the most expensive option.
* **Negotiating:**  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to continue trying to get a lower price, even if the negotiation might be getting harder."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's value:** $10,000.
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  Increase the offer slightly, but still within Bob's budget.  This shows a willingness to compromise without immediately jumping to John's price.
* **Potential for success:**  Alice may be getting closer to accepting a deal, and this offer might bridge the gap."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $14,000, getting closer to John's price.
* **Buying from John:**  Still the most expensive option, but starting to look more attractive as Alice's offers increase.
* **Negotiating:**  There are still rounds left.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a lower price, but the time is running out. 

**Important Note:**  This is a risky move. Bob is pushing his luck.  If Alice refuses to budge, he may be forced to buy from John, losing out on significant savings."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible, but time is running out.
* **Alice's value:** $10,000.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** This is a significant increase from the previous offer, showing Bob's willingness to meet Alice halfway. It's still within Bob's budget but also tests Alice's commitment.
* **Potential for success:** Alice might be getting frustrated and be more willing to accept a price closer to Bob's preferred range. However, there is a risk that Alice might reject this offer and force Bob to buy from John.

**Important Note:** This is a risky move. Bob needs to carefully assess Alice's behavior and decide whether this is a good gamble or if it's time to switch to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible, but also complete the purchase.
* **Alice's offer:** $14,500, which is close to John's price and likely getting closer to Alice's desired price.
* **Buying from John:**  Still the most expensive option, but now the risk of Alice continuing to increase the price is high.
* **Negotiating:** There are only three rounds left, and Alice is clearly not going to budge significantly.

**Important Note:**  It's time for Bob to cut his losses.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks losing more time and money, potentially leading to a worse outcome than buying from John. It's better to secure the product now, even at a slightly higher price, and avoid further delays."
