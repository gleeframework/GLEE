Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,125,000. This product is worth a lot to me, and I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,125,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  There is a chance that Alice might lower the price further, but there's also a chance that she won't.  Given the uncertainty, it's safer to purchase the product from John for my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  This ensures I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Alice that might not lead to a successful outcome."
