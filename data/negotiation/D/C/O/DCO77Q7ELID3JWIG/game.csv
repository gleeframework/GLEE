"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500.  This is a great price for a product that will be worth it to you in the long run.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still committed to getting a fair price for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  That's a good price for both of us, and will ensure you get a product that you'll be happy with for years to come.",10000.0,Alice,5,
