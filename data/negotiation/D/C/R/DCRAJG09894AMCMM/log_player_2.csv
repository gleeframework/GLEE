Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really close to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $7,125, but I'd like to get a bit more. How about we add a small premium for the value this product will bring to you? I can offer it to you for $7,300.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to push the price up a bit, but this offer is still a significant savings compared to John's price of $8,000.  Continuing to negotiate might backfire, risking Alice increasing the price or reaching an impasse."
