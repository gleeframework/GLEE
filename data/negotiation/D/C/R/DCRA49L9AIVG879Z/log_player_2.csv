Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about making a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  We're in the final rounds, she's unlikely to go lower, and $900,000 is a reasonable price considering our $1,200,000 limit and the fact that John won't budge."
