Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,900,000 is significantly over my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, given its value to me.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects our respective interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This offer reflects a considerable amount of effort on my part to meet a compromise. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

At $1,450,000, Bob's offer is now exceeding my minimum acceptable price and it's close to John's standing offer. It's best to accept and avoid the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiations breaking down."
