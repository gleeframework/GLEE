"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's important to establish a strong starting point. It's unlikely Bob will accept this right away, but it will give me a good gauge of his interest and help me determine a more realistic price for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to sell for that price just yet, and I believe I have room to negotiate. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,750,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum.  I believe this is a reasonable price that might be appealing to Bob, and we can hopefully find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
