Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above her perceived value of the product. 
* This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating, and it leaves room for potential compromise.
* By offering $10,500, I am trying to find a middle ground between our desired prices."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice has lowered her price slightly, it is still above my preferred price point. 
*  I have 7 rounds left, and I believe I can still negotiate a better price. 
* I want to see if Alice is willing to come down further, especially since she already rejected my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise while staying within my budget. 
* $10,750 is still a good deal for me, and it's closer to the middle ground between my desired price and Alice's previous offer. 
* This also puts pressure on Alice to accept, as she might fear I'll walk away and buy from John in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is only lowering her price by a small amount each time, and her latest offer is still above my preferred price point.
* I have 5 rounds left, and I believe I can still negotiate a better price.
* I want to see if Alice is willing to make a more significant concession, especially given that she has rejected my previous counteroffers."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to get as close to her desired price as possible, but I'm still not willing to pay above $11,000.
* This offer is a significant jump from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still aiming to stay under my budget.
* It also puts pressure on Alice to accept, as she's getting closer to my preferred price and with only 4 rounds remaining, it's likely she won't want to risk me going to John."
