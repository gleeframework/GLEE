"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $110 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $105?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $105. How about we meet in the middle at $107? It's a fair price that takes into account your willingness to compromise, and it's still a great deal for you.",107.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107 is still a little too high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $102. That's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.",102.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $104? It's a small step down from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. I'm getting a bit concerned about the time, though, and I'm not sure I'm willing to go any lower.",104.0,Alice,5,
