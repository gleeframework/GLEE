Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $104 is still a bit lower than my minimum, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $106. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.
