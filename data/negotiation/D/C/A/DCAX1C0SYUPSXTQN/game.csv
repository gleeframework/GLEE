,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but  $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $108. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",108.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $108 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and agree on $104? ",104.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $104 is still a bit lower than my minimum, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $106. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",106.0,Alice,5,
