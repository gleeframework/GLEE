Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $110. I believe it would be very valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  You know the product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $110, you're aiming to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($120 - $80 = $40) while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($120 - $110 = $10). 

This strategy balances profit maximization with a high likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
