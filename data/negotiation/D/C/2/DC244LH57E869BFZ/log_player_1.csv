Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $9,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $7,500 at this time.  Let me know what you think.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident the product is valuable, but I'm really limited to $8,000.  If you're willing to come down to that price, I'm ready to make the purchase.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.
