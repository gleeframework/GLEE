,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $75 for it right now. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $82.50? ",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $82.50 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $78 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to be fair here.  Let's just meet in the middle at $80.  That's a good price for both of us, and I'd rather sell it to you than to someone else.",80.0,Alice,5,
