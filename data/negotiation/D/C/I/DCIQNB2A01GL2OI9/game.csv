"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This is a significant investment, but I'm confident that the product's potential will far exceed this price. I'm open to discussing the details further if you're interested.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1500000 is outside my budget. I'm very interested in your product, but I can only offer $750000 at this time.  This reflects the maximum value I can see in the product, given the information I have now. If you're open to negotiating, I'm happy to discuss further.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. While $750000 is significantly below my initial asking price, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm prepared to lower the price to $1200000. This still represents a significant value for you, given the potential of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1200000 is still a bit high for me. Considering the value I currently see in the product and my available budget, I can offer $900000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement.  I'm open to discussing further if you have any concerns.",900000.0,Bob,4,
