# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a lower price. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a compromise for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $10,000. How about we try $10,500? This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make this concession to keep the negotiation going. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's unlikely to go much lower than $10,500. Accepting this offer secures a good price for you without risking the negotiation falling apart."
