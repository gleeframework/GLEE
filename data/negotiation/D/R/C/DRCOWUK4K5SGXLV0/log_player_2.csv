"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob should offer the absolute minimum he is willing to pay.  Alice knows he has a backup option with John, so this counteroffer might be enough to get her to agree. If not, there is still room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He has a backup option with John, so there's no urgency to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

Bob should increase his offer slightly to $13,000.  This shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product but still wants to save money. It's a compromise that could potentially lead to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $14,500 is getting closer to his budget, he's still within range of getting a better deal.  He can try to negotiate further with Alice, knowing he has a guaranteed backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

Bob should increase his offer to $14,000. This is a compromise that is getting closer to Alice's asking price, but it's still within his budget. This demonstrates his willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price he's comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While $14,250 is higher than his ideal price, it's still within his budget and a significant improvement from Alice's initial asking price.  It's also very close to his last counteroffer, suggesting that Alice is coming down in price.  If he rejects this offer, he risks Alice going back up on the price or the negotiation going on for longer.  Given the number of rounds left, accepting the offer seems like the best strategy to get the product within his budget."
