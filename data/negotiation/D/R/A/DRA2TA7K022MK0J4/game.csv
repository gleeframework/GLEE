"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product.  This price still offers you a healthy profit and would be a great deal for me. Let's see if we can agree on this.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8500.
