"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $15000 just yet. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $18000. This is still a great deal, considering the value it can bring to your life.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16000. I'm confident that's a fair price for this product.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that $16000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not ready to accept it. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $17500. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident it's still a great value for the product.",17500.0,Alice,5,
