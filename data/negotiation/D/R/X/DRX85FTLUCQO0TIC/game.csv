"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,100,000 doesn't fully reflect the value this product holds for you.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This represents a significant concession on my part, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,075,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,075,000 simply doesn't cover the value this product brings.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,125,000. This represents a considerable concession from my previous offer. Let's make this deal happen.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,125,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1,062,500. Can you consider this revised offer?",1062500.0,Bob,6,
