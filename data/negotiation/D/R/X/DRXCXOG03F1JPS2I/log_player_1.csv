{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you.  I'm asking for $10,000, given its value."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice needs at least $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $10,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets a $2,000 discount from his perceived value, and Alice makes a $2,000 profit over her minimum.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept."
