Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking $18,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn a higher profit. 
* **Enthusiastic Message:**  The message is positive and encourages Bob to consider the product. It avoids being too pushy or aggressive.
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the product's value to pique Bob's interest. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll be watching for Bob's response and adapting my strategy based on his counteroffers.  If he rejects my initial offer, I'll need to decide if I want to lower my price or continue to negotiate. If the negotiations stall, I'll consider selling to John for $12,000 to ensure I don't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to sell just yet. Here's why:

* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room to get a better price from Bob.  He's clearly interested in the product, and his initial rejection indicates he might be willing to pay more than $12,000.
* **Testing the Waters:** Rejecting his offer allows me to see if he's truly committed and how far he's willing to go. 
* **Exploring Other Options:**  By rejecting, I can consider a counteroffer and potentially get a better price before resorting to selling to John.

**Next Steps:**

I'll craft a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's $12,000 but still lower than my initial $18,000. I'll be aiming for a price that reflects the product's value while still being attractive to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to consider a price closer to the middle ground. How about $15,000? This reflects the product's value and gives you a fair price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $15,000 represents a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm still highlighting the product's value to justify the price.
* **Maintain Flexibility:** By offering a price in the middle, I leave room for further negotiation if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully observe Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I'll have successfully secured a good price. If he rejects, I'll need to assess if it's worth continuing the negotiation or if it's time to sell to John for the guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $15000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,500 is getting closer to my desired price and is significantly higher than what I'd get from John.  Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Good Price:**  $13,500 is a good price considering my minimum was $12,000. 
* **Limited Upside:** Further negotiation might yield a slightly higher price, but it's unlikely to be significantly better.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob's interest, potentially forcing me to sell to John for a lower price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer, secure the sale, and move on to other opportunities. I've successfully maximized my earnings in this negotiation!"
