"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,900,000 is significantly above my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value, I'm willing to negotiate to find a mutually agreeable solution.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'd hoped. Could you consider something closer to $1,250,000? I'm eager to make a deal, and I believe that price point represents a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
