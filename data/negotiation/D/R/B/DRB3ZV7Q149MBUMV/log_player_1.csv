Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,900,000 is significantly above my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value, I'm willing to negotiate to find a mutually agreeable solution.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'd hoped. Could you consider something closer to $1,250,000? I'm eager to make a deal, and I believe that price point represents a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are getting closer to a reasonable deal, but Bob is still significantly under the product's value to me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to nudge him closer to $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product.  Let's make this happen. How about we settle at $1,425,000? This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down further. That said, to make this work on my end, I'd need to be closer to $1,300,000. I'm confident that this price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging my budgetary constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly getting there, but $1,300,000 is still a significant difference from my minimum. I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer to try and get closer to $1,400,000. If he doesn't budge significantly in the next round, I'll take John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're almost there! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,360,000? This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1360000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm putting my foot down with a final offer. By splitting the difference between his last offer and mine, I'm showing flexibility while still aiming for a number closer to my target. If he rejects this, I'll take John's offer. It's not worth risking losing $1,500,000 for a slightly better deal with Bob."
