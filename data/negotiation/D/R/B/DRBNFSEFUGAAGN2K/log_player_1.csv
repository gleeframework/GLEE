Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While I start high, the message implies I'm open to discussion, allowing Bob to feel involved.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing I have John as a backup at $1,200,000 gives me leverage. Bob missing out means I still secure a good deal.

This approach balances ambition with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
