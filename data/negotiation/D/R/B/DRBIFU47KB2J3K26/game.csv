"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about I offer the product for $110? This is higher than my initial offer, but still lower than my starting point. I hope this proposal works for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too much.  I'm willing to go up to $105.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",105.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I'm glad we're making progress. Considering your latest offer, I think it's reasonable to meet somewhere between our previous positions.
