"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our premium product. This exceptional item holds significant value to us, but its true worth to you surpasses $1200000. I understand the importance of making a fair deal and ensuring that both parties are satisfied. Therefore, I am extending an offer to purchase this product at a price that reflects its immense value to you. My proposal is to sell it to you for $950000. I believe this price strikes a balance between the intrinsic value of the product and the expectations you have for it. I look forward to discussing this further and potentially closing this deal. Let's make this a win-win situation.
