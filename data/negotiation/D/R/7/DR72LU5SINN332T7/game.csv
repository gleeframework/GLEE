"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential value of the product, $900,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. This offer reflects the value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
