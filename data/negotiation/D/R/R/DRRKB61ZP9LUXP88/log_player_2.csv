Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not comfortable with $135, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $142.50. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** At this point, Alice is very unlikely to come down below John's price of $150. She's already stated that $142.50 is her lowest offer. Rather than risk her increasing the price in a future round, it's best to cut your losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $150."
