Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a quick deal. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $12,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it shows that I'm willing to compromise and hopefully get a deal with Bob before I have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to continue negotiating with him, hoping we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $10,000. I'm hoping this will be a compromise that Bob will accept.  If not, we are getting closer to the point where I might have to sell to John."
