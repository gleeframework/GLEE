"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but unfortunately,  $14,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your offer of $12,500. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being open to negotiations. $13,500 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.  What do you say?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,800. I've got a bit of wiggle room, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. What do you think?",13800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, and I'm happy to work with you. How about $13,200? This is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our target price.  If we can agree on this, we can finalize the deal right now.",13200.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to go to $13,500, but I need to make sure it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,7,
