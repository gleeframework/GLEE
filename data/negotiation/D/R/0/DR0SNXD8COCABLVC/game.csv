"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $165. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $165 is still a bit above my limit.  I'm happy to pay $155,  that's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",155.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $165 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $155. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm thinking of a price of $160. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,5,
