Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $12,000, so you're already in a good position.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $14,500 is less than what Bob values the product at, giving him an incentive to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still come down slightly if Bob makes a counteroffer, but it's not too low to start. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay $13000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is a decent amount, it's still below what I'd like to earn. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still a bit higher than $13,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,750? This price is still fair for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is a compromise:** It's halfway between your previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Shows willingness to negotiate:** This demonstrates that you're open to reaching an agreement.
* **Is still above your minimum:**  You're still making more than you would by selling to John. 

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I've reviewed our discussions, and I'm comfortable with increasing my offer to $13500. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer to $13,500. This is a good deal for me, considering I would get $12,000 if I sell to John.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to Bob."
