Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $115 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $115 is greater than your minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $120, so there is potential for a deal that benefits both of you.
* **It's a strong opening offer:**  This offer signals that you are confident in the value of your product and are not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $115 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Would you be willing to come down to $105?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and shows you're not willing to settle for his initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a great price for the value you'll get. "", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still really keen on this product, but $110 is still a little outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? It's a fair compromise and we can both get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to your minimum:** $107.50 is only $7.50 below your minimum acceptable price of $115.
* **There's a risk of losing the deal:** If you reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he might walk away, and you would only be able to sell to John for $100.
* **It's a fair compromise:** Bob has moved a little closer to your price, and you've moved a little closer to his, making it a reasonable compromise. 

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a sale that is close to your desired price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
