Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, you can always lower the price slightly and see if he's willing to meet you in the middle.  You also have the fallback option of selling to John for $10,000 if you don't reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what you consider the product to be worth.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can find a compromise closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it gives you some room for negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is getting closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can bridge the gap.  You have the option to sell to John for $10,000, but there's still a chance to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower to $10,200.  This is a fair price that's within your budget and gives me a decent return on my investment. Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? I'm willing to make a final compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a tough decision, but the negotiation seems to be at a stalemate. Bob's offer of $9,800 is still below your minimum, and while you could continue negotiating, it's not guaranteed to lead to a better outcome.  Selling to John for $10,000 ensures you get a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
