"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,000. Would you be willing to consider $12,500? I think this is a fair price that takes into account the product's value and our negotiation",12500.0,Bob,4,
