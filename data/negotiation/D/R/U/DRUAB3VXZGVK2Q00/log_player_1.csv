"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but lower than my minimum ($120). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Friendly Approach:**  A positive and friendly tone can help build rapport and make Bob more open to negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By offering $100, I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer without me immediately feeling pressured to accept something too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and even lower than Bob's perceived value of $80. Accepting this offer would result in a huge loss for me. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to reach a more acceptable price.
* **John's offer:** While John is willing to pay $120, it's still early in the negotiation process. I'm hoping I can get closer to that price with Bob, so I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $85? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering $85, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's counteroffer of $60. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is a ""great deal"" for him, emphasizing that he's getting a good value for his money.
* **Remaining firm:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $85 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $80.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  There's still room for negotiation, and we're only in round 4. 
* **John's offer:**  While selling to John is tempting, I'm holding out for a better deal from Bob.  I have a few more rounds to work with, and I'm not ready to give up yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $75 is still a bit low for me.  How about $80? It's right in the middle of our last two offers and would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm:**  I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price of $120, but trying to reach a compromise.
* **Compromise:**  By offering $80, I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate and reach a middle ground.
* **Appeal to fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as being ""fair for both of us,"" hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Keep negotiating:**  We are still early in the negotiation process, so I'm not ready to give in to Bob's pressure yet."
