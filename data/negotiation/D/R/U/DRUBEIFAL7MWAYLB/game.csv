"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider  $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a great compromise, considering its true value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to negotiate further. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
