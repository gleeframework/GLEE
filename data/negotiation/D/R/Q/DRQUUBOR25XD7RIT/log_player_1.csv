"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth more than $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $9500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum of $10,000, it's still significantly less than what I'd like to get. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price. I have 8 more rounds to reach an agreement, so there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand you're looking for a good deal,  $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great value for you, considering the product's worth.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  I'm still hoping to get closer to $8500.  How about we meet in the middle at $8750?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,750 is tempting, it's still significantly less than my desired price of $10,000.  I'm still willing to negotiate further.  I have 6 rounds left and can still potentially get a higher offer.  I don't want to settle too quickly, and I still believe there's room for Bob to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  $8,750 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  How about we compromise at $9,000? It's a good price for you, considering the product's value, and it's closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $9000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8800. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,800 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly less than my minimum of $10,000.  I only have 4 rounds left and need to be careful about not missing out on a better deal.  However, I'm still hopeful that I can push Bob a little higher and am not ready to settle just yet. I'm going to counteroffer one last time before considering selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,800 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,900. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. I hope we can reach an agreement in this final round before I need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 8900}
