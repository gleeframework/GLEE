Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a budget of $120. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $120?

I'm going to try and get a bit more than $120.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to settle for Bob's first offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget.  While I'm happy to work with you, $120 just doesn't cover my costs. How about $125? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I would like to propose $123 as the final price for the product. This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Bob is offering $123, which is just $3 less than my desired price.  With only 4 rounds left, I'm going to accept his offer. It's a good deal for both of us."
