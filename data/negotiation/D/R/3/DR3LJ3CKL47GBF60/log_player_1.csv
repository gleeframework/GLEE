Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'll be ready to negotiate down if Bob counters, but I want to see where he stands first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,800,000 is closer to my target price, but I think I can push for a little more. I'm going to see if I can get him to budge closer to my original asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. It's a compromise, but still a good profit for me.  I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair price, given his initial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd still prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $1,750,000 is a good profit. I'll accept his offer to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
