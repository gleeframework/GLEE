Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $10,000, but I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $10,000, giving us a baseline. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but even if he gets a small discount, it's still above our minimum.
* **Backup Option:** We have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob. 
* **Time Value:**  Selling directly to Bob might be faster than waiting for John, making a slightly higher price more appealing.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while considering Bob's perspective and our backup option."
