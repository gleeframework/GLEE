"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that figure? I appreciate your understanding.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your budget constraint,  $950,000 doesn't reflect the true value of what I'm offering.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and allows you to make a substantial profit. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget constraints, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for the product.
