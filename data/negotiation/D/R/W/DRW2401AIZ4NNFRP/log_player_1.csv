Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that figure? I appreciate your understanding. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is still a significant sum, it's lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that undervalues the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your budget constraint,  $950,000 doesn't reflect the true value of what I'm offering.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and allows you to make a substantial profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget constraints, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise between acknowledging the product's value and staying within my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is within my acceptable range and higher than what John would pay.  I'll accept it and close the deal."
