"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product, but I'm looking to secure it at a price closer to $850,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to acquire the product within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a significant profit.",875000.0,Alice,3,
