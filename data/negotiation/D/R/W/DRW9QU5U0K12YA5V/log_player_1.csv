Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product, but I'm looking to secure it at a price closer to $850,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow me to acquire the product within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
