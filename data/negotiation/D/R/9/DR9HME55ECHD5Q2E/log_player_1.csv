Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $20,000. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get closer to your ideal selling price.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and potential price flexibility. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing John is willing to buy the product at your minimum price ($15,000) gives you leverage. You are not desperate to sell below your minimum, allowing you to confidently aim higher with Bob."
