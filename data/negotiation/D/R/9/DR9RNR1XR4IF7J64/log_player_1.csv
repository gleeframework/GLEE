"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,200,000. I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is still above my minimum price of $1,200,000, but closer to Bob's offer.  I want to see if we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $1,200,000.  I'm not willing to accept a price that low, and I want to try to reach a more favorable agreement. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a compromise, still above my minimum price but closer to Bob's latest offer. I want to see if we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've been going back and forth for a while, and it seems like Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price.  I'm concerned that we're running out of rounds and I'm not going to get a good enough deal. It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
