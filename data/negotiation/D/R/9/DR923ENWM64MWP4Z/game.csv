"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I see the potential of this product, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,350,000 as a starting point.  I believe this is a fair price considering my limit and the value you've placed on it.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,350,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a figure that reflects the true value of this product.  How about we meet halfway and consider $1,575,000?",1575000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,575,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's compromise further - I'm willing to offer $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's close this deal. How about $1,512,500? This reflects the value while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1512500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm still committed to this purchase, but $1,512,500 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,480,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it's a good price for both of us.",1480000.0,Bob,6,
