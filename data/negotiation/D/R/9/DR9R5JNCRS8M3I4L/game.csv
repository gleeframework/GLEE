"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. While I understand its worth to my business, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $900000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  Let's meet in the middle at $1050000. This is a significant investment for you, but it will be a smart one that will deliver long-term benefits. I'm confident that this offer is still a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. This price aligns more closely with my financial planning while still recognizing the value of the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 simply isn't enough to make this deal work for me.  We're both close to an agreement.  I'm willing to make a final concession. Let's close this deal at $1000000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget and still allows me to make a good profit. It's a win-win for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
