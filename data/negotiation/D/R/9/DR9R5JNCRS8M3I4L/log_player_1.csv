Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. While I understand its worth to my business, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm confident I can get a higher price.  While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I'm aiming for closer to my initial asking price.  I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a significant investment for you, but it will be a smart one that will deliver long-term benefits. I'm confident that this offer is still a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's a bit closer to my goal, I still believe I can do better.  The value of this product to Bob is high, and I want to see if I can push him just a bit more. I'm not ready to settle yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 simply isn't enough to make this deal work for me.  We're both close to an agreement.  I'm willing to make a final concession. Let's close this deal at $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget and still allows me to make a good profit. It's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
