{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer starts at a point where you're willing to make a small concession but still gain a significant profit. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm looking to save as much as I can, and I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than your minimum acceptable price of $120. It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your target by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $95 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $97.5 is getting closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what John is offering. You've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet your minimum. Selling to John ensures you get your desired price and avoids further negotiation."
