"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $15000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $15000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm afraid $12000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to come down to $14000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your need to make a profit, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $14000. I'm willing to offer $13000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13000 and $14000, so I'll offer the product to you for $13500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I've already met you halfway twice, Bob, and I'm starting to think we're not going to see eye to eye. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $13250. This is my last offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",13250.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to reach an agreement, Bob. I've already met you halfway multiple times, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $13500. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll offer the product to you for $13500, and I'll also throw in a one-year warranty and a free maintenance package. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",13500.0,Alice,9,
