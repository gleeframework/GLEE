Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding your minimum price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing you a profit.
* **Time Value:**  Selling to John is your backup plan. Offering a slightly lower price to Bob first might lead to a faster sale."
