"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that's worth $10,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the perceived value to you. While $9,500 is less than your $10,000 maximum, you can get a better deal from John."
