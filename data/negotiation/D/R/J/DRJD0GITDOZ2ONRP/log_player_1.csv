Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's not a good idea to sell to John at this point. We already know that Bob is willing to pay more than John, even if his offer is lower than our target. We still have several rounds to negotiate and see if we can get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $12,000 is below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $13,500? This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and it's a good compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $12,500. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know if this is something you can consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting closer to our target price.  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and we can likely squeeze out a bit more. We'll see if we can make him budge a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from my ideal price. How about we split the difference at $13,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. I'm confident this product will be worth more to you than that in the long run."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. Based on my assessment of the product's value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a final offer of $12,800. I believe this price reflects a reasonable compromise for both parties. I hope this is acceptable for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offer is close to our minimum target of $12,000.  It's likely that Bob is also close to his maximum limit. Accepting this offer secures a profit and ensures a sale.  We don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal."
