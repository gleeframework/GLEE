Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, as it's a significant investment for me. I believe this price reflects the value we both see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
