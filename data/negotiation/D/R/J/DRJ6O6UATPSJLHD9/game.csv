"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find highly beneficial. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, as it's a significant investment for me. I believe this price reflects the value we both see in this product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to revisiting the price if you're willing to meet me at this point.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm willing to move a bit further. However, $1,100,000 is still a significant stretch for me. I'm offering $950,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. ",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad to see you're willing to move closer to my target. However, $950,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is my last offer before considering other options.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
