# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You save $150,000 by accepting Alice's offer.
* **The product's value to you is higher than Alice's offer.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, so $1,350,000 is still a good deal."
