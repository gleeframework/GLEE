"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This allows me to see how much he's willing to pay and gives me room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low for me. I need to get at least $150 for the product. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value. I believe this is a fair compromise that might be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied. It's more worthwhile to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping we can reach a price closer to my target of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still aiming for a price that's profitable for me. With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to find a compromise that Bob is willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied. With John offering a much higher price, it's more worthwhile to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

With only 3 rounds left, I'm making a final push. This price is still profitable for me and hopefully, a good compromise for Bob."
