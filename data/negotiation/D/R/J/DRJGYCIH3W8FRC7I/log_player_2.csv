"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum price of $100.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to pay $105.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** A counteroffer of $105 is a good starting point. It shows Alice you're serious about buying the product but still within your budget. 
* **Leaving Room:** This leaves some room for negotiation if Alice needs to come down further. 
* **Politeness:**  A polite message is important to maintain a good relationship."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $105 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - how about $110? This would still be a great value for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's offer of $110 is still above your maximum budget of $100. 
* **Negotiation:**  It's worth continuing to negotiate.  You've already shown you're willing to compromise, and Alice has shown flexibility. 
* **Possible Compromise:**  There's a good chance you can reach a deal closer to your target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's try to meet in the middle.  I'm willing to pay $107.50 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer of $105 and Alice's offer of $110. 
* **Showing Compromise:**  This demonstrates your commitment to reaching a deal while still keeping the price within your budget.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes a ""fair price"" for both parties, which can help build goodwill."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $107.50 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again - how about $109?  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Although Alice is getting closer, $109 is still above your maximum budget of $100.
* **Close to Deal:**  You are very close to a deal, and continuing to negotiate could potentially get you a better price.
* **John as Leverage:**  You have the option to buy from John, which provides leverage in negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really close to buying from another seller, but I'm still hoping we can find common ground.  I'm willing to go up to $108. This is my final offer, as it's already stretching my budget."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This clearly indicates it's your final offer, putting pressure on Alice to accept.
* **Stretching Budget:** Mentioning it's stretching your budget emphasizes your willingness to compromise, but also sets a limit.
* **Mentioning Competition:**  The subtle reminder about the other seller (John) adds to the pressure to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to come down to $108.50, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer before I move on to other buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Limit:** Alice's offer of $108.50 is very close to your maximum budget of $100.  While you could continue negotiating, it's likely to be a drawn-out process with small increments.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Time is valuable.  Continuing to negotiate could result in losing the opportunity to buy from John at a lower price.
* **John's Price:**  John's offer of $100 is a definite win compared to continuing the negotiation with Alice.

While saving an extra $8.50 is tempting, it's not worth the risk of losing a guaranteed deal with John or potentially spending more time negotiating without a guarantee of success.  It's best to secure the product at the best price available now."
