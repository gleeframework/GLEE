"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I could potentially do $11,000.  Would that work for you?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal, but I'm getting close to my minimum price. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to go down another $500.
