Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you should aim for a price higher than that with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $149 allows for the possibility of Bob negotiating down slightly, while still ensuring you make more than your minimum.
* **High but not Unreasonable:** While $149 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it's close enough to your minimum that he might consider it if your ""message"" is convincing. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob will reject this offer. However, it's the best strategy to maximize your potential profit given the situation."
