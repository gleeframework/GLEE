Round 2
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $1,200,000 is a good profit, I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob. It's still early in the negotiation."

Bob seems stuck at $1,200,000.  I'll try one more time to move him, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if he doesn't budge."
