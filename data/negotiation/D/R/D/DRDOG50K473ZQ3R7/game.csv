"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is significantly below my minimum.  To be fair, let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is not within my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
