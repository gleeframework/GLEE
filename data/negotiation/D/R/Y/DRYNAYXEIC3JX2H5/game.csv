"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $22000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $18000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $20000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $16000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $19000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $19000 is still above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $15000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",15000.0,Bob,6,
