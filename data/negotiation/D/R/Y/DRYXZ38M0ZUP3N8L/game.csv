"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is below my minimum.  I could meet you halfway at $9,000.  It's a fantastic deal for a product that will bring you so much value.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $9,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $8,250. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",8250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I aim for a fair deal, I can't go as low as $8,250. My final offer is $8,750.  This price reflects the product's true worth and is a small investment for the value it will bring you.",8750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $8,750. I'm willing to make one final offer of $8,500. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider purchasing the product from John for $10,000.",8500.0,Bob,6,
