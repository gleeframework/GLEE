"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident in the value this product brings, so I'm willing to come down slightly to $16,500.  This still represents a significant discount compared to my initial offer. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but $16,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $16,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",16000.0,Bob,4,
