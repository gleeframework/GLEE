"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a unique item that will bring significant value to your life. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000, as it's still below its worth to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's try to split the difference. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This feels like a fair price that respects both of our needs.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, $900,000 is still below the product's value to me. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value it holds for me.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still higher than I can comfortably go. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $900,000. This is the highest I can afford without going over budget. Let's try to close the deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value it holds for me.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
