"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $9,750? That's a fair compromise between our two offers.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll offer you the product for $10,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Alice,5,
