"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1800000 is unfortunately out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1300000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see the value you see in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1600000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a great deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1600000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1400000 for the product. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $1400000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1550000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product and the investment you're willing to make. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
