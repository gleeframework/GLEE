"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I believe it's fair given its value to me.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. My counteroffer is $880,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. What do you think?",880000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not quite there. $880,000 is closer, but I'm capped at $860,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I need to stay within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your transparency, Bob. I understand the importance of staying within your budget. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. Let's try to find a sweet spot. My counteroffer is $870,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. What do you think?",870000.0,Alice,5,
