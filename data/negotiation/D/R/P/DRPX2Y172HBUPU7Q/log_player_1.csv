"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an aggressive offer of $9,500. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a price significantly higher than my minimum of $8,000.  Since Bob values the product at $10,000, this offer is still attractive to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum, it's still worth exploring if I can get a higher price.  I'm rejecting the offer to continue negotiating with Bob and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly to $9,000.  This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, but still maintains a profitable price for me. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer, and closer to my desired price than my last offer.  I'm accepting to secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or a failed deal."
