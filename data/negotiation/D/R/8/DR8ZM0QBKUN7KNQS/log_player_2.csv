"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $145. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $145 is close to your maximum budget, you can do better. By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're looking for a lower price. She might come back with a better deal, and if not, you can always buy from John for $150."
