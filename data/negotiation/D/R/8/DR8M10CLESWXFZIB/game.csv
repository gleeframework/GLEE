"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $1,300,000 is a respectable offer, the value this product brings is truly unique. I'm willing to come down slightly, how about we meet at $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has unique value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,450,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $1,350,000 is a more reasonable price. Can we discuss further?",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. Let's bridge the gap - how about $1,400,000? This reflects the product's inherent value while acknowledging your perspective.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
