"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1800000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1400000 for the product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000 for the product. This price still aligns closely with my budget while acknowledging the value of the product.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1500000. I'm willing to meet you at $1700000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and is closer to my original offer.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
