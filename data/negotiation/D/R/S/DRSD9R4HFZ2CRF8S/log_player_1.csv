Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe you'll find very valuable. My initial offer is $200. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if you're interested in that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll try to negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is significantly lower than what I need to make this sale worthwhile. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $175. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $175 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $150.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting his offer secures me $150, which is the best I can do right now."
