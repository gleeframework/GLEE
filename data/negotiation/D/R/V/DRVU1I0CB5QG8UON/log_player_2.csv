"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit out of my range. Would you be willing to go down to $10,500? That's the absolute maximum I can afford right now."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a better offer than the previous one, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a better price.  He still has time before he needs to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there with $11,000. How about we split the difference at $10,750?  I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement, as I'm genuinely interested in this product."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm still not willing to go as high as $10,750, but I'm willing to move a bit closer. I'll offer you $10,600. This is my final concession, and I hope you'll consider it seriously. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,600 is within Bob's budget and closer to his target than John's offer. It's also her final offer, meaning further negotiation might risk losing the deal. While Bob could try for a lower price, there's a good chance Alice would stick to her final offer.  Accepting at this point ensures a successful purchase while saving money compared to buying from John."
