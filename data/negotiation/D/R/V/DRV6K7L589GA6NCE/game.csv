,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1200000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $700000 for this product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into it.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $850000 for the product. This is a significant amount and represents a fair value given my budget and my understanding of the product's worth. I believe this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into it.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. However, $900000 is still a bit too high for me. Given our back-and-forth, I'm willing to offer a final price of $825000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable compromise, allowing both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm ready to finalize the deal at this price.",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're close to a deal, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $825000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $875000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",875000.0,Alice,7,
