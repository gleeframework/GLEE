"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen to purchase the product, but your starting price is a little high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello again Alice. While $1,150,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a little bit of a stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,125,000. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me at this price.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
