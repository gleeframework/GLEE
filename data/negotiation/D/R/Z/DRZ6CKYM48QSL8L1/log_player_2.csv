# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14500. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is better than John's price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. There's room for negotiation as Alice values the product at $12,000, and Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000."
