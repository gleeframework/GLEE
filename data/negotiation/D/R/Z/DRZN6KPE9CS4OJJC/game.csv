"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000. This is a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1000000 to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. This is a fair price for me, considering the product's value to me is $1000000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900000, which still leaves you with a significant profit.  Let's find a middle ground here.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $900000. How about we meet in the middle at $920000? This way, I can still get a good deal, and you can still make a profit.",920000.0,Bob,4,
