"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $650,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, but $725,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice has stated this is her final offer and won't go lower. She's currently at $850,000. Knowing you have a standing offer from John at $800,000 it makes more sense to take the guaranteed lower price than risk Alice sticking to her word and missing out on the product entirely."
