Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($150 - $120 = $30) while still making it attractive for Bob to accept.

This strategy aims to achieve the highest possible price Bob is likely to accept, given that he's getting a $10 discount from his perceived value."
