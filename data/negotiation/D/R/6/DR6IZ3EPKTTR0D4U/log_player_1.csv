"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,500,000. It's a rare opportunity to own something truly special. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the uniqueness and potential value of the product could make Bob more willing to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends with an invitation to discuss, suggesting flexibility and openness to negotiation. 

**Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and the number of rounds remaining. If his offer is too low, I may choose to stop negotiating and sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it indicates interest in the product. I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate. 
* **Sell to John as a Backstop:**  I'm keeping John as a fallback option, but I'm not ready to sell to him just yet. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a middle ground.  I'll need to factor in the number of rounds remaining and the risk of Bob walking away completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is a bit low, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,200,000? This price reflects the unique value of the product and still leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my initial offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight Value Again:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique value and how it justifies a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive tone, suggesting openness to reaching an agreement.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to assess the situation and consider whether to further reduce my price or continue negotiations. With 7 rounds left, I still have room to maneuver."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I have 6 rounds left, and Bob is clearly interested in the product. There's still potential to negotiate a better price.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** I'm holding onto John's offer as a backup option in case negotiations with Bob fall apart.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer again, likely with a price slightly lower than my previous counteroffer.  I need to be strategic, balancing my need for a good price with the risk of losing Bob completely.  The remaining number of rounds will be a crucial factor in my decision-making."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 for the product. This reflects the unique value and potential of this product, while still being a reasonable price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession by lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000. This shows I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique qualities and potential, reinforcing the value proposition.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as beneficial for both of us, highlighting the possibility of a win-win outcome.

**Next Steps:**

* **Closely Monitor Bob's Response:** If Bob rejects again, I'll need to make a more substantial concession or risk losing him entirely. 
* **John Remains an Option:** I'm still holding onto John's offer, ready to sell to him if negotiations with Bob fail. 
* **Remaining Rounds:** With 5 rounds left, I'm running out of time to get the best price possible. I'll need to assess the risk of losing Bob versus the chance of getting a higher offer in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $980000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, $980,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:**  I have 4 rounds left, and Bob is clearly interested in the product, so there's still room for further negotiation. 
* **John's Offer is a Good Backup:** I'm not ready to settle for less than my minimum.  John's offer provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer again, aiming to find a price that's closer to my minimum. With a limited number of rounds remaining, I'll need to be strategic about my concessions and assess the potential risk of losing Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offers and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution.  Let's close this deal,  I believe this price is fair considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm making a significant concession, moving my price down to $1,050,000, which is just $50,000 above my minimum. This shows a strong commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 3 rounds left,  I'm putting pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the opportunity.

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's Response:**  If he rejects, I'll need to decide quickly whether to make a further concession or sell to John.
* **Selling to John:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John to avoid losing any further time and potential profit. 
* **Remaining Rounds:** With only 3 rounds left, I'm running out of time to get the best price possible, so I'll need to be assertive and decisive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $990000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Almost There, but Not Quite:**  While Bob's offer of $990,000 is very close to my minimum, it's still $10,000 short.  I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum.
* **Time is Running Out:** I only have two rounds left, and there's a risk that Bob will continue to make offers just below my minimum.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, which is more certain than continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

Given the time pressure and the close proximity of Bob's offer to my minimum, I'm choosing to secure the sale with John. While I would have preferred to get a bit more, the risk of losing out entirely to Bob's haggling is too high."
