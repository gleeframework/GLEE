"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening that gives me room to negotiate down if needed. I'm aiming for the best possible price while still leaving room for a few rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob that's closer to my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price that's closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,600,000. This is a further compromise, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to find a meeting point with Bob in this round, as I'm becoming increasingly concerned about losing time and potentially having to accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price that's closer to my desired outcome. While John's offer is a safe option, I'm still hoping to get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,550,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but it's still above John's offer. I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob in this round, as I'm running out of time. I'm also concerned that if I reject his offer again, he may not counter with another offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  I've reached the point where I need to be realistic.  Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, and I'm concerned that we're running out of time and that he may not counter again. While it's not my preferred outcome, selling to John at least guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and allows me to move on."
