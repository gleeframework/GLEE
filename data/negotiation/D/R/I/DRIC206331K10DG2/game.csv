"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a price closer to your asking price, Alice. While $11,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Could you do $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $10,750 is tempting, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,900. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll be going with John's offer.",10900.0,Alice,5,
