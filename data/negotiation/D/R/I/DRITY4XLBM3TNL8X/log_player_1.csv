{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. I'm confident this is a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is slightly above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate while still making a decent profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The price is below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000, so I have room to compromise if Bob counteroffers.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and positive, emphasizing mutual benefit.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** Great! I've secured a sale.
* **If Bob Rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and consider whether it's worthwhile or if I should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much money as possible. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's willing to negotiate.  I can counteroffer with a higher price and potentially reach a mutually agreeable compromise.
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I can afford to be firm in my negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is below my acceptable range, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering the product for $1,050,000. This price is still fair considering its value to you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is a midpoint between my initial offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still ensuring a profit.
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:** I'm still above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. This conveys my seriousness about earning a decent price.
* **Continuing the Negotiation:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes finding a solution that works for both of us.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** I've secured a sale at a price I'm happy with.
* **If Bob Rejects:** I'll analyze his next counteroffer and decide whether it's worth pursuing or if I should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save as much money as possible. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me and the value you place on it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** Bob's offer of $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  While it's closer, it's not enough to justify accepting it. 
* **Limited negotiating room:** There's not much room left for further negotiation.  A counteroffer from me would likely be very close to his, potentially leading to an impasse. 
* **John's offer is a safe haven:**  I can confidently reject Bob's offer knowing that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $1,200,000.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a final counteroffer to Bob, pushing him closer to my desired value. If he rejects, I will move on to John."
