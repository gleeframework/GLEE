"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still within a reasonable range for both parties. It signals to Alice that you are serious about buying the product, but also not willing to pay her full asking price.  This should open up further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? That way, we both walk away happy.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is exactly your maximum budget.  While it would be ideal to get a lower price, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.  Accepting her offer ensures you get the product within your budget."
