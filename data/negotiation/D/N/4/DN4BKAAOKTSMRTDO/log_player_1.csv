Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $750,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can do better."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me.
