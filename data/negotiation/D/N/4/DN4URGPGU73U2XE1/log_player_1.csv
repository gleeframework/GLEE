"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High starting price:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but below my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and inviting message to build rapport. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm justifying the price by referencing its value to Bob, making it seem more reasonable.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000) as possible within the 10 rounds. If Bob doesn't accept my initial offer, I'll adjust my strategy based on his response and his potential counteroffers. I also have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable value:** $900,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I believe I can still get closer to my target price with a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my target price while keeping in mind Bob's willingness to pay. I'll also carefully consider the remaining rounds and the possibility of selling to John if the negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. It's a significant price reduction from my original offer, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** I'm offering a price that's lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's latest offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains my value.
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm still using a friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a price that's acceptable to both of us. I'm willing to make concessions but I won't settle for a price that is too low. With 7 rounds remaining, I still have room to maneuver and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with the cost. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value:**  $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I have several rounds remaining and I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer.  I'm keeping in mind that selling to John for $1,000,000 is always an option if negotiations with Bob don't progress."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it's the absolute minimum I can accept.  If this doesn't work for you, I have another buyer who is interested in purchasing at this price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go lower. This creates urgency and pressure on Bob.
* **Alternative buyer:**  Mentioning another buyer adds pressure and makes Bob feel like he might miss out.
* **Minimum acceptable value:**  I'm offering my minimum acceptable price, which is $1,000,000. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm still using a friendly tone to maintain a positive negotiation environment.

**Strategy:**

This is a high-stakes round. I'm using a combination of pressure and a fair offer to try and close the deal with Bob. If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to sell to John or continue negotiating with Bob in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value:** $925,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Limited rounds remaining:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, the chances of reaching a mutually acceptable price are slim.
* **Guaranteed value from John:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.

**Strategy:**

It's not worth risking losing a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John for the possibility of a slightly higher price from Bob.  The remaining rounds are unlikely to yield a better outcome, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price than my minimum acceptable value. Selling to John is the most secure and profitable option at this point."
