"I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $105. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $97.50?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $97.50 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $102.50 for a final price. This is a fair offer considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go above $100, and I think $97.50 was a reasonable offer. I'm willing to go back to that price. Can you meet me there?",97.5,Bob,6,
