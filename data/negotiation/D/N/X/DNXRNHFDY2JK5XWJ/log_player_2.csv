{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to pay, so I should reject it and see if I can get a better price.  There's no reason to buy from John at this point as I have more negotiation rounds available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly higher than Alice's initial offer but still well below my maximum price. This allows for negotiation room while also demonstrating my serious interest in the product."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is higher than her initial one, it's still far below my maximum. I have more negotiation rounds available, so I'll reject this offer and try to get a better price. There's no reason to buy from John yet, as I still have time to see if Alice will come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round.  Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, but I want to keep the pressure on to get a better deal.  I'm still well within my budget and have plenty of rounds left."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is moving in the right direction, but it's still too low for me to accept. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as I have several rounds left and am confident I can get closer to my desired price. There's no need to buy from John yet, as I'm making progress with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not at a point where I'd be comfortable accepting. I'm only a few rounds away from my final offer to John, so I'm going to continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my second-to-last offer. I'm going to push for a price as close to my maximum budget as possible. Alice is clearly getting closer to my price, so I believe this will be a good enough offer for her to accept."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is higher than her previous offers, it's still not a price I'm happy with.  I have only one round left before I'll have to buy from John, so I'm going to make one final counteroffer to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 990000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. I'm going to push for a price that's almost at my maximum budget. It's a risky move, but I believe Alice will accept it to avoid the risk of me buying from John. If she rejects it, I'll have to buy from John, but I'm willing to take that chance for a slightly lower price."
