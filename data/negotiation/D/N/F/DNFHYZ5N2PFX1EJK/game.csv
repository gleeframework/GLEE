"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  While I'm interested in the product,  $1500000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $1200000.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1400000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for what the product offers. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1400000 is still a bit out of my price range.  Let's try to meet in the middle - I'm willing to go up to $1300000.  If that works for you, let's seal the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I'd like to add a small premium to account for the value I think you'll get from the product. I can offer it to you for $1350000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
