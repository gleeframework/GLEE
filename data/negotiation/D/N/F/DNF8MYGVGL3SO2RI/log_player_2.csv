Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that balances your budget with the value the product holds for you.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's closer, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. I can get the product for my target price from John, so I'll go with the sure thing and buy from him."
