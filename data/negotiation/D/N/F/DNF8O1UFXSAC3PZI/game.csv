"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $105.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $105, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $115 is still a bit above my budget. Let's split the difference and go with $110. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit above my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $112. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",112.0,Alice,5,
