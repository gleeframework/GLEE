"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since your maximum budget is $120, and Alice's initial offer is $120, there's no immediate benefit to accepting.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm hoping to find a price that works better for my budget. I'd be happy to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a significant discount, creating room for a possible compromise.  It's a reasonable starting point, considering the maximum budget is $120.  The message is friendly and maintains a positive tone."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure an even better deal. You still have several rounds remaining, so there's no urgency to accept a price that's not quite right."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $115 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $110.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues the negotiation, moving closer to Alice's offer while still maintaining a position within your budget.  The message remains polite and emphasizes a fair outcome for both parties.  It also highlights the importance of staying within the budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $117. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $117. How about we try $113? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $113. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $113
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and you're now only $3 away from your counteroffer.  It's reasonable to accept this offer as further negotiation may not result in a significantly lower price, especially since you have limited rounds remaining. Accepting this offer saves you $7 compared to buying from John, while staying within your budget."
