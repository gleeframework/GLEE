"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, Bob can likely negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. Offering $9,000 represents a substantial discount, but still leaves room for further negotiation. This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to bargain while keeping the price within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best price. While $11,000 is a better offer than $12,000, he believes he can negotiate even lower. There's still room for more bargaining, and rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily pushing for a lower price. Offering $10,000 is a compromise, demonstrating his willingness to meet Alice halfway.  This price point is still within his budget and likely tempting enough for Alice to consider, especially with the possibility of a deal falling through."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is a good deal for Bob. He's saved $4,500 from John's price and the negotiation is moving closer to his target.  While he could potentially continue negotiating and hope for a slightly lower price, there's a risk of the negotiation breaking down or Alice becoming unwilling to budge further. Accepting this offer secures a good price within his budget and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
