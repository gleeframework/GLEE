"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $130? It's a great compromise, and you'll still get an amazing product!",130.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",115.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet you at $125? It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us!",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $110 for the product, which is my absolute limit. Can you meet me at this price?",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're really close to your limit, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one final offer: $119. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal!",119.0,Alice,7,
