Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $100.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you could start at $119, a slightly lower offer like $100 leaves space for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Framing the Offer Positively:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob and invites a response, encouraging a positive interaction.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while maintaining a good chance of closing the deal with Bob."
