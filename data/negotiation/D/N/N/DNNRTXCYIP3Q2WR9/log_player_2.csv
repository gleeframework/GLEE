"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We can definitely try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit too high for my budget right now.  Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay much less than Alice's initial offer. Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer gives us more room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  We want to maintain a good relationship with Alice during the negotiation. Our message is polite and suggests that our offer is serious, even though it's low. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer helps us understand how flexible Alice might be on price. Her response will give us valuable information for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $85. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's offer is closer to our ideal price, but it's still above our $80 limit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** We're only in Round 3, so there's time to negotiate further. Alice's willingness to move down in price suggests she's open to a deal.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** We can use the fact that we have a backup option with John to encourage Alice to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. I'm getting closer to a budget I'm comfortable with. How about $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We don't want to jump up to $80 immediately, as that's our maximum. A smaller increase to $75 shows Alice we're willing to negotiate but still want a better deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  We maintain a positive and appreciative tone to keep the negotiation moving smoothly. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer puts us within striking distance of both Alice's last offer and our ideal price. It sets us up for potentially closing the deal in the next round or two."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $80. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Our Limit:** Alice's offer now matches our maximum budget of $80. 
* **No Guarantee of a Better Deal:** Trying to push for a lower price at this point is risky. Alice might not budge, and we'd miss out on the deal entirely.
* **Success!** We successfully negotiated a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and got the product at the best possible price."
