"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $950,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,000,000.  This would be a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product and would allow us to both walk away satisfied.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think we can do better. I'll meet you at $980,000, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",980000.0,Bob,6,
