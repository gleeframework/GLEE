"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer.  However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is certainly a respectable offer, it doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,300,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to finalize a deal closer to $1,250,000. This price would represent a fair compromise for both of us.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
