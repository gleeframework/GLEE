{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so offering it slightly above that gives him room to feel like he's getting a deal.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, so there's no need to go below $14,000.

This offer aims to strike a balance between getting the best price from Bob and securing a sale rather than risking him rejecting the offer and taking the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
