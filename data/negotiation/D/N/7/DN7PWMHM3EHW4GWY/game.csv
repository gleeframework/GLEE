"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I still think $1,025,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value and potential of the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be frank, $950,000 is cutting it close to my bottom line. I'm willing to consider $980,000 as my final offer. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $980,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable going that high. I'm willing to pay $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the value and potential of the product.",950000.0,Bob,6,
