Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm starting with a price that is higher than what the product is worth to me, but still within the range of what Bob might be willing to pay. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is interested in negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,600,000, which is still higher than what Bob offered, but closer to his offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, while still trying to get a price I'm happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price. While I could keep negotiating, John is offering my minimum price, and I'm confident I can secure a deal with him. It's not worth risking further negotiations with Bob, who seems unwilling to meet my price."
