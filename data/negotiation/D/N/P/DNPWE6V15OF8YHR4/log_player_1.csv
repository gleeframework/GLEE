Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I want to maximize my earnings, but I also don't want to risk losing him as a buyer entirely by starting too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  It's too risky to accept it, and I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $10,000, which is still above my minimum value but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to sell for anything less than $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, and while it's closer to my price, I'm not confident I can get him to go higher.  It's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer and then also losing the opportunity to sell to John.  I'll take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
