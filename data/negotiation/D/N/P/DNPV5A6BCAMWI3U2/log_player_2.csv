"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I think it's a great deal for you considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $130 is a good deal compared to John's $150, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $130 is a bit high for me. How about $110? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $120? It's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is fair:** $120 is a good price for Bob, as it's significantly lower than John's $150 and still leaves Alice with a profit.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a risk that if Bob rejects Alice's offer and counters again, Alice might walk away from the deal.  It's not guaranteed that Alice will budge further, and Bob could end up paying John's higher price. 

It's a good idea for Bob to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
