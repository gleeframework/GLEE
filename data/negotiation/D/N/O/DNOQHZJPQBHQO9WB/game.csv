"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we start at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to keep negotiations moving, but this is my final offer.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,000,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $925,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $925,000 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $975,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite there for me. I'm willing to go down to $960,000 as a final compromise. This reflects the significant value this product offers you.  Let's close this deal.",960000.0,Alice,7,
