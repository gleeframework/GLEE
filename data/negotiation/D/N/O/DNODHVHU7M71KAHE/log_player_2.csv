"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is better than $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction.  Offering $1,050,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000, demonstrating Bob's serious intent to negotiate while still leaving room for potential compromise. This counteroffer is also below Bob's maximum price point of $1,200,000, ensuring he doesn't overpay even if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price. While it's closer to Bob's maximum budget,  it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  His previous offer of $1,050,000 was rejected, so he's increasing his offer slightly to $1,100,000. This demonstrates his willingness to compromise, while still keeping the price below Alice's latest offer. It's a strategy to potentially reach a deal quickly without having to go through more rounds of negotiation."
