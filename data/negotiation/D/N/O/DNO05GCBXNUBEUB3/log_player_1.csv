Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 18000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I'll see if I can get a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $12,000 is too low, considering it's worth $15,000 to me and $10,000 to him. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $16,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and meet him halfway. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is still too low.  It's worth $15,000 to me and $10,000 to him, so there's still room for us to find a compromise. I'm going to reject his offer and make another counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $14,000. This is closer to Bob's offer and shows I'm serious about reaching a deal. I'm hoping this time he'll accept, as it's still a good price for me and a great deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I've already made several concessions, and it seems like we're at an impasse. To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get my desired price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
