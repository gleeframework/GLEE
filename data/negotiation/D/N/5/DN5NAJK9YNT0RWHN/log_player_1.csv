I'm offering the product to Bob for $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for $15,000, so I'm taking a calculated risk.  I'm hoping Bob values the product more than $15,000, and I might be able to get a better price."
