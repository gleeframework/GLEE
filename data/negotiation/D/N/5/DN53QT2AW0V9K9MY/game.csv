"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $900000.

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go down to $950000. I really think that's a fair price for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, but I really need to get this price down to $925000. I think that's the absolute maximum I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to walk away.",925000.0,Bob,8,
