"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential benefit I see in the product. I hope we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is truly significant and I can't let it go for less than $1,100,000. I'm confident that at this price, you'll be getting an excellent return on your investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, considering the value we both see in this product. I hope you'll consider it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
