Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really like. I'm offering it to you for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also positions me to earn more than John's offer if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to try to get closer to that by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a great price for a product that you'll love.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 
 
I'm making a counteroffer of $105. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows a willingness to negotiate and is closer to my desired price. I believe this price point could be appealing to Bob while still allowing me to profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still looking to keep my expenses within my budget. Would it be possible to reach an agreement at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While $100 is still less than my desired price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120 and allows me to avoid selling to John for a lower profit."
