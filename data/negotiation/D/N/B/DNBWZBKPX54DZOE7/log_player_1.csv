Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**The Goal:**  Alice wants to maximize her profit, knowing she has a guaranteed sale to John for $800,000.

**The Risk:**  If Alice asks for too much, Bob will reject her offer, and she'll have to sell to John for the baseline price.

**The Strategy:** Alice should aim for a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation to entice him while still securing a significant profit.

**The Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $875,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and a great opportunity for you."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Direct and Positive:** The message is clear and emphasizes the product's value.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The $875,000 price is a significant markup from Alice's minimum, but it leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a reasonable deal compared to his $800,000 valuation. 
* **Confidence:** Alice's tone implies she believes the product is worth the asking price, which can influence Bob's perception.

**Important Note:**  There's always a chance Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk and reward by aiming for a higher profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
