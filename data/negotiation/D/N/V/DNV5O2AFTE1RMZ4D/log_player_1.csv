Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $1,000,000
* **Bob's maximum acceptable price:** $800,000
* **John's price:** $1,000,000

By offering $950,000, I'm leaving some room for negotiation but still ensuring I make a profit. It's likely Bob will accept the offer as it's still a good deal for him, especially considering he can walk away and get the product for $1,000,000 from John. This strategy maximizes my chances of selling the product for a higher price while still having a backup option with John."
