"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $140 is less than your maximum budget, you can try to get a better price. Alice is clearly willing to sell for less than your maximum, and John's offer provides a fallback option if necessary."
