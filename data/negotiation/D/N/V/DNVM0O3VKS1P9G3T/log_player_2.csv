{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  It's above your $1,000,000 limit.
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds, so you can try to negotiate a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** You can always buy from John, so you're not under pressure to accept a bad deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above her minimum of $800,000. This shows my intent to negotiate seriously, but also sets a clear boundary.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** This gives Alice room to counter with a higher offer if she's willing to move. 
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  This counteroffer gives me a good chance of getting a better deal without risking too much by going too low.  I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate if Alice rejects this offer."

* **John's offer is a safe fallback:** I'm not in a hurry to accept a bad deal, and I can still buy from John if needed."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** My previous offer was too low, but Alice didn't budge much. I'm now offering a price closer to her last offer, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer will gauge if Alice is willing to come down further or if she's closer to her asking price.
* **Still room to negotiate:** With 6 rounds left, I can still adjust my offer if needed. 
* **Avoiding John's offer:** While John's offer is still a safety net, I'm aiming for a better deal and avoiding his high price if possible."

* **Closing the gap:** This offer is significantly closer to Alice's last offer, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Strategic positioning:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, this offer positions me to potentially secure a deal with Alice, but also allows for further negotiation if needed.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** With only 2 rounds remaining, this is my final attempt to get a price closer to my budget.
* **Significant compromise:** This offer is significantly higher than my previous one, demonstrating my willingness to meet Alice halfway.
* **Pressure on Alice:** This leaves Alice with only one round to either accept or reject, putting pressure on her to make a decision.
* **John's offer is still a backup:** If Alice rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to buy from John, but I'm hoping to avoid that outcome."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too close to my limit:**  It's only $625 away from my maximum, which is not a significant saving.
* **One round left:**  This is my last chance to negotiate, and I doubt Alice will come down any further.
* **Avoiding further haggling:**  I don't want to risk getting stuck with an even higher price if Alice makes a counteroffer in the final round.
* **John's offer is a secure option:**  It's a known price, and I'm guaranteed to get the product without further risk. 

While I'd prefer to get a slightly better deal, the risk of a last-minute price increase from Alice or a failed negotiation in the final round outweighs the potential savings. Buying from John guarantees me the product within my budget."
