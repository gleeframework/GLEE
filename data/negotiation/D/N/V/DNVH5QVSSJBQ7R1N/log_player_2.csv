You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200

Alice's offer is way over your budget.  It's best to reject and see if you can negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:

While $150 is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your limit. Rejecting and trying to negotiate a bit further makes sense, as you can always fall back on John if the negotiations stall."
