"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price to reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is still a very good price considering the product's potential and the value it can bring to your company. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $1,100,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really believe this product could be a great fit for my company, and I'm willing to pay a premium for it. Can we meet at this price?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
