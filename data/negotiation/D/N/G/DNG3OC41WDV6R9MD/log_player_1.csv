Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob ($100) and what I'd be willing to accept from John ($150). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** There's room for Bob to counteroffer and for us to find a price we're both happy with.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can get a higher price from Bob by counteroffering, especially since he expressed interest in the product.  
* **Selling to John is a fallback:** While I could sell to John for $150, I want to see if I can get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $120 is a little too low for me. How about $140? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($150) and Bob's offer ($120). 
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" aspect for Bob, which might make him more willing to compromise.
* **Staying firm:** I'm not accepting Bob's initial offer, but I'm showing flexibility by offering a counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $130 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk of losing the sale:** If I reject this offer and try to counteroffer, Bob might walk away, leaving me with the option of selling to John for $150. 
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag on and might not lead to a better outcome. 

Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision."
