"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still above your desired price point.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $750,000 for this product.  I believe this price is fair given its value to me, and it would allow us both to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to achieve a successful outcome.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is now at the maximum price I'm willing to pay.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product without exceeding my budget.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that I'll be able to get a lower price, and I risk losing the opportunity to buy from Alice altogether.  Buying from John for the same price would be a waste of time and effort."
