"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening Offer:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum ($10,000) but still within a reasonable range. This allows for negotiation and provides room for me to adjust the price.
* **Message:** My message is friendly and highlights the value proposition of the product. This builds rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I'm aiming to get a sense of Bob's interest and gauge how much he values the product. If he rejects the offer, I'll adjust my counter-offers based on his response. 
* **John as Safety Net:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $10,000, which gives me a fallback option if negotiations with Bob don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not immediately satisfied with his offer. I'm hoping to get a higher price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and proceed with counter-offers. This allows me to explore if I can get a better price.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $10,000 is a viable option, but I'm not willing to settle for that yet. I have 8 more rounds to potentially get a better deal from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer in round 3, aiming for a price higher than $10,000. I'll use information from Bob's message and his offer to gauge his willingness to pay and determine a reasonable counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, considering your interest and the potential value of the product. This is my final offer for this round."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  My counter-offer is a compromise.  I'm reducing my price from $15,000 to $12,000, showing flexibility but also demonstrating that I'm not willing to settle for Bob's initial offer. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while stating my reasons for rejecting it. I'm trying to build on our rapport and make my counter-offer seem like a fair compromise.
* **Final Offer:**  I'm using ""final offer"" to potentially create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer. However, I retain the flexibility to negotiate further in the next rounds.

**Negotiation Strategy:**

* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** I'm paying attention to Bob's response to see if he's willing to move closer to my price.
* **Assess my Options:** I'm considering whether to keep negotiating with Bob or if I should eventually accept John's offer of $10,000. 
* **Prioritize Profit:**  My goal is to maximize profit, but I also want to maintain a positive relationship with Bob in case I need to sell to him in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, his latest offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I am choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation. I believe there is still room for improvement in the price.  
* **John's Offer:**  I'm not yet willing to settle for John's offer of $10,000 because I'm hoping to achieve a better price from Bob, considering I have 6 more rounds to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counter-offer to Bob that is higher than $9,500 but lower than my previous $12,000 offer. This will demonstrate my flexibility while maintaining a goal of maximizing my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to demonstrate my commitment to making this deal work. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer by reducing my price to $11,000, which is still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still trying to achieve a good profit.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify my counter-offer. This could persuade Bob to see the value and move closer to my price.
* **Final Offer:** I'm again using ""final offer"" to potentially create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer. This is a tactic I'm using to see if I can secure a deal before moving on to my fallback option.

**Negotiation Strategy:**

* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** I'm watching for any signs that Bob is moving closer to my price. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to consider if continuing negotiations is worthwhile.
* **Weigh My Options:** I'm carefully assessing my options.  I need to weigh the potential of getting a higher price from Bob with the risk of losing him as a buyer and needing to sell to John.
* **Prioritize Profit:** My primary goal is to maximize my profit. However, I'm also mindful of the potential for future sales to Bob if we can build a positive relationship through this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down again, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** While I've shown flexibility, Bob's offers are consistently too low.  There is a risk that further negotiation will only drive the price lower, and I may not be able to reach an agreement.
* **John's Offer:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, I'm concerned that I won't be able to get a better price from Bob.  It's better to accept John's offer of $10,000, which meets my minimum requirement and guarantees a sale.

**Decision:** I've decided to sell the product to John for $10,000. This decision is based on a combination of factors:

* **Time Constraint:**  With limited rounds left, it's unlikely I'll be able to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Minimum Acceptable Price:**  John's offer meets my minimum requirement. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  By selling to John, I'm eliminating the risk of ending up with no sale.

**Future Negotiations:**

Although I'm choosing to sell to John in this scenario, I'll keep in mind that Bob showed some interest in the product.  I'll be sure to keep him informed about future products or opportunities that might be of interest to him. This can help build a long-term relationship with Bob, potentially leading to future sales."
