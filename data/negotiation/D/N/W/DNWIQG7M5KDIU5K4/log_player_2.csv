"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me and still a good value for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal compared to the product's value to Alice, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering it's well below your asking price and still within my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  At this point, Bob has two options:

1. **Continue negotiating:** This risks a stalemate or Alice making further counteroffers that are still too high for Bob.
2. **Buy from John:** This guarantees Bob the product at his maximum budget.

Since Bob's priority is to save money, the most sensible option is to buy the product from John."
