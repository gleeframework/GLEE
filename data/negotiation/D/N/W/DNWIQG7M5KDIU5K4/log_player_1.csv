Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering it's well below your asking price and still within my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
