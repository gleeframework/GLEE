Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but given the value of the product, I need to maintain a minimum price. I am willing to negotiate, so I propose a price of $11,500 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and your offer, I would like to suggest a price of $10,800. This is a fair compromise between our positions. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. The price of $10,800 is within his budget and a good compromise. It's also a better deal than buying from John for $12,000.  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
