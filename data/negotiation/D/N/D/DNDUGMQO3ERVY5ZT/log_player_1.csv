Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible without losing him to a rejection.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, still netting you a significant profit.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By emphasizing a limited-time offer and exclusivity, we increase the perceived value and encourage Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still accounting for the risk of him rejecting the offer."
