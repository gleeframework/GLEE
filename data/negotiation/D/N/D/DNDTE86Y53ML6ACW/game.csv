"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $90? That's still a good profit for you.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100, but I'm still a bit too high. I'm happy to pay $95. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would save me a few bucks.",95.0,Bob,4,
