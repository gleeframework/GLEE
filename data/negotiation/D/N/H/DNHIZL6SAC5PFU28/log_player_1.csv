{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $1,200,000. 
* **John as Backup:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, ensuring you won't go below your minimum.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to maximize profit while ensuring Bob finds the offer appealing enough to accept. Offering the product at $1,400,000 allows room for negotiation while aiming for a price above both your minimum and Bob's valuation. If Bob negotiates, you have room to decrease the price and still make a significant profit."
