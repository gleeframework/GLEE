Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is my maximum offer, given its value to me.  I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my maximum budget, I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This shows my commitment to acquiring this product, but it's important for us to find a compromise that works for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm firm at $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents my maximum budget for this product. If you're willing to accept this, we can finalize the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Bob is holding firm at $1,000,000 and it's unlikely he'll budge.  While a deal at $1,100,000-1,200,000 might have been possible, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially losing John's offer. Accepting John's offer guarantees you your minimum acceptable price."
