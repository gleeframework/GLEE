"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I propose a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is my maximum offer, given its value to me.  I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's potential.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a considerable compromise, reflecting my desire to see this product in your capable hands.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my maximum budget, I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This shows my commitment to acquiring this product, but it's important for us to find a compromise that works for both of us. ",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,250,000? This offer splits the difference between our previous positions and represents a fair deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm firm at $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents my maximum budget for this product. If you're willing to accept this, we can finalize the deal. ",1000000.0,Bob,6,
