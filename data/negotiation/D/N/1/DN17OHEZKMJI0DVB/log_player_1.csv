{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize your profit:**  The initial offer is close to your minimum acceptable value, giving you a good starting point.
* **Encourage negotiation:**  The message invites Bob to engage in a conversation, which could lead to a mutually beneficial outcome. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  You can always fall back on selling to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $950,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  $950,000 is too low for the product's worth to me. 
* **Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Alternative:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $1,200,000, giving me a solid fallback option. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my minimum value, aiming to bridge the gap and potentially reach an agreement."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $950,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This price still offers you a great value, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer of $1,025,000 is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000. 
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for both of us. It suggests a willingness to compromise while staying within my acceptable range.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Signal flexibility:** Shows Bob that I am open to negotiation.
* **Find common ground:** A middle ground price increases the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Maintain leverage:** I still have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if Bob doesn't accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $980,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $980,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not enough.  I'm not willing to accept a loss on this product.

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  $980,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation:**  I believe there is still room for negotiation, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Alternative:**  I have a solid fallback option with John, which gives me leverage during the negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum value, aiming to bridge the remaining gap. I'm willing to be flexible but will not settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $980,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work.

Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Explanation:**

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:
