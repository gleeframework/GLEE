{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as much as possible from the sale.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100, so I need to offer it below that for him to be interested.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** I have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, so I don't need to go below that.

By offering the product at $125, I'm aiming for a price that's:

* **Attractive to Bob:** It's a significant discount from his perceived value.
* **Profitable for Me:** It's still a decent profit margin above my minimum. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'm happy to sell to John for my guaranteed $150."
