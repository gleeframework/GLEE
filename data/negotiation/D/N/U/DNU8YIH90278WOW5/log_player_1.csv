"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire a truly valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects its inherent value, but I'm open to discussing further."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired selling point. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's willingness to pay.
* **Near Bob's Value:** The offer is close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) while still providing a significant profit margin for you.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message emphasizes openness to negotiation, signaling to Bob that you're willing to find a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I think $1,100,000 is a bit high.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good profit, we're still early in the negotiation. Bob's counteroffer indicates he's very interested and there's room to negotiate further towards a price closer to his perceived value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional value. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,025,000.  This reflects its true worth while recognizing your investment."", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're coming down in price, but not too drastically. A $75,000 decrease shows flexibility while still aiming for a high profit.
* **Justify the Value:** The message reinforces the product's value and positions the counteroffer as a balanced approach.
* **Maintain Momentum:**  By making a counteroffer, we're keeping the negotiation moving forward and encouraging Bob to continue engaging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the revised offer. However, $1,025,000 remains a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $950,000? I'm keen to finalize this soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to a price point that could be beneficial for both of us. While $950,000 is tempting, we still have room to negotiate and aim for a higher price without risking losing him entirely at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your desire to finalize this quickly and I'm happy we're finding common ground.  How about we split the difference and settle at $987,500?  This reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 987500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Urgency:**  We're showing Bob that we're willing to compromise and meet him halfway while acknowledging his desire for a quick resolution. This fosters goodwill and creates a sense of urgency.
* **Strong Profit Margin:**  $987,500 is still a very strong profit margin that significantly exceeds our minimum selling point.
* **Clear and Simple:**  The ""splitting the difference"" approach is easy to understand and portrays fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be completely transparent, I have a firm budget for this purchase, and to make it work, I'd need to get the price down to $960,000.  Would that be possible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $960,000 is still a fantastic profit, exceeding our minimum by $160,000. 
* **""Budget"" Signal:** Bob is signaling that this is likely his final offer. Pushing further risks losing the deal.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids further negotiation rounds and gets us the money sooner, which has its own value."
