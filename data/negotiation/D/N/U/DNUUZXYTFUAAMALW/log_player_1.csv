Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

This offer gives me a good chance of maximizing my profit. 

* **Reasoning:** 
    * The product is worth $8,000 to Bob, so he's likely to accept an offer slightly higher than that.
    * I'm willing to sell to John for $10,000, so anything above $9,500 is a win.
    * Offering $9,500 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters with a lower price."
