"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $100. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to Alice and $120 to Bob.  Bob can get a better deal from John, so it's worth rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $90? "", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $92.50 is better than John's price, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. There are still several rounds left, and Bob might be able to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit too high. How about $91? It's a small step closer to my ideal price, and hopefully, we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 91}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I'm willing to make a small adjustment to $92. I think this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $92, which is still a good deal for Bob. It's a better price than John's $120, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better price. Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price with several rounds remaining."
