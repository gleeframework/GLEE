"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Buying from Alice saves you money:**  Alice's offer of $9,000 is lower than the $10,000 you would pay John.
* **You value the product:** Your willingness to pay up to $10,000 demonstrates that the product is worth the cost to you. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option to achieve your goal of saving money while still acquiring the product."
