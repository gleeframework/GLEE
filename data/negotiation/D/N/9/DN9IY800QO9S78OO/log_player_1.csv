"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this is a reasonable starting point, as it gives Bob a good deal while still allowing me to make a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable value, and it doesn't reflect the true worth of the product.  I will reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $11,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly higher than his initial offer. I'm hoping this counteroffer will entice him to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not a good enough deal for me.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob.  There are still rounds left, and I'm hoping to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm reducing my price again to $10,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept. I'm willing to meet him halfway, and I think this price is fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I'm confident that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can secure a deal that's more favorable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm offering a price of $9,800. This is just a small step from Bob's last offer, but it's a clear sign that I'm willing to come down to almost his price.  With only a few rounds left, I want to make a final push to see if we can close the deal."
