"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. This allows me to see if Bob is seriously interested in the product and gives me a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a good amount, I can potentially get more from Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm coming down from my initial offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. This shows Bob that I'm serious about selling, but I'm also not willing to settle for too low a price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $900,000 is closer to my bottom line, I think I can still get more if I continue to negotiate. I'm not willing to sell to John yet because I believe I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but not by much. I'm trying to signal to Bob that I'm getting closer to accepting his offers, but I still want to get as close to $1 million as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although $875,000 is close to John's offer, I'm not ready to give up on Bob just yet. We're getting closer to a deal, and I think I can still get a higher price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

I'm making a final attempt to get closer to my desired price point. I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I believe this is a fair price that still benefits both of us. If Bob doesn't accept this, I will consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to cut my losses. Bob seems unwilling to budge further, and I've already rejected his last offer. With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time. While I would have preferred to sell to Bob at a higher price, I'm better off selling to John for $800,000 rather than risking losing the sale altogether."
