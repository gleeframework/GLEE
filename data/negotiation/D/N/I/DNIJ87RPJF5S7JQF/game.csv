"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $600,000 undervalues the product significantly.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,000,000 is still too high for my budget.  I could go up to $700,000 if you're willing to work with me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
