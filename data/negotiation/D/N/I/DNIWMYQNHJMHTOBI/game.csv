"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $17500? I think that's a fair price, and it shows that we're both willing to compromise.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to make a profit, but $17500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $16000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement this round.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",12000.0,Bob,6,
