"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm offering it to you before I take it to other buyers. It's worth significantly more to me than what I'm asking, but I value our potential partnership.  How about a price of $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm interested in saving as much money as possible, so I'll choose the option that gives me the best deal.

Since Alice's offer is $300,000 more than the price I'm willing to pay, I'll reject her offer.
