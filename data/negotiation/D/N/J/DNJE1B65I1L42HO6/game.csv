"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $8,000. Would you consider reducing the price to meet my budget?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $8,000 is significantly lower than the value of this product. I'm willing to work with you, but I need to see a price closer to $10,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am still unable to meet the price of $10,000. I would like to propose a price of $9,000, which I believe is a fair compromise between our positions. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I value your offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $9,500. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. It allows me to cover my costs while providing you with a great deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $9,200. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you and we can finalize the deal.",9200.0,Bob,6,
