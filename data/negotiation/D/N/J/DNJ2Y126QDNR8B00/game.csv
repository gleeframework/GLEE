"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to exploring possibilities that benefit both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget. How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation and understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated.  However, we need to find a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer considering the unique benefits it offers.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but I need you to come down a bit more.  $1,150,000 is my final offer â€“ I believe that's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
