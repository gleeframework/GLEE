"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $12000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
