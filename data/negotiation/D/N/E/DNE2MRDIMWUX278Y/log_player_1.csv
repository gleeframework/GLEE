(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is finally at a point where it's worth accepting.  It's a good profit for you, and you're getting closer to your desired price.  Continuing to negotiate might get you a slightly higher price, but the risk of losing the deal is too high at this point."
