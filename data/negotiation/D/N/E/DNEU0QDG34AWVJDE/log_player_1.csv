Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This gives me a good profit margin while still being potentially attractive to Bob.  I'll see if he's willing to pay that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $140 is better than selling to John, I think I can get closer to my original asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm going to counter with $145. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be enough to convince him to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $145, Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate and this price is still good for me.  It's better than selling to John and risks further negotiation."
