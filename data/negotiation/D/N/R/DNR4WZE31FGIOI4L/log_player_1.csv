Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but not unreasonable allows for potential counter-offers while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice still gets a guaranteed $8,000."
