"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to sell. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $900,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle on $925,000? This price is a fair reflection of the value of the product, and it allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's close this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
