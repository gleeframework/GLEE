Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below what I had in mind.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $14,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $15,000 mark I need. It's better to take the guaranteed offer from John and avoid further negotiation."
