Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product at $1,400,000. This price reflects the significant value it holds for you, and it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness and Justification:**  I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob, making the price seem justifiable.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm explicitly stating that this is a starting point, inviting Bob to counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts:  Great, we have a deal!
* If Bob rejects:  I'll assess his counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing the negotiation or if it's time to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John guarantees me a much higher profit. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain leverage in the negotiation. I can potentially push for a higher price by demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to find a compromise that's mutually beneficial.
* I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed sale with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to accept.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm making a counter-offer to show willingness to negotiate while still protecting my bottom line.
* **Bridging the Gap:** The $1,250,000 offer is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still well above Bob's initial offer. This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a reasonable price.
* **Appeal to Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us. This encourages Bob to see the value in reaching an agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* **Wait for Bob's response.**  I'll analyze his next move and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* **Prepare for Further Negotiation:**  I'm ready to continue negotiations if necessary, keeping in mind my minimum price and John's offer as leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,150,000. Would that be agreeable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum.
* **Risk of Stalemate:** Continuing the negotiation with Bob risks a stalemate, leading to lost time and potentially a lower price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a final counteroffer to Bob, slightly higher than his last offer, to see if we can reach a compromise. If he rejects, I will sell the product to John.
* I will be firm in my counteroffer, emphasizing my minimum price and John's offer as leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still too far below my minimum.  Given the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to make one final concession and come down to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the benefits you'll receive from the product. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** This counteroffer is a small step towards Bob's last offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob to justify the price.
* **Set a Deadline:** The message subtly implies that this is my final offer.  It creates a sense of urgency for Bob to consider it seriously.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:** I state my willingness to sell to John, signaling that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will carefully analyze Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000. 
* I am confident that this counteroffer will be the final step in securing a deal with Bob or moving on to John for a guaranteed sale."
