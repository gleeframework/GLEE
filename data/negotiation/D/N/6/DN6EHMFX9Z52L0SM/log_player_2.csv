{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, it's still above my desired price point. I'm only two rounds away from being able to buy from John for $80, so I'm going to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 102}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $102. This is a small increase from my previous offer, showing that I'm close to accepting, but still looking for a bit more of a discount. This is my last chance to negotiate with Alice before having to potentially buy from John. Hopefully, she'll accept this offer or make a counteroffer that's closer to my budget."
