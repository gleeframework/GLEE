"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for reaching out! While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to consider $6,000?"", ""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm beginning with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) than my actual limit ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate upwards and hopefully secure a price closer to my target.
* **Polite and Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and respectful tone is important for a successful negotiation. 
* **Expressing Interest:**  I acknowledge the product's value but clearly state my budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but it's still above our target. We have room to negotiate further and see if we can get closer to $8,000.  We are not in a hurry, as we have plenty of rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** We're moving closer to our maximum budget ($8,000) while still aiming to secure a good deal. 
* **Compromise Emphasis:** By suggesting $7,500, we're directly referencing the compromise Alice mentioned (""meeting halfway""). This can help keep the negotiation moving smoothly.
* **Direct and Clear:** The offer is straightforward, leaving no room for misinterpretation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting very close to our limit, but we're only $500 away from John's price. It's worth one more try to see if we can get Alice to budge a little more. If not, we'll take John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, you're really close.  I can do $8,200, and I think that's a very fair offer considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** We're making a final offer slightly above John's price to see if Alice will accept. 
* **Justification:**  We're reiterating our position that the offer is fair, subtly reminding Alice that we have other options.
* **Decision Point:** If Alice rejects this offer, we will likely take John's deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $8,200, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $8,400, which is still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to budge below $8,400. At this point, it's more advantageous to take John's offer of $8,000. We've negotiated well and gotten Alice down significantly, but we're reaching the point of diminishing returns. It's time to secure the product at the best possible price."
