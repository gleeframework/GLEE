"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a relatively high price, $15,000. This is above my minimum value of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a significant amount for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, I believe I can get more. Bob's offer shows he's interested, and I'm confident I can push the price higher. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm counter-offering with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm trying to find a price that's both fair and appealing to Bob. It's likely he'll be willing to pay a little more than $12,000, but I don't want to push him away with a price that's too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is only $500 less than my counteroffer and very close to my desired price.  It's likely I won't get a much better offer in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal."
