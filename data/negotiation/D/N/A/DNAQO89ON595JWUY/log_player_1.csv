Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. I know it's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it would be a shame for me to let it go for less. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The offer price is $12,000.** This is above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, giving him a potential profit if he chooses to buy. 
* **The message highlights the potential for a good deal for Bob.** It also subtly emphasizes the value of the product to Alice by mentioning her minimum price.
* **The offer is still below Alice's minimum desired price of $15,000.** This allows for a potential negotiation if Bob counters, and it also leaves room for Alice to potentially make a higher profit if she sells to John instead."
