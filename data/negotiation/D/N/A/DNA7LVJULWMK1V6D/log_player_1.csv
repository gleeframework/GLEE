"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my absolute minimum price, $1,000,000. This is the price I'd be willing to accept from John, and since Bob values the product at $800,000, he has some room to negotiate. This strategy maximizes my potential profit while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial asking price, but it's a step closer to my minimum price of $1,000,000 and leaves some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm raising my counteroffer to $975,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but it demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate while still holding out for a price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob are taking too long and the offers are not reaching my minimum price. It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John rather than risk further rounds with Bob and potentially end up with less."
