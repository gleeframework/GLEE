"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great deal for you, Bob! I'm willing to sell this amazing product to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While $100 is a decent price and below your maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to go lower.  You'll try to get a better deal from Alice before resorting to John's higher price."
