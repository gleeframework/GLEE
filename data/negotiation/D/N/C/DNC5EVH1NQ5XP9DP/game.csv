"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,500 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to try to get closer to my target. Would you be willing to consider $8,750? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a fair compromise for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product.  How about $8,900? It's a compromise, and it allows us to finalize the deal. Let me know if this works for you.",8900.0,Alice,5,
