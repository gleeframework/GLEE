Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge beyond $100.  While you could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll suddenly jump to a price that's acceptable for you.  John offers a guaranteed $150, which is your minimum acceptable price.  It's better to take the sure thing than risk getting less from Bob."
