{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $8,250 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept $8,400 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 8400}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $8,200 is better than the $8,000 I would get from John.  It's also getting closer to my desired price, and with only a few rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
