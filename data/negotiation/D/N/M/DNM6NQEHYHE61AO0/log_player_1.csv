Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower offer, but it's also a price I'm comfortable with. I'll keep John's offer of $15,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'll counteroffer with a slightly lower price, but I'm not going to accept his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $18,000.  This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer, which might make him more likely to accept. I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and is within the range I was willing to negotiate. I'd rather sell to Bob than John and take a chance on a lower price in the next round."
