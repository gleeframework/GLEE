# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth attempting to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a better price. You can counteroffer and potentially save yourself some money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go below $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1075000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is still above your budget.  While it is closer to your goal, it is more beneficial to you to buy from John and avoid further negotiation. You've already established your maximum price with Alice, and it's likely she won't go lower."
