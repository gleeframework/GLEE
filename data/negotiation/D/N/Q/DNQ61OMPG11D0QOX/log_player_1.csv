Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it will be very valuable to you!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to feel like he might get a slightly better deal, even though it's already very close to his maximum.
* **Secure the Higher Sale:**  While you have a guaranteed $100 from John, selling to Bob at $119 yields a significantly higher profit. 

This strategy balances ambition with a high probability of success."
