"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'll counter with $1,025,000. This is as low as I can go, but I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll counter with $1,050,000, which is my absolute minimum. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to explore other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
