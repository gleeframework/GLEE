Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, it's still a bit high. I believe I can push for a better deal, especially since we've already established a negotiation pattern."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}

I'm going to make a final push for a price that's within my desired range. $800,000 is a fair compromise that shows I'm willing to meet her halfway.  If she rejects this, I might have to consider John's offer."
