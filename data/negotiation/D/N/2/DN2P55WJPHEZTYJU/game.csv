,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks Alice, I appreciate your offer.  However, $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and giving you a reasonable profit.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. After reconsidering, I'm willing to offer you the product for $10,800. This is still a good compromise, considering the value the product brings to you.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,200 for the product. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can find a solution that works for everyone.",10200.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $10,600 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $10,200.  This is a fair price for both of us and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but if we can't reach a deal, I will have to consider other options.",10200.0,Bob,6,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,400 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to offer you $10,300. This is my final offer, and it's a good deal for both of us.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options.",10300.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm not willing to accept $10,300. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $10,350. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling the product to another buyer.",10350.0,Alice,9,
