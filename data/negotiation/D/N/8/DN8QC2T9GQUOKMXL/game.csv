"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm prepared to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's a starting point for us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I can't accept that price just yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This reflects the value you place on the product while giving me a fair return.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000. It's a fair price, and I believe it allows for both of us to get a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
