"Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling you a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $120. Is this something you'd be interested in?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a little high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $117.50. I'm sure we can both agree that's a fair price.",117.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure $117.50 is enough to cover my costs, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we go with $130? It's still a good deal for you, and I feel more comfortable with that price.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $130 is still above my budget.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. How about $122.50?  It's closer to your price than my last offer, and it gives me some wiggle room.",122.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $122.50. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $135? I think that's the best we can do.",135.0,Alice,7,
