"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I understand the product's value, but that price is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll offer the product to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Could we possibly settle on $700,000? I'm eager to make this work.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $700,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'll offer the product to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can make it work at this price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid $850,000 is still beyond my limit. I'd be happy to close the deal right now for $750,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm ready to move forward if you are.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000, Bob. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make a profit. However, I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll offer the product to you for $825,000. This is my absolute final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",825000.0,Alice,7,
