"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $70. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer of $70 is less than your maximum price of $80 and also a good discount from John's price. It makes the most sense to accept this offer."
