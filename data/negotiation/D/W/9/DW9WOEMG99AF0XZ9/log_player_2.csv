"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you have a safety net with John offering the product for your maximum price, it makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice. There's a chance she's willing to sell for less, and even if she's not, you can always fall back on John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and gives Alice room to counter without feeling like she's losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, but I'm still willing to try and negotiate further.  Since I have a safety net with John, there's no rush to accept, and I can see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also not willing to accept her initial price. I'm aiming for a middle ground, hoping to reach a mutually acceptable price."
