"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  Considering the value of the product to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price, given that I'm confident I can generate significant returns from this product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $850,000 significantly undervalues the true potential and worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise while acknowledging the immense value it holds.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my acceptable range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This reflects a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. Let's find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
