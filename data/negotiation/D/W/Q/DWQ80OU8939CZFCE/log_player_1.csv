{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still attractive enough to potentially get a quick deal.  I'm also leaving room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my investment within $10000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. It's a significant discount from my original offer, and I'm confident the product will be worth it to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
