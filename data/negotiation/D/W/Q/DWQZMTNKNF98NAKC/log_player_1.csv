"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting with a high price, but leaving some room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is a decent price, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired range. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still leaving room for negotiation. I think $900,000 is a fair price considering the value to Bob, and it's a good starting point for this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob is getting closer to my desired range.  I'm going to accept his offer of $875,000. It's a good deal, and it's better than selling to John for less."
