``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum desired price, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to strike a deal quickly, but I'm prepared to counter if he rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my minimum desired price. While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I think I can get closer to that amount with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $9,750? That seems like a fair compromise, considering the value of the product for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $9,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation with Bob, hoping to reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $10,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product for each of us. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
