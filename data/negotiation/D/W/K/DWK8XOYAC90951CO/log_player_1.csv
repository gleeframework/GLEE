Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price closer to its actual market value. Would you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I also can't sell it for $6,000, as it's worth at least $10,000 to me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I've already compromised significantly by offering it to you for $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from there, not from the original price. Let's try $8,500.
