"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price closer to its actual market value. Would you consider a lower price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I also can't sell it for $6,000, as it's worth at least $10,000 to me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've already compromised significantly by offering it to you for $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from there, not from the original price. Let's try $8,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
