"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's important to establish a high starting point to maximize my potential profit. It also allows room for negotiation if Bob rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my desired price. I believe there's room for further negotiation and I want to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering Bob with $950,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than his offer. I believe this price is a fair middle ground and increases the chance of a deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting offers, I might risk losing him entirely. $925,000 is a good price and I don't want to risk getting a lower offer from him or having to sell to John for less."
