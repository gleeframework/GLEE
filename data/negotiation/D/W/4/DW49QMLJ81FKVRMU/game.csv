"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm keen on the product but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $725,000 is the highest I can go. Let me know if that works for you.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $725,000 is your limit, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
