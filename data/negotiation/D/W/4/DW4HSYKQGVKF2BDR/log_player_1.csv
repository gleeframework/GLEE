{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
 
This offer is in the middle of your minimum acceptable price ($8,000) and Bob's estimated value ($12,000).  It gives Bob room to negotiate while also ensuring you get a good price.  

It's important to remember:

* **Always be ready to walk away:**  You have a backup offer from John, so you don't have to settle for a price you're not happy with.
* **Be prepared to negotiate:** Bob might counteroffer, and you'll need to decide if it's worth accepting or making a counteroffer of your own."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. Would you consider $9,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $9,000 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While you could try to get closer to your original asking price, accepting his offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation or potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
