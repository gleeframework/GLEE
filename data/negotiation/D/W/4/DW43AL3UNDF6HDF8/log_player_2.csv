""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, but that's my final offer.  Think about it, you'd still be getting the product for a price lower than its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about $7,000? That's a fair offer considering John is offering it to me right now for $8,000."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $7,000 simply won't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,500. This is a fair price considering its worth to you and the fact that John is offering $8,000. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Explanation:  While Alice is trying to meet in the middle, it's clear she's aiming for a price above John's offer. Since you can get the product for $8,000 from John, there's no need to negotiate further with Alice."
