"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive message:** A friendly message can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open-ended question:** This encourages Bob to engage and potentially counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I believe I can come up with a fair price for both of us. How about $120 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not desperate. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more. I still have plenty of rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm making a counter-offer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Compromise language:**  ""Split the difference"" suggests I'm willing to be flexible.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my counter-offer, which can make it more persuasive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering the current market value and my budget, how about we settle for $130 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $130 is only $5 less than my previous counteroffer. I've already rejected his previous offer at $120, so this is a good opportunity to close the deal. With only 6 rounds remaining, it's better to secure a sale now than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John."
