"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $1000000 is a good starting point, I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this unique product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This reflects the value I know it holds, and I'm confident it will be a smart investment for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1100000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1050000?  This seems like a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
