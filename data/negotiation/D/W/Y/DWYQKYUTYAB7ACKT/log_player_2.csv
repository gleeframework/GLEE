"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $115. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you, so I think this is a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a good price, it's still above my $120 limit. I want to see if I can get a better deal from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $110? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
