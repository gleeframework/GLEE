"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $800,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  This would still be a great deal for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $700,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $650,000. This is a significant price reduction from your initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm not willing to go down to $650,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and counteroffer at $675,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",675000.0,Alice,5,
