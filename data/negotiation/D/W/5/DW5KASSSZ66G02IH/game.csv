"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its potential. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This offer represents a substantial investment from your side, but I'm confident the product will deliver exceptional returns.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $925,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
