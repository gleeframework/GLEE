Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, how about $1,350,000? This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can both be happy with this deal.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can still get the product from John for $1,200,000, which is a better deal than Alice's current offer.  There's no need to accept a higher price when a better option exists."
