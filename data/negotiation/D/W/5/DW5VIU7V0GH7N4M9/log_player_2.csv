"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe a price of $1,100,000 reflects its worth fairly. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and a better price than buying from John. Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous choice."
