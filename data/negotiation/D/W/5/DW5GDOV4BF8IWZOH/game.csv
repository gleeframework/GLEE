"I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this exclusive product to you for $18000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the exclusivity, $18000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm interested, but I can only offer $13500 at this time. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $16000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $14500.  This is my final offer before I explore other options.  Let me know if you're able to accept.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your commitment to finding a deal, Bob. However, $14500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go to $15500. This is my best and final offer, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $15500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with, considering I can get the product elsewhere for $15000.  I'm willing to go up to $15250.  This is my final offer, and I'm sure we can both walk away happy with this deal.",15250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to go up to $15250, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go below $16000. I'll meet you at $15750, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer.",15750.0,Alice,7,
