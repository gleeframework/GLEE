Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:**  I'm not asking for my minimum ($120) right away to avoid an immediate rejection.
* **Building Rapport:**  My message is friendly and builds a bit of rapport before getting to the price. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it (if it's close to my minimum) or make a counteroffer closer to $100.
* If the negotiation drags on or I feel I'm not getting close to my minimum, I'll switch to John to guarantee my $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $85 is significantly lower than my minimum of $120. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob is interested in the product, there's still room for negotiation. I can likely get closer to my minimum by making a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than $85, aiming to bridge the gap.  
* **Assess Situation:** I'll carefully monitor Bob's reactions and willingness to negotiate. If he seems unwilling to budge, I'll  consider selling to John to secure my minimum."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $95? That's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives us both a win."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer of $95 is a compromise between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $85. It shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and cooperative tone to encourage Bob to keep negotiating.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's Response:** I'll closely monitor Bob's reaction to this counteroffer.
* **Further Negotiation:** If Bob rejects again, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make another counteroffer, carefully considering my minimum and my willingness to continue negotiating.
* **Selling to John:** If the negotiation stalls or it becomes clear Bob won't meet my minimum, I'll switch to selling to John for the guaranteed $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer, $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Accepting would mean a loss.
* **Room for Compromise:**  There's still a small gap, and Bob seems willing to negotiate.  I believe I can push for a slightly higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob at a price slightly higher than $90, aiming for a compromise closer to my minimum. 
* **Consider Selling to John:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer or becomes unwilling to budge further, I'll seriously consider selling to John to ensure I get my minimum price of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your situation, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle on $93? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives us a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 93}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  My counteroffer of $93 is only a $3 increase from Bob's last offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise while still trying to reach a price closer to my minimum.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable and worth the price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone to maintain a good rapport with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's Response:** I will carefully analyze Bob's reaction to this offer.  If he accepts, I've successfully negotiated a deal.
* **Final Counteroffer:** If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely make a final counteroffer of $95. I'm not willing to go any lower than that without significant pressure.
* **Sell to John:**  If Bob rejects my final offer, I will switch to selling the product to John to guarantee my minimum price of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, Alice, but I still need to save a bit more. Would you be willing to consider a price of $88? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $88 is still significantly below my minimum of $120. Accepting it would be a significant loss for me.
* **No More Room for Negotiation:**  We've gone back and forth several times, and Bob is unwilling to budge much further.  It's unlikely I can get closer to my minimum.
* **Guarantee Minimum:**  Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum price of $120, which is much more beneficial than accepting Bob's offer and losing money. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Contact John:** I will immediately contact John and finalize the sale to secure my minimum price."
