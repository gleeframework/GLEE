Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on $9000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $8500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum of $9,000.  I've made a few counteroffers, but we're not close to a deal.  I'm not confident I can get a higher price with more rounds of negotiation.  It's better to sell the product to John and secure the guaranteed $8,000."
