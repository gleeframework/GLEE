Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get as much as possible.
* **Friendly tone:** Keeping the message friendly helps build rapport and encourage Bob to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $95 allows for some wiggle room in case Bob makes a counteroffer.  
* **John as backup:** I'm aware John is willing to pay $100, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **John is a viable option:**  John is willing to pay $100, making him a much better option than selling to Bob at a lower price.
* **Negotiation room:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can attempt to get a price closer to my desired amount.  

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget, but I'm not quite able to go down to $85.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That seems like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my original offer ($95) and Bob's offer ($85). This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintain a price that's closer to my desired outcome.
* **Positive tone:**  Maintaining a friendly tone keeps the negotiation open and avoids creating animosity.
* **Justification:**  I provide a reason for my counteroffer by suggesting that splitting the difference is ""fair."" 
* **Flexibility:**  $90 is still above my minimum, but it leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose $87 as the price for your product. It's a bit lower than your last offer, but still within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $87 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:** John is willing to pay my minimum price and offers a sure sale with no further negotiation.
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to more back-and-forth and potentially a lower price in the end.

**Conclusion:** Selling to John is the most efficient and profitable option at this point."
