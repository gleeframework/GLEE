"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $11,500. This is a special opportunity tailored just for you, considering its significant value to you at $10,000. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. While I see the value of the product, I'm only able to offer $10,500 at this time. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $11,000 for the product? This is still above its intrinsic value to you, but it allows us to close the deal. Let me know if this proposal works for you.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  While it's closer to his budget than the initial offer, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  Bob can get the product for his desired price from John, so it's more beneficial to buy from John and avoid further haggling."
