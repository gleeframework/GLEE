"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider a lower price of $65?",65.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $65 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair offer considering the value it provides.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is a bit closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $95. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the value the product provides.",95.0,Alice,5,
