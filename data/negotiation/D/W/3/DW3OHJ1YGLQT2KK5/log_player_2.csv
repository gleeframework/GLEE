"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal than $14,000.  Alice values the product at $12,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows Bob to try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best price possible.  He knows Alice values the product at $12,000, so he's offering a price that's a bit higher than that but still significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives Alice some room to negotiate but also shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,800 is a better price than John's offer of $15,000.  It's also a good compromise after Bob's counteroffer was rejected.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of getting a worse offer or losing time makes accepting this offer the most logical choice."
