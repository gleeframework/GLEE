Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [Product Name] and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm asking for $200 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum to give myself room to negotiate. 
* **Personalization:**  I've mentioned a potential benefit to Bob to pique his interest.
* **Open ended:** I've left the message open for Bob to respond, encouraging a conversation. 

**Strategy:** This approach aims to start the negotiation strong, giving me the opportunity to see if Bob is truly interested and potentially negotiate a higher price. If he's not willing to pay my initial asking price, I'll adjust based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the [Product Name] but $200 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $150 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer more, accepting his offer is the most sensible choice:

* **No further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee a counteroffer will lead to a higher price. 
* **Time & effort:**  Continuing to negotiate will take time and effort.
* **Guaranteed sale:**  This secures a sale immediately, avoiding the risk of losing Bob or needing to sell to John."
