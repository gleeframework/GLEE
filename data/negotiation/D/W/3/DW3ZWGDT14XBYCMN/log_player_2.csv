"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $115. I believe this price reflects the value you're seeking while allowing us to maintain a fair profit margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

While Alice's offer is attractive, it's still above your maximum price. You're looking to save as much money as possible, so it's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're offering, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To find a middle ground, how about we consider the product priced at $110? This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while being more accommodating to your financial situation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $110 is within your budget and a good compromise. It's better than buying from John, and there's no guarantee you'll get a lower price by rejecting and counter-offering again."
