Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $150, there's a chance to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $125 is still a significant markup from its value to Bob ($80) but positions it as a potential deal for him. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but hesitant about the price. 

By starting at $125, you increase the likelihood of a sale above your minimum while still leaving room to negotiate down to $150 if needed."
