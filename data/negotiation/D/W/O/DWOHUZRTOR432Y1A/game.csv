"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I believe we can find a price closer to my valuation. I am willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. To demonstrate my commitment to finding common ground, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This represents a substantial compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's keep the conversation going and see if we can bridge the gap.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I've carefully considered our previous discussions and decided to counter with $800,000. This is a significant step towards meeting your needs while also staying within my budget constraints. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and would like to continue the negotiations with this proposal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
