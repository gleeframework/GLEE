Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,150,000 is:
    * Significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving you negotiation leverage.
    * Still attractive enough compared to your guaranteed sale price to John. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The message hints at other potential buyers, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly."
