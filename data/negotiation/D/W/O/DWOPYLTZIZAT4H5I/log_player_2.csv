"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really appreciate. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it to me for $110, which is still a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to get a better deal or buy it from John for $150.
