Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's an offer that aims to maximize your profit while considering Bob's valuation:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see great value in. Given its unique nature and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Bottom Line:** You won't sell for less than $1,200,000 (John's guaranteed offer).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's valuation maximizes your potential profit. Offering it at $1,450,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant gain for you. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** This offer sets the stage for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a slightly lower price to ensure a smoother deal. 
* **Market Information:**  While this scenario doesn't provide details about other potential buyers, in a real-world scenario, market demand could influence your pricing strategy."
