"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a valuable product that I believe would be highly beneficial for you. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial offer of $14,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's much closer to my maximum price than it is to her minimum. I should counter much lower and see how she responds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down in price, but not by much. It seems like she's willing to negotiate. I'll continue to counter-offer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm glad to see we're getting closer.  To be honest though, $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000 and call it a deal?"",
""product_price"": 12000
