Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer and the potential this product has. However, $1500000 is a bit higher than my initial budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1200000 for the product.  I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product while still allowing for a profitable return on investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
