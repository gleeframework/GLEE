"Alice, I appreciate your offer and the potential this product has. However, $1500000 is a bit higher than my initial budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1200000 for the product.  I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product while still allowing for a profitable return on investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
