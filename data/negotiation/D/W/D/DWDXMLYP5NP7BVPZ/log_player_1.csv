Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You absolutely won't sell below $1,500,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have John as a backup buyer at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, you're in a strong position.  You should aim high with Bob, knowing you have a safety net.  However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away immediately.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,800,000."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  This price is significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and your minimum.  This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value, justifying the high price. 

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob is likely to counter-offer. Be ready to negotiate down, but hold firm to a price above your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **John's Role:**  While you have John as a backup, avoid mentioning him. Revealing this information would weaken your negotiating position with Bob.
