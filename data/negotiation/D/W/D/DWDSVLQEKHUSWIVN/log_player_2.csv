Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're not going to see eye-to-eye, Bob. I'm not willing to go as low as $1075000. I'll make one more attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll counteroffer at $1125000. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm not willing to budge from this price. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.

Alice is clearly not willing to budge much further.  I've reached my limit for negotiating with her.

It's time to move on to John and finalize the deal."
