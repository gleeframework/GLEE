"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,100,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can do better.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,300,000. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a fair return on my investment.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already been through several rounds of negotiation and I'm not sure if I can get a higher price from Bob. Since John is also offering $1,200,000, I'll sell to him to avoid further negotiation and ensure a quick and certain sale."
