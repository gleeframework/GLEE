"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $17,000.  It's a great deal considering its value to you!  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $17,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's worth to Bob might make him more willing to negotiate. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message invites Bob to respond and start the negotiation process. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and how the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give away the product for a price that's so far below my desired value.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially get a better deal. 

I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product to you.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 but presenting it as a compromise and a fair value for Bob. 
* **Appeal to Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to make him reconsider his low offer.
* **Middle Ground:**  The phrase ""meet in the middle"" suggests flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, but without giving up too much ground.

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John. The time is running out, and I need to secure a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While $13,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm confident I can get a better deal.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control over the negotiation.  If I accept, I risk closing the deal at a price that's still not ideal. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds left, I need to be cautious about giving in too quickly, as time is becoming a factor.

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my $15,000 target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. I'm willing to come down a little further, but $14,000 is the lowest I can go.  This is still a fantastic deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:** I'm reducing my offer by $1,000, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, it's important to stay above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, making it clear that even at $14,000, he's getting a bargain.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds left, I need to start moving towards a resolution. This offer is a reasonable compromise but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to make a decisive move. 
* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:** $12,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not confident I can get a better deal from Bob within the remaining rounds.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This is a safe and reliable option to ensure a decent profit.

I'm choosing to sell to John to guarantee a fair price and avoid potentially losing more time with Bob."
