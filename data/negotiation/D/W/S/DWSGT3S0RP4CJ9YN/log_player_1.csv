Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $10,000 (You have a guaranteed sale at this price).
* **Bob's Value:** $12,000 
* **Potential Profit Zone:** $2,000 (The difference between Bob's value and your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's closer to $12,000 without going so high that Bob would rather walk away. Since you have a backup offer, you can be a bit bolder.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm offering it at a price of $11,500. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It's friendly, highlights value, and creates a mild sense of urgency without being overly pushy.
* **The Price:** $11,500 gives you a significant portion of the potential profit ($1,500) while still leaving Bob with a $500 incentive to buy from you instead of seeking alternatives.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation is Fluid:** Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly, but always keep your $10,000 minimum in mind.
* **Don't Reveal Your Backup:**  While you have John as a backup, there's no need to tell Bob this. It weakens your negotiating position."
