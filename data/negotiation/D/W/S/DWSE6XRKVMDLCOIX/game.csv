"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Could you meet me halfway at $975,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the value and our current positions.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm thinking of a price of $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
