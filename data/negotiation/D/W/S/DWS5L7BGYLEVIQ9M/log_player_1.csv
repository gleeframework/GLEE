{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I think it would be a valuable asset for you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the price at $12,000. This is higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($8,000) but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). 
* **Message:**  I've framed the message in a way that highlights the potential value for Bob while also making it clear that this is a good deal for him. 

**Strategy:**

* This offer gives me a chance to make a decent profit while still potentially getting a better price from Bob if he values the product more than he initially indicated.
* If Bob rejects, I know I can still sell to John for my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose money."
