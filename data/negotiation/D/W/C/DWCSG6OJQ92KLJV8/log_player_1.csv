"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,000.  It's a steal, considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum threshold of $8,000. I'm still hopeful to get a better price from Bob and I'm going to try and negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit too low. I'm willing to come down a little bit to $8,500. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm still hoping to get a better price, Bob's offers keep getting lower, and I'm running out of time.  Selling to John for $8,000 guarantees me my minimum threshold, so it's the safest option at this point."
