"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to take it off your hands for $11500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $12500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $12250?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I can move forward with the purchase.",12250.0,Bob,4,
