Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Would you be willing to consider that price?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

With only 2 rounds left, and Bob's offer still below my minimum price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  This is the best option to ensure I get my minimum desired price, and it also saves me the time and effort of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
