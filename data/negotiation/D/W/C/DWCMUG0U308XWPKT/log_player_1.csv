Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still ensuring a profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still keeping the price significantly above my minimum.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost."
