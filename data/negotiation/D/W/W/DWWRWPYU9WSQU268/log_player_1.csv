Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm setting the price at $19,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is not realistic:** In a real-world negotiation, you wouldn't know Bob's maximum willingness to pay ($8,000). 
* **Starting high:** It's generally a good strategy to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This allows room for negotiation and potentially lets you secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price (value and interest) makes it seem less arbitrary. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the message starts high, the phrase ""What do you think?"" suggests openness to discussion.

**Important:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, since we have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 (John), it's worth aiming high initially."
