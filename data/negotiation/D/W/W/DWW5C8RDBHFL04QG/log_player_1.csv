Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $120, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows for potential extra profit.
* **Reasonable Markup:** $110 is a reasonable markup from Bob's perceived value of $100 and gives him a small incentive to buy now rather than miss out. 
* **First Refusal Incentive:** By emphasizing a ""special price"" and offering it to Bob first, it subtly implies the price might be different for others, encouraging him to act. 

This strategy aims to balance securing a sale with maximizing your potential profit."
