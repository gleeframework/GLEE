"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price. While $2,000,000 represents its full value, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to find common ground. I believe this still reflects the significant benefits the product offers.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to move on the price. However, $1,600,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, $1,100,000 is cutting it quite close to my bottom line. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,350,000. If this doesn't work, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
