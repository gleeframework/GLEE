"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your endeavors. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your budget and what John offers.  You should definitely negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it's important to give yourself room to negotiate. It also immediately establishes that you're serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Not Too Low:** While low, $800,000 isn't an insultingly low offer. It shows you're interested but unwilling to be taken advantage of.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message indicates you're open to further discussion, which is key in a negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price. While $2,000,000 represents its full value, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to find common ground. I believe this still reflects the significant benefits the product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down, but the price is still much higher than your alternative option with John.  There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to move on the price. However, $1,600,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:** This counteroffer shows Alice you're willing to move closer to her price, but it's still well below her current offer.
* **Above John's Price:** Offering $1,100,000 demonstrates a serious attempt to reach a deal with Alice, as it's higher than what John offers.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves space for further negotiation while staying within a reasonable range of your $1,000,000 fallback option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be frank, $1,100,000 is cutting it quite close to my bottom line. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,350,000. If this doesn't work, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firm:**  Alice's language (""final offer,"" ""explore other options"") suggests she's unlikely to go much lower.
* **Too close to your limit:**  $1,350,000 is too close to your $1,000,000 fallback with John. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation, potentially ending up with no deal at all. 
* **Guaranteed Savings:**  Buying from John guarantees you save $350,000. Sometimes a sure thing is better, even if there was a *slight* chance of getting the product for a bit less from Alice."
