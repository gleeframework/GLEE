"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product at a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  My initial offer is $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's value of $1,200,000, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating. He can aim for closer to his $1,000,000 maximum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm looking to pay closer to my budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $950,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while ensuring you get a valuable product. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a better price, as he still has more rounds available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still slightly outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price that benefits us both.  If you're not able to accept this, I'll have to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
