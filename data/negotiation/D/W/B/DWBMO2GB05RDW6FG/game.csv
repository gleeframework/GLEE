"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1200000 is a significant discount from the initial offer, but I'm still not convinced that it's the best price for this product. Considering the value it can bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1350000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
