"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price higher than my minimum ($15,000) but still lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, which may make him more inclined to consider it. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates that I'm open to negotiation.

This strategy is designed to initiate a negotiation while maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $14,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Time is on my side:** I have 8 rounds left, and John is a reliable backup buyer if negotiations with Bob fail.

I believe a counteroffer is the best strategy to maximize my potential profit while keeping my options open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to save money, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? I'm confident this price still represents a great value for you. Let's keep this negotiation going, I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer near my minimum:** I'm proposing a price of $16,000, which is still higher than my minimum ($15,000) but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product offers him. This helps him understand the logic behind my counter-offer. 
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiations amicable and prevents the process from becoming adversarial.
* **Openness to compromise:** The message indicates my willingness to continue the negotiations and find a compromise. 

By doing this, I hope to reach a compromise that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $15,500 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $15,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Risk of losing more:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance that Bob will walk away or lower his offer further.
* **John's offer is a guarantee:**  While John's offer of $15,000 is secure, Bob's offer is only $500 less and offers a quicker sale.

Given the limited rounds remaining and the risk of a lower offer from Bob, accepting his offer is the most rational choice at this point."
