"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for a product of this quality.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for countering, Alice. While I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, $14,000 is still a bit high for me. Could you consider $11,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this sale. How about we try $12,500? That's as low as I can go.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still hoping to land closer to $11,000.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much money. How about we try $13,000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",13000.0,Alice,7,
