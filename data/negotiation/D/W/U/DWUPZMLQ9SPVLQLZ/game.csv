"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $8,200. It's a great price, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, I'm still finding $8,200 a little high for me. Would you be open to $7,000? I think that's a fair price that works for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $7,800. It's a great price, and I think you'll really get a lot of value out of this product. What do you think?",7800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting close to my limit. I could do $7,200, but that's absolutely the highest I can go.  Let me know what you think.",7200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting close to your limit, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling it to you for $7,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,200 and my original offer. How about $8,100? It's a fair price, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. What do you think?",8100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're hitting a wall here. I can't justify going any higher than $7,400.  If that's not workable, I might have to explore other options.",7400.0,Bob,8,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $7,500. It's a great price, and I think you'll really get a lot of value out of this product. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,9,
