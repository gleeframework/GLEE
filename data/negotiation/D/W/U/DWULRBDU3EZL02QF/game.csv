"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,750,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,500,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,600,000? This gives us both room to compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,600,000 is still a little steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go below $1,500,000. This is my bottom line.  I understand we're not quite there yet, but I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
