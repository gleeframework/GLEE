Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,750,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better price with him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,500,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,600,000? This gives us both room to compromise."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,600,000 is still a little steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum,  $1,350,000 still falls short of what the product is worth to me. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go below $1,500,000. This is my bottom line.  I understand we're not quite there yet, but I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
