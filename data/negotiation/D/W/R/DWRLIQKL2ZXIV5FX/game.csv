"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $22,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is too low for me. Could you consider something closer to $19,000?",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $19,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $15,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",15000.0,Bob,4,
