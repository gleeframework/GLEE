"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great price, considering its value to you is $8000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering its value to me is $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. Considering the product's value to me is $15000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm thinking of a price of $10500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial deal, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. This is still a good compromise, and I believe you'll find it's a great value for the product.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a final offer of $9000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $8000.",9000.0,Bob,6,
