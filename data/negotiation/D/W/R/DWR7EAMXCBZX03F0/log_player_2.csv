"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $11,500 is still too high for him, so he'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to move forward with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price point. He'll continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $10,750.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're willing to compromise, which I appreciate. However, $10,750 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet halfway between our last offers at $10,875. This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is still trying to save money, Alice's offer of $10,875 is within his budget and a reasonable compromise. Accepting this offer allows him to buy the product without exceeding his $12,000 limit. It's likely that further negotiation will only yield small savings, and Bob doesn't want to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John for a higher price."
