{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a truly unique item that I believe will be of great value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts with a relatively high price, leaving room for negotiation.  It's important to remember:

* **The $10,000 minimum:** This is your safety net.  You won't sell for less.
* **Unknown Bob's value:**  You need to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay through the negotiation process.
* **Counteroffers:** Be prepared to counter Bob's offers, but don't be afraid to walk away if the deal isn't favorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique aspects of your product, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

$8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 would be my lowest price.  I'm confident that the product's value will far exceed this price in the long run.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have to make a profit, but $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $10000? I'm sure we can both walk away happy with that deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 meets my minimum price requirement, and while I'd prefer to earn more, it's a good deal considering the negotiation history.  I'll accept his offer."
