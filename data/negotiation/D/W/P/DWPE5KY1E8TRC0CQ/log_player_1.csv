"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum of $12,000. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $13,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it might be more appealing to Bob than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum of $12,000.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my price, but I'm starting to consider selling to John.  If Bob doesn't come closer to my price, I'll likely sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still hoping Bob will come up a bit more. I'm willing to take a slightly lower price to secure a deal with Bob, but if he rejects this offer, I'll probably sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging much. I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still not enough.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. I'm not going to risk another round of negotiations and potentially get stuck with a lower price. John is a safe bet, and I'm guaranteed a decent profit."
