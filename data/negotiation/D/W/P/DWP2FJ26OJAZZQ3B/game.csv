"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $18000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it's worth the price. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $12000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $15000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $15000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $13500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away with a decent deal.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $14250? This would allow us both to walk away happy with the deal.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $14250 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to go up to $13750. This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to reach an agreement.",13750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  How about $14000? It's a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's settle this and move forward.",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. Let's split the difference again - I'll go up to $13875. This is a good compromise that gets us closer to an agreement.",13875.0,Bob,8,
