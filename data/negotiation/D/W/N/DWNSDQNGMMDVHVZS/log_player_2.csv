"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget.  It's worth exploring if you can negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the information about the product's uniqueness. While I'm interested,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within your budget.  This shows a willingness to negotiate and sets a lower benchmark for future rounds. 
* **Justification:** The message acknowledges Alice's points but emphasizes your budget limitations. This makes the counteroffer seem less arbitrary. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends by inviting further discussion, leaving room for compromise in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $750000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $750,000 is still a significant sum.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get closer to your initial counteroffer of $600,000.  There's still room for compromise, and you have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $750,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $700,000? I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** This counteroffer represents a small increase from your previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise while staying within your budget.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  The message emphasizes ""fairness"" to appeal to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Specific Justification:**  It's not just a random number; it's a clear middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's current one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $725000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $725,000 is now very close to your last counteroffer of $700,000. While you could continue negotiating, there's a good chance you'll reach a stalemate, and you have limited rounds.  Accepting her offer is a good way to secure a deal within your budget and avoid the risk of having to buy from John at a much higher price."
