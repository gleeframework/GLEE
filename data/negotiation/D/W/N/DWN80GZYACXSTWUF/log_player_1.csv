"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $10,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $12,500? That's a fair compromise, and it still leaves some room for both of us to be happy."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $12,500 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $9,000? That's the most I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm starting to feel the pressure, $9,000 is still too far below my minimum price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 simply doesn't work for me. It's still quite a bit below what I need to get for this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This feels like a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away feeling like we got a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,500? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm getting close to my minimum, I still feel like I can push for a slightly higher price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet at $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us finalize this deal.  It's the last offer I can make, I'm really not comfortable going lower."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $9,750. That's the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm close to my minimum price, Bob's final offer of $9,750 is still below what I'd like to get.  I've already made several compromises and it seems like we're at an impasse.  Rather than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risk getting nothing, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. It's the best outcome for me at this point."
