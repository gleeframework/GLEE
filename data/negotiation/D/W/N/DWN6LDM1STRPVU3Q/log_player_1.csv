"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000.  This is well above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and is still less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  My goal is to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play the negotiation game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a significant improvement from Bob's initial value of $800,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal, especially considering the limited rounds.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm dropping the price from my initial offer to $1,300,000.  This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and it demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate.  It's also a good middle ground, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This should make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is slightly higher than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I believe I can still negotiate a better price, especially with several rounds remaining. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my target.  The risk of selling to John for $1,200,000 is always present, but I want to exhaust all negotiation possibilities with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a significant drop from my previous counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. It's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it's closer to Bob's perceived value, which could make him more inclined to accept. I'm aiming to find the sweet spot where we can both feel comfortable with the deal.  With fewer rounds left, I need to strike a balance between pushing for a better price and securing a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still $220,000 lower. With only four rounds left, I'm willing to take a risk and see if I can negotiate a better deal.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to entice Bob to finally accept.  The risk of selling to John is increasing, but I believe I can secure a deal closer to my desired price if I continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a significant move closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  With only three rounds remaining, I'm taking a calculated risk.  This offer shows Bob that I'm serious about closing a deal with him, while still allowing me to secure a profit. If this offer fails, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is becoming too high.  While Bob's offer is only $10,000 away from my minimum acceptable price, I'm no longer confident I can secure a better deal within the remaining rounds.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me a profit, and I'm willing to accept this outcome to avoid the potential loss of a sale."
