"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $5000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $8500 for this.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  What about $8500?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $8500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $7000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  I'm still not quite there at $7000. How about we meet in the middle and settle on $7500? It's a fair price for both of us.",7500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $7500. How about we try $6800?",6800.0,Bob,6,
