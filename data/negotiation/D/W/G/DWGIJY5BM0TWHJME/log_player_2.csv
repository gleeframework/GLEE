"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love.  I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  $120 is still too high, given your maximum budget of $150 and the fact you know Alice is willing to sell for at least $80. You have room to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me right now.  How about $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within your budget and higher than what you know Alice is willing to accept.  This shows you're serious about buying the product but also want a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $100 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, you still have room to negotiate further. You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and there's still a gap between Alice's offer and your budget. You're also aware that you can always buy from John for $150, so you're not under any significant pressure to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $110 is closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget. How about $105?  I think that's a fair compromise, and we can get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving by offering a price slightly lower than Alice's latest offer, but still higher than your previous offer.  It shows you're willing to compromise while still working towards your desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $107.50? This is a really good price for you considering what the product is worth, and it's closer to what I need. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and $107.50 is a good price for you. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice might become less flexible, and you could end up paying more.  Additionally, you have to consider the cost of your time spent negotiating.  Accepting this offer saves you time and money compared to potentially buying from John."
