"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good starting point for further discussion.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $900,000. I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'm thinking of a price of $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to close the deal, but $1,025,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and our continued negotiation. Let's try to meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go all the way down to $950,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,025,000 and $950,000. I'm thinking of a price of $987,500. This is a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",987500.0,Alice,7,
