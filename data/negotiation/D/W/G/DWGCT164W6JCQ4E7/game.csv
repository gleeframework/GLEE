"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still offers you a significant saving compared to my original price, and it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
