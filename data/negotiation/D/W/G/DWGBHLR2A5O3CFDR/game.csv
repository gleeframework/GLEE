"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18,000 is below the product's true value. I can come down to $20,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.",20000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While I value your interest, I can't go as low as $17,500. My final offer is $19,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my willingness to make a deal.",19000.0,Alice,5,
