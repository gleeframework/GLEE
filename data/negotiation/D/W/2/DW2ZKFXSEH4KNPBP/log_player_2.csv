# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $9,500.  This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's below its market value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
