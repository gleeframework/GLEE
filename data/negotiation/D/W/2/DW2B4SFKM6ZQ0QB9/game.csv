"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm offering you the product for $950,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. $950,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a substantial amount for me. Let's see if we can find a common ground at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
