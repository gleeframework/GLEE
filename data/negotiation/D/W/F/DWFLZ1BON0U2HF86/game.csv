"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's start our negotiation with this offer.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you presenting your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However,  $1,100,000 is quite a distance from what I had in mind. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,450,000. This price reflects the true worth of this product and its potential benefits for your business.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me.  To meet halfway, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  This price acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
