"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I think it would be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the potential benefits of the product for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting a bit high, I leave space for Bob to counteroffer without making me feel like I'm being unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I think it's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Time is on my side:**  With 8 rounds remaining, I have time to explore other options without rushing into a deal that undervalues my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? This would give us both a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm suggesting a price that's midway between my initial offer and his, which signals fairness and compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing a ""fair deal"" for both of us, making the offer more appealing.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm refraining from lowering the price too dramatically, as I still want to ensure I get a reasonable price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet halfway from $9000 to $10500? I'm thinking $9750 would be a fair price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time for a final counteroffer:**  I've shown flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, but I need to hold firm on my price.  I'll make one final counteroffer, but if it's rejected, I'll move on to selling to John.
* **Strategic Decision:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I can't afford to keep making concessions.  My priority is to get as close to my target price as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  This is my final offer - $10,000.  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, and I'm willing to close the deal at this point.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counteroffer:**  This is my last chance to negotiate with Bob. I'm making a final, firm counteroffer. 
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price slightly closer to Bob's last offer but still within my acceptable range.
* **Clear Decision:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, leaving Bob with a clear choice.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm expressing a willingness to close the deal at this price, emphasizing urgency and a commitment to concluding the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to close the deal, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet John's price of $10000? I'm willing to pay that, but I think it's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the target:** Bob has finally agreed to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Time is running out:** With only four rounds remaining, there's a high risk that I'll lose a better deal with John if I continue to negotiate.  
* **Securing the sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale at my minimum acceptable price, maximizing my profit.  

While I'd prefer to sell to John for $15,000, accepting this offer guarantees me a sale at a price that meets my minimum expectations.  It's a good outcome given the time constraints and the risk of losing the deal with John."
