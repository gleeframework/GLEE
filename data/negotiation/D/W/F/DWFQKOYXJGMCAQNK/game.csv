"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,150,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I can afford, I still need to stick to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this proposal is within your consideration.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
