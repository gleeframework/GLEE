"I'm very interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. Can you consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $900,000 is below what I had in mind, I understand the need to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the true value of the product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is the right price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,150,000, which is $1,025,000. Can you consider this price?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to accept $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain from the product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider this price?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
