Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway, considering the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I think I can still push for a better deal. I'm confident that Bob values the product enough to come up a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with a price of $950,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to move closer to his offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I hope this will be enough to entice Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to $950,000, the negotiation seems to be stalling.  At $920,000, I'm still significantly exceeding my minimum price and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to push for a higher price."
