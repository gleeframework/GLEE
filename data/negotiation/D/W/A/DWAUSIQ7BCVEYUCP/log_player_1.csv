{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's value:**  Giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  Leaving you room for potential counteroffers.
* **It's a reasonable price:**  Giving Bob a good reason to seriously consider the deal.

By offering this price, you open the negotiation in a way that benefits you while also leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price.  It's better to reject his offer and see if you can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $1,200,000? This seems like a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is your minimum acceptable price. While it's not ideal to sell for the minimum, it's better than risking further negotiation with Bob, which could lead to a lower offer, or selling to John at $1,500,000.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale at your minimum, guaranteeing a profit."
