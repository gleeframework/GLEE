"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
You can do better than $120, so rejecting the offer is the best course of action for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested, but I'd need to see it closer to $100.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
Alice has come down to $110, which is a good price for you. There's a chance you might get it for less, but you could also risk losing the deal.  $110 is still within your budget and a good compromise."
