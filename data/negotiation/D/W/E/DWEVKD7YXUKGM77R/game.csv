"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. Given the product's worth to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value you see, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
