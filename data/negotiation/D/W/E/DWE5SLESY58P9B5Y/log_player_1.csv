"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is better than his initial rejection, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  Selling to John at this point would guarantee my minimum, but I want to explore if I can do better with Bob."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
