Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **Higher than your minimum:**  $1,400,000 is still higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Attractive to Bob:**  $1,400,000 is significantly less than the $1,500,000 value Bob places on the product, giving him a good potential profit.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  If Bob balks at $1,400,000, you have room to negotiate slightly, potentially reaching a price closer to your ideal.

This offer maximizes your chances of getting a higher price than John's offer while still being attractive enough to Bob."
