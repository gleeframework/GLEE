{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $80. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly lower than my minimum value ($120) but still leaves room for negotiation.  This also allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob without me immediately having to fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay $95. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a good deal for you, as you know it's worth $80. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product and would like to propose $100 as my maximum offer. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $100 is still below my minimum value, it's getting closer.  It's likely that Bob won't go any higher, and I don't want to risk losing him completely.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
