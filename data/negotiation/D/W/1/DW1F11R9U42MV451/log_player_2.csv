{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my needs.  However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has negotiated the price down significantly from Alice's initial offer of $9,500. While he would prefer to pay less, this offer is within his budget and closer to his goal of $8,000.  He's likely to accept this offer before it goes up again or he ends up buying from John for a higher price."
