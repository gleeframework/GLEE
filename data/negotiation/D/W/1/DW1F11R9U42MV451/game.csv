"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my needs.  However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to spend at this time.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,750?  It's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
