Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below my minimum acceptable price ($120) creates a sense of urgency and makes it more enticing for Bob.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, this price still leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly interested.

Even if Bob rejects this offer, I'm still securing my minimum price with John."
