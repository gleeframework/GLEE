"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit high for me at this point. I'm willing to offer $950,000, considering the product's value to you and my budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $950,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a considerable return on investment.  What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given the product's value to you, I believe a price of $1,050,000 is fair and allows for a healthy profit for you.  I'm confident this is a price we can both agree on.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
