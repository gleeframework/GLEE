{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}

This offer starts at a price higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation if needed. It's important to establish a friendly tone and express belief in the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $90 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum value. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to come down a little. How about we split the difference at $95?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is above my minimum of $80 and I'm not sure how much more I can get from him. It's better to accept the offer and move on."
