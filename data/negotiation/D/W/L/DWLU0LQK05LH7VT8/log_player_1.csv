Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering the product for $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but still a good profit for me. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the value proposition for Bob. This might make him more likely to accept the offer.

**Strategy:** 

I'm starting with a relatively high price, knowing that I have a backup option with John. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my $12,000 target by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,750?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm raising the price slightly to $9,750. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still trying to maximize my profit.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating my appreciation for Bob's offer and framing this counteroffer as a fair solution for both of us. This might help convince him to accept.

**Strategy:** 

I'm aiming for a middle ground, hoping to meet Bob halfway and secure a price closer to my desired amount. This keeps the negotiation going while staying within a reasonable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I believe I can still save more by purchasing from another source. I would like to stick to my original budget of $8,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I've already made several concessions, and it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. Given that John is willing to pay my minimum price, it makes more sense to sell the product to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
