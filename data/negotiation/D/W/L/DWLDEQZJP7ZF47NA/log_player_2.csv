"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $16,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth at least $15,000 to you. If you're not interested, I'm confident I can sell it to someone else for that price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget and above John's offer. You can definitely get a better price by either negotiating with Alice or going with John."
