"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. This price would be fair to both of us, as it's significantly lower than my maximum budget and still leaves you with a good profit. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $750,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This price takes into account your budget constraints while still allowing me to get a fair deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
