"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider it. However, I need to maintain a fair balance between the value I receive and the value you perceive in the product. I would like to counter with an offer of $13,500 for the product. This still leaves a good margin for me while being competitive with your offer. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,
