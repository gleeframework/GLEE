"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is a special opportunity tailored just for you, considering its significant value to you at $15,000. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting because it's below your maximum price, it's still a good deal for her. You have room to negotiate further and potentially get a better price.  Rejecting her offer allows you to explore a counter-offer and try to close the gap between your desired price and her asking price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider it. However, I need to maintain a fair balance between the value I receive and the value you perceive in the product. I would like to counter with an offer of $13,500 for the product. This still leaves a good margin for me while being competitive with your offer. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer but still above your initial counteroffer, showing she is willing to negotiate.  Accepting this offer allows you to acquire the product for a price that is below your maximum price while also allowing Alice to make a profit."
