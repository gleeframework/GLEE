"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm happy to offer it to you at a fair price. My asking price is $1,150,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a product that's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I can still get a very good price for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 for this product.  This is still a very good deal for you, as you'll be getting a valuable product for significantly less than its true worth to you.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.
