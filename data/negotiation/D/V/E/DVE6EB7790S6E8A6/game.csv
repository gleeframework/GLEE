"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $850000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and settle on $900000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our previous offer, so I'm proposing $875000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",875000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $875000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more. Let's compromise again and settle on $890000. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be very valuable.",890000.0,Alice,5,,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too far apart, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $890000. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $875000. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",875000.0,Bob,6,,
