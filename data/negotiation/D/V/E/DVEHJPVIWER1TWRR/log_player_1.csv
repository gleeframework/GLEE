"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that's significantly higher than my minimum value, while still leaving room for negotiation.  It also frames the product in a positive light, highlighting its potential value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, say around $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested!  $90 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105. Let's meet in the middle, I think we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $90 is low, Alice. How about we split the difference and meet at $97.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$97.50 is a good price. It's higher than selling to John and getting closer to my desired value. I'm happy to close the deal at this point."
