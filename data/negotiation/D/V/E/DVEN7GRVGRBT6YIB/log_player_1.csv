"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum value of $80. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm accepting Bob's offer. $90 is a good price, considering my minimum value of $80 and the fact that we're only on round 2.  It's likely that further negotiation might get me closer to my initial asking price, but there's no guarantee and I could risk losing the sale altogether."
