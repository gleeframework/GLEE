"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $100.  This is a good deal, but I can try to get a better price.  I'll reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $90. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $100, but still within my budget.  I'm hoping Alice will see the value in closing the deal quickly and accept my offer."
