"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this price reflects its value and allows for a good profit margin for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price that's significantly higher than my minimum ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. This establishes a strong initial position and allows for flexibility. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm framing the offer in terms of value for Bob. This helps him see the benefit of buying at this price. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm inviting a response, making it clear that I'm open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $950,000. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  While $850,000 is still above my minimum, it's significantly lower than my initial offer and doesn't reflect the true value of the product to Bob.
* **Negotiation Room:** I want to explore further negotiation with Bob. There's still room to reach a mutually beneficial price closer to my desired value.
* **Holding Out:**  Selling to John now would secure a decent profit, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to potentially get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value, but $850,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but not completely shutting down the negotiation. This shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Middle Ground:**  $900,000 represents a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This makes it easier for Bob to see a path to agreement.
* **Value Justification:** I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value to him, emphasizing the potential for a strong return on investment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $875,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While $875,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth to Bob.  I'm hoping to push for a higher price.
* **Time is on My Side:** We're still early in the negotiation process. I have 6 more rounds to try to get a better deal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John would secure a decent profit, but I'm willing to take the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $875,000 is still too low for me. Given the potential value of this product to your business, I'm willing to meet you at $890,000. This is a final offer from my side. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm framing this as my final offer to create a sense of urgency and pressure on Bob. This could motivate him to accept.
* **Small Compromise:** I'm only slightly increasing my offer from the previous round, indicating a genuine effort to reach an agreement.
* **Value Reminder:** I'm again highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob to strengthen my position.
* **Clear Decision Point:**  This puts the ball in Bob's court and forces him to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're not willing to go any lower, but I'm still not comfortable with $890,000. I'm willing to pay $880,000, which is the highest I can go. Please consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on the Deal:**  Bob's offer of $880,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation process. There's a risk that if I reject this offer, Bob may walk away, and I'll be left with only John as a buyer.
* **Profitable Outcome:**  While I would have preferred a higher price, $880,000 still represents a substantial profit for me.  It's a good outcome considering the risk of a potential breakdown in negotiations."
