Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you're interested in. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  A high initial offer helps you understand how serious Bob is about the product. If he outright rejects it, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with John."
