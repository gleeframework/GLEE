"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,000. It's still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $10,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you be willing to consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $9,000. It's still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,5,
