"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market value. However, the product's intrinsic worth and potential benefits warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your point about the product's value, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'd like to meet you in the middle at $1,650,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while also being reasonable for me.",1650000.0,Bob,4,
