"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $9,000 is still significantly lower than what I'm looking for. How about we compromise at $10,500? This leaves some room for negotiation but gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,000. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're close, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",9500.0,Bob,6,
