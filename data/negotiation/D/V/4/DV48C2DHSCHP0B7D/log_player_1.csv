Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering a price slightly lower than the product's worth to me ($120) but still above my minimum value ($80).
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to consider the offer and potentially negotiate further.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This price leaves room for negotiation, allowing Bob to make a counteroffer if he wants to pay less. 

If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter his offer or move on to John if it's not worthwhile."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:**  $90 is only $10 below my ideal price and $10 above my minimum.
* **Moving on is risky:**  There's no guarantee John will be available, and continuing negotiations with Bob might yield a better result.
* **Time is money:**  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and avoids further negotiations that might drag on."
