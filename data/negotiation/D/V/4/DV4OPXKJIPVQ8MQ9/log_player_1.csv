Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $20000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$7,500 is significantly less than my minimum value of $15,000. I will reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $17,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $17500 is still too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's well within your original asking price and allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired outcome. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,000 is simply not enough for me to part with this valuable product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,750. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility.  However, $13750 is still outside my budget.  As I mentioned before, $10000 is the absolute limit I can reach.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hopeful you'll reconsider.  If not, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge from his $10,000 offer, and while it's tempting to keep negotiating, I've already reached a point where I'm risking losing too much time and potentially ending up with a sale far below my desired minimum.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
