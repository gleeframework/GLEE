"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can proceed to buy from John and save $100,000. 
* While Alice mentions another buyer, there's no guarantee they exist or will pay full price. Your priority is getting the best deal."
