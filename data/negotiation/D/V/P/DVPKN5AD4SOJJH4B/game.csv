"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $11,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",11800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $11,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering we both want to make this deal happen.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $12,100. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to you.",12100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be fair here, but $12,100 is simply too high. I'm sticking with my offer of $11,000.  It's a reasonable price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both parties.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm not willing to give up on the value of this product. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $11,500 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can reach an agreement at $11,250.  This is a fair compromise that will benefit both of us.  Let's try to make this deal work.",11250.0,Bob,8,

This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",11750.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, we're almost there. I'm going to stick with my last offer of $11,250.  It's a fair price, and if you want to make this deal happen, this is the price we need to agree on.  If we can't find a compromise, I'm going to have to go with another seller.",11250.0,Bob,10,
