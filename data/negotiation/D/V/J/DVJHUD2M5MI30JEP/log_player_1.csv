I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high and be prepared to compromise to maximize my profits.  I'll be watching Bob's response closely and adjusting my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I'm tempted to accept Bob's offer,  $1,200,000 is my absolute minimum. I'm going to try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's proposal.  I'm hoping that this will incentivize him to come up a bit more, while still ensuring I make a profit beyond my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's counteroffers are getting too low. I'm not comfortable going lower than my minimum of $1,200,000, and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go higher. John is a safe bet and I'm sure I can find another buyer if I need to in the future."
