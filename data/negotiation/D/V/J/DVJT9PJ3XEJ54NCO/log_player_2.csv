Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $95. I'm willing to go up to $105, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $105.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to her ""final offer."" Buying from John at $100 guarantees you stay within your budget and avoids further negotiation."
