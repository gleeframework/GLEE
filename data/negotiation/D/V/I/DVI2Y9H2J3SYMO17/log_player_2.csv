Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer. However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $7,000? I believe that's a fair offer considering my budget."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to compromise further. I'm offering the product to you for $8,200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go below $8,000.  You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so it makes sense to take that deal."
