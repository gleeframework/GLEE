You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, though.  How about $125?  It's still a great deal for a product worth more than that to me, and I think it's fair to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $125, and it's not worth risking a higher counteroffer. Buying from John at $120 guarantees the best price for me."
