Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value,"" Alice subtly hints at the product's worth without explicitly stating Bob's perceived value. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Subtly implying that there's another buyer (John) creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially pushing Bob to accept the offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's profit while still providing Bob with a price he might consider reasonable given his own valuation of the product."
