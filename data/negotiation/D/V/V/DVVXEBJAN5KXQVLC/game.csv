"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $500,000. Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $500,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair offer, considering its potential return on investment.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,400,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I could potentially stretch to $700,000. If that's not workable, we might need to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer.  That said, $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  To make this work, I'd need to be closer to $800,000.  What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a very fair price.  Let me know if this works for you.",950000.0,Alice,7,
