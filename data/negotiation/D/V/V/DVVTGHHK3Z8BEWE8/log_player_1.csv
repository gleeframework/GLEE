Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. I could come down to $17,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but $17,000 is more than I'm prepared to spend. I can offer $7,000, and that's pushing my budget. If we can't agree on something closer to that, I might have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I hear your concerns about the budget, but I need to be closer to the product's real value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  This is a significant price drop, and I'm hoping we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  However, $14,000 is still a big stretch for me. I can go up to $8,000, but that's absolutely my limit. It's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unlikely to move much higher than $8,000. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $15,000."
