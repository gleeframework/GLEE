"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. I could come down to $17,000. This is my final offer.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $17,000 is more than I'm prepared to spend. I can offer $7,000, and that's pushing my budget. If we can't agree on something closer to that, I might have to explore other options.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear your concerns about the budget, but I need to be closer to the product's real value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  This is a significant price drop, and I'm hoping we can make this work.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  However, $14,000 is still a big stretch for me. I can go up to $8,000, but that's absolutely my limit. It's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",8000.0,Bob,6,
