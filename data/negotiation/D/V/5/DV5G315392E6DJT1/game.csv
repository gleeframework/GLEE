"Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you.  It's something I've been holding onto for a while, and I know it's worth at least $12,000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500.  This is a great opportunity to get something you really want at a fair price. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,1,
