"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the market value and what I'm willing to pay.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced that it's worth $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,500, which is $10,500. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay.",10500.0,Bob,4,
