"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I recognize its value, $20,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? ",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $17,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you're definitely getting closer! I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $12,000 is too low for me.  Could you do $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,5,
