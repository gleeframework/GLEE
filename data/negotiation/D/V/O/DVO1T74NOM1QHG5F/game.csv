"Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $9000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7500? I think it's a fair price considering the value you're offering.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $7500 is tempting, I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $8500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $8500 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7000? I think it's a fair price considering the value you're offering, and I'm willing to make a decision soon.",7000.0,Bob,4,
