Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's also a good starting point considering the product is worth at least $120 to me.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $130 is better than selling to John, I think I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to try to negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $140.  It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will be acceptable to Bob, and I can avoid having to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $135.  While I'd prefer a bit more, it's a decent price, and it avoids having to sell to John for $120.  This is a good compromise that ensures I get a reasonable profit."
