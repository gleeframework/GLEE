{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but significantly lower than my minimum value ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring a good profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build a positive rapport with Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This price allows for potential counteroffers from Bob, giving us the chance to find a price that's mutually agreeable.
* **Backup Plan:** I'm keeping John as a backup buyer, ensuring that I can sell the product for my minimum value if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $12,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I believe there's room for negotiation. Bob acknowledges the value of the product, indicating a willingness to pay more.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price. 

I will proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer, aiming to secure a price closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I understand your budget, I can't go as low as $12,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  This would still be a great value for you and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000). This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Profit Margin:**  The price of $13,500 is still above my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Positive & Encouraging Tone:**  The message remains friendly and encourages Bob to consider my counteroffer. 

This counteroffer gives Bob a reasonable price point to consider while still allowing me to potentially secure a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've reviewed my budget again and am still unable to exceed $12,000 for this product. I believe we might not be able to reach an agreement here. However, if you're willing to lower your price to $12,000, I'd be happy to purchase the product from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Stance is Firm:** Bob has reiterated his maximum price of $12,000.  
* **No Room for Further Negotiation:**  It's unlikely that further negotiation will yield a better result.  
* **John Offers a Better Deal:**  Selling to John guarantees a profit of $15,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer.

It's more advantageous to sell to John and secure the guaranteed profit of $15,000."
