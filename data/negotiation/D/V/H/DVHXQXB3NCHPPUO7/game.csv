"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I understand your budget, I can't go as low as $12,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  This would still be a great value for you and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I've reviewed my budget again and am still unable to exceed $12,000 for this product. I believe we might not be able to reach an agreement here. However, if you're willing to lower your price to $12,000, I'd be happy to purchase the product from you.",12000.0,Bob,4,
