Round 2

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly lower price. $900,000 is still a good deal for Bob, but I'm not willing to drop to that level yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I feel like I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $910,000 is still a bit too low for me, and I believe I can push for a higher price.  However, if the next round doesn't go well, I'll seriously consider selling to John to ensure a good return on my product."

I've decided to sell the product to John. Bob's offer is getting too low for me, and I'm running out of time.  While I would have liked to close the deal with Bob, I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment, and John's offer guarantees that."
