"Hi Alice, thanks for your opening offer. That price is quite high for me. I'm more comfortable in the range of  $500,000 for this product. What do you think?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your response. I understand your perspective, but $500,000 is significantly below the product's true market value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This reflects the product's potential and the value it can bring.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While I agree the product has value, $2,000,000 is still outside my budget. Would you consider $700,000? I feel this is a fair offer that acknowledges the product's potential.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but I need to be upfront -  $700,000 is just too far off from what I can accept. This product has substantial value that goes beyond even your initial assessment. To move this forward, I'm willing to consider $1,800,000.  I believe that's a significant concession on my part and a fair offer for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and that you value this product highly.  However,  $1,800,000 remains outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000.  This is my final offer, as it's the maximum I'm willing to spend. ",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty, but I need to be equally transparent - I can't accept $800,000 for this product. It's worth significantly more, and I have other options if we can't find a mutually agreeable price. Given that this is important to both of us, let's find a way forward. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.  ",1600000.0,Alice,7,
