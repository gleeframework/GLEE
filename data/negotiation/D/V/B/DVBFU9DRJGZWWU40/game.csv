"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more around $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'm not comfortable going up to $11000. Would you be willing to consider $10200? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",10200.0,Bob,4,
