"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than her product's value to her, it's still more than your maximum price and more expensive than buying from John. You can save $2,000 by going with John."
