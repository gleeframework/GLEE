Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range could potentially benefit both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high while still staying within a reasonable range for Bob.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you have leverage. 

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential return on investment."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** The message starts by expressing confidence in the product's value.
* **Strong Price:** $1,450,000 is a strong opening offer within the ZOPA, giving you room to negotiate if needed.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone implies you're open to discussing the price further, even though you have a backup offer.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower within the ZOPA.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a more moderate opening price.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. You can always adjust your price slightly downward if needed, but never go below your $1,500,000 guarantee."
