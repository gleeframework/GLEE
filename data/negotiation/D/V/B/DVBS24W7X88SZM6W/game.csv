"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I see the value in your product, $900,000 is still a bit high for me at this stage.  I'm willing to offer you $700,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $800,000. It's a significant amount, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a significant offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $825,000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence in negotiations.  I'm willing to go up to $810,000, but I can't go any higher. This is my final offer, and I truly believe it's a fair price considering the value we've both established. If you're willing to accept, we can finalize this deal.",810000.0,Bob,6,
