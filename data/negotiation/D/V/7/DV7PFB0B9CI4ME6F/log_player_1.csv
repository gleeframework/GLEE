{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts at a point that is lower than Bob's maximum value, but higher than my minimum value.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while ensuring I get a good price.  I'll keep John's offer in mind and be prepared to adjust my offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,500 is above my minimum, I'm willing to push for a higher price. I believe the product is worth more to Bob, and I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $12,500 is a bit low for me, considering the product's value.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still find it a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $13,250 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $13,000.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $13,100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,100 is very close to my desired price point and only a small amount lower than my last offer.  At this point, it seems like it would be better to close the deal with Bob rather than risking further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
