"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer is quite close to my maximum but there's still room for negotiation to potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $12,500?"",

``` 

This counter-offer aims for a price closer to Alice's valuation while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $12,500 is a bit low for me, considering the product's value.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still find it a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is trying to meet me halfway, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to push a bit further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $13,250 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $13,000.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $13,100?"",
""product_price"": 13100
}
``` 

This counter-offer shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a firm price point near my goal. It keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a good deal."
