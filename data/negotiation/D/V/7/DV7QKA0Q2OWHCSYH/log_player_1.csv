Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,000,000. It's a steal considering its true value, and I'm confident you'll see the potential it holds. Let's discuss this further and find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's potential, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. Can you meet me halfway and consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price than $800,000, which is what I could get from John. I want to see if I can squeeze a little more out of Bob before I settle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $900,000.  It's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway again and consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer of $850,000 is a good deal, and it's above my minimum price of $800,000. It's better to secure this profit than to risk losing the deal with Bob and only getting $800,000 from John."
