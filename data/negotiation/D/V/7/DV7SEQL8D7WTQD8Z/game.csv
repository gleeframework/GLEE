"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make it work within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to make it work within your budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.
