"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. I'm confident it will be a profitable investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good but not great.** While it's lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation. 
* **The goal is to save as much money as possible.**  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer, potentially bringing the price down further. 
* **Ten rounds are available.** This gives ample opportunity to negotiate before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a good profit for both of us.  Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better, but still not ideal.**  While closer to my target, there's still room to negotiate and potentially achieve a better price. 
* **Ten rounds remain.** This provides time to continue bargaining and potentially get a lower price.
* **John's offer is a fallback option.**  If negotiations fail, I can always purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and our respective needs.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $950,000. This price fairly reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a valuable investment for you. Let's find a way to close this deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is standing firm at $950,000.** She's unlikely to go lower, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.
* **The offer is within my budget.**  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a significant savings compared to John's offer.
* **Time is a factor.**  With only five rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal increases with each round. 

Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price and avoids the potential of having to buy from John at a much higher cost."
