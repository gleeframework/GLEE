"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $11,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $12,500? I believe that's a fair compromise.",12500.0,Alice,3,
