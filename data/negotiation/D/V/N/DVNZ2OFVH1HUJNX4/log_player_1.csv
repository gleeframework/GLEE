Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this reflects a fair deal considering its worth to both of us."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $1,400,000 gives you room for negotiation while ensuring you'd still make a significant profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, subtly justifying the higher price.  
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The tone remains open for discussion, allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have limited information about Bob's financial capacity and negotiation tactics. Gathering more information about Bob's willingness to pay could lead to an even more profitable offer."
