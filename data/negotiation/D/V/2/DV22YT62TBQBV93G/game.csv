"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $925,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $937,500.  This is a fair price that allows for a smooth transaction. Let's seal the deal!",937500.0,Alice,5,
