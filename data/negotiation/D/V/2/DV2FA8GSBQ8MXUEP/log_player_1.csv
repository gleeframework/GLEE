Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's valuation of $80 but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price as close to my minimum of $120 as possible, but I need to consider Bob's potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90.  While it's better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm countering with a price of $100. This is still higher than Bob's offer of $90, but lower than my initial offer of $110, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise. I believe $100 is a reasonable price that balances my need to make a profit with the potential for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is too low. While I am willing to negotiate, his offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120, ensuring I get a fair price and avoid further negotiation."
