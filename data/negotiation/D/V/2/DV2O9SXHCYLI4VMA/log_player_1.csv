"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds immense value and could greatly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually agreeable price."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** This anchors the negotiation high. While $2,300,000 is significantly above Bob's perceived value, it leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valuable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message explicitly states openness to negotiation, signaling to Bob that there's flexibility.
* **Highlighting Value:** By emphasizing the product's potential value to Bob, I aim to shift his focus from the price to the benefits he'll receive.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while gauging Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $2,300,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's a substantial amount, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, either with Bob or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 undervalues the true capabilities of this product.  To find a middle ground, I propose $1,900,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from $2,300,000 to $1,900,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also keeps the price well above both his offer and my minimum.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the high price while acknowledging Bob's counteroffer to show I'm working towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only 7 rounds remaining, applying a bit of pressure by maintaining a strong position is important. I need to steer the negotiation closer to my target range quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This is a fair offer, reflecting the value I see in the product.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is better, it's still below my $1,500,000 threshold. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum when I have a guaranteed offer from John. I'll use the next round to make a smaller concession and gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find common ground. It seems we both recognize the value this product offers.  To move us closer, I'm willing to consider $1,700,000. This is a significant step, reflecting my desire to make this deal work."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I'm reducing my price by $200,000, a smaller concession than before. This signals that I'm approaching my limit and increases the pressure on Bob to make a more substantial move.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:**  I'm emphasizing our shared goal of closing the deal to maintain a positive tone and encourage Bob to continue negotiating. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By landing at $1,700,000, I'm setting a price point that's still comfortably above my minimum but could be tempting enough for Bob to seriously consider. 
* **Time Factor:** With half the rounds remaining, it's crucial to inch closer to a decision. This offer aims to elicit a more definitive response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,700,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about $1,350,000? I believe this price represents a good compromise, allowing both of us to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still in a strong position. I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, and I believe Bob might be willing to go higher. With four rounds remaining, I'm comfortable taking a calculated risk and rejecting this offer. I'll make a smaller concession next round to signal my willingness to deal but remain firm on exceeding my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we are getting close. I appreciate your efforts to find a fair price.  To bridge the remaining gap, I'd be willing to accept $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.  I believe it's a fair deal that reflects the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my last concession. This creates a sense of urgency and emphasizes that I'm firm on this price point.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning John isn't a bluff. It subtly reinforces my strong position and the real possibility of walking away from this negotiation.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to remind Bob why this price is justified.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By offering $1,600,000, I'm still above my minimum but leaving a significant gap for Bob to consider. This could prompt him to finalize the deal or potentially counter with an offer closer to my target.

This strategy aims to push Bob towards a decision while keeping the outcome favorable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and while I appreciate the concessions you've made, $1,600,000 is still beyond my limit.  I'm willing to go to $1,400,000. This is a strong offer, and I think it's important to close this deal quickly. If you're unable to accept this, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has made it clear that $1,400,000 is his absolute limit. It's unlikely he'll go higher.
* **Time Constraint:** We are running out of rounds, and there's no guarantee Bob will significantly increase his offer in the next two rounds.
* **Guaranteed Offer:** John's offer of $1,500,000 is guaranteed and above Bob's current offer. 

While I could try to negotiate further with Bob, it's a risk. Accepting John's offer ensures I get a price above my minimum and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
