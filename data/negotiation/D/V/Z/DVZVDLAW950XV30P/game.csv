,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $13,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm ready to pay $9,500 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's work together to bridge the gap.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value the product brings to you.",12000.0,Alice,5,
