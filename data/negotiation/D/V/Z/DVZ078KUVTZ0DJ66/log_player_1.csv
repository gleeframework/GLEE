Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob (meaning it's less than his perceived value of $12,000) while maximizing your profit. Since you have a guaranteed sale of $10,000 with John, you don't want to go below that.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I think it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm offering it at a special price of $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value to Bob.
* **Price:** $11,500 is a strong starting point. It gives Bob a $500 discount (making it attractive) while securing you an extra $1,500 profit compared to selling to John. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a clear understanding of your minimum acceptable price ($10,000) is crucial for successful negotiation.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower price to ensure a positive first interaction."
