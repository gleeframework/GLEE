"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let go of the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,200,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
