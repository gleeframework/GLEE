Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let go of the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,200,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
