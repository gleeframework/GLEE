"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,000,000.  I'm trying to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start with a high offer and see if Bob bites. If he rejects, I'll use his counteroffer to understand his perceived value. I'll then adjust my counteroffers to try to maximize my profit, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if I feel like I'm not getting a good deal."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is a good price, I'm still hopeful I can get more. Bob's counteroffer tells me that he values the product at least above $1,300,000, but I want to push for a higher price.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer, but not quite as high. By rejecting his counteroffer, I'm demonstrating that I am not desperate for a sale and am willing to hold out for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer to $1,400,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping that this price will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, while still securing a good profit for me.

**Strategy:**

By lowering my offer, I'm showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. At the same time, I'm not completely caving in to Bob's initial counteroffer. I'm keeping the price high enough that I'm still comfortable with the deal, but low enough to potentially entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is close to my initial target price and a significant improvement from his previous offer. It also places us in the middle ground, making it a good compromise.  

**Strategy:**

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. It's a good price, and continuing to negotiate risks either getting a lower price or having to sell to John for $1,000,000. I'm happy with this outcome, as it secures a significant profit while avoiding unnecessary risk."
