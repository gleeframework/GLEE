"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's essential to remember your bottom line. You value the product at no less than $1,500,000, and John is offering that amount guaranteed.  There's no need to risk further negotiation with Bob when you have a guaranteed sale at your minimum acceptable price."
