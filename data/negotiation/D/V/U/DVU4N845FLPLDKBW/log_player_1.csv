Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate.
* **Confidence:** My message expresses confidence in the product's value, hoping to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message doesn't close the door on negotiation, making Bob feel like he can counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while also leaving open the possibility of a mutually agreeable deal. If Bob rejects my offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is better than my minimum ($10,000), it's still significantly below my desired price point. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe I can still get closer to my ideal price with further negotiation. 
* **John is a Safe Option:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price without risking selling at a price I'm not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering its value. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise price that's in between Bob's offer and my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to encourage Bob to see it as a good investment.
* **Focus on Collaboration:** The message emphasizes working together to reach a deal, fostering a more positive and cooperative atmosphere.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground, potentially leading to a successful negotiation and a price closer to my desired amount."
