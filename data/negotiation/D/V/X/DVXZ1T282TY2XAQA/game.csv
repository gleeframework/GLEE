"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe the asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true worth and potential for generating value.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,300,000. This reflects a fair compromise while acknowledging the substantial benefits you'll receive.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
