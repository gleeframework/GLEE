Alice's offer:

While $160 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum. You can likely get a better deal by rejecting and continuing to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

While $140 is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your goal of $100."
