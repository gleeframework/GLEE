Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. I believe it's worth a significant amount to the right buyer,  and I'm setting the price at $1,800,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a much higher profit than John's offer.
* **Scarcity tactic:**  By mentioning I'll offer it to someone else if he refuses, I create a sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially making the offer seem more desirable. 
* **Justification:** I don't explicitly state *why* the price is so high, leaving room for Bob to convince himself of its value.

While this strategy is aggressive, it offers the highest potential reward. If Bob rejects the offer, I can always fall back on John's guaranteed $1,000,000."
