"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a reasonable opening offer.** It's above your minimum of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's friendly and invites discussion.**  This sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to engage.
* **It doesn't reveal your bottom line.**  This gives you leverage in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $8,800? It's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $9,000,  Bob's offer of $8,800 is a good deal.  It's above my minimum and allows me to avoid the risk of selling to John for $8,000.  This seems like a good point to secure the sale."
