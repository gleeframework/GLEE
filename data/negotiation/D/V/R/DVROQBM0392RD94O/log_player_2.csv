"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,300,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. While I see its value, $1,300,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by demonstrating a willingness to purchase the product while simultaneously offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. It's a strong starting point that leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,250,000 is still within your budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,500,000. While you could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and forcing you to buy from John at a higher price is too high. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a good price within your budget."
