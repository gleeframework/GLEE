"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $140 for it. This is a special offer tailored to appreciate your interest and ensure you receive the best possible deal. Please let me know if this proposal suits your budget, and we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is lower than her product's value to her ($150), it's still higher than your maximum budget of $120 and what John offers. You can save money by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
