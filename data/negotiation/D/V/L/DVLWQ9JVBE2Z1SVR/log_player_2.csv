# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her, and you can likely get a better deal. There's no reason to buy from John right now as Alice is offering a lower price.  You should counter-offer and see if you can negotiate a better price."

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially secure an even better price.  John's price is still higher than Alice's latest offer."

Alice is now offering a higher price than your last counteroffer, and she's getting closer to your target price. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price.  It's important to remember that you can still buy the product from John, but you should try to get the best possible price from Alice first."

Alice is refusing to budge on her price. You have already made several counteroffers and come close to her price, but she's unwilling to move.  It's clear that you won't be able to reach an agreement with Alice.  At this point, it's better to buy from John, who is willing to sell you the product for $1,200,000, which is still within your budget.  You are better off buying from John to avoid further negotiation."
