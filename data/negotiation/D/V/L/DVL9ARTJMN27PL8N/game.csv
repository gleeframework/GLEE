"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there at $9,750.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,125. It's a good price for both of us and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10125.0,Alice,5,
