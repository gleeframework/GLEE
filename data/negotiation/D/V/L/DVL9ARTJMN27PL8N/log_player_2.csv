Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still not quite there at $9,750.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,125. It's a good price for both of us and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is getting closer to a price I'm willing to pay, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $10,000.  I can save myself further negotiation and potential risk by buying from John for my target price."
