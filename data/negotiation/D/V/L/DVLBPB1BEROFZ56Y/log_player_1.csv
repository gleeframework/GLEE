Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer aims to:

* **Start high:**  $100 is a good starting point, allowing for negotiation space.
* **Highlight Bob's value:** Reminding Bob of the product's worth to him increases his motivation to accept.
* **Leave room for counteroffers:** $100 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers, while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, $90 is still a good price, exceeding my minimum and leaving a profit. Accepting ensures the sale and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further negotiation."
