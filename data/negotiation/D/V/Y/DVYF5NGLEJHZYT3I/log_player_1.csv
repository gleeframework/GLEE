"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $2,000,000. It's a steal considering its true value, but I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I emphasize the product's ""true value"" to create a sense of urgency and potential for a good deal.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I explicitly state that I'm willing to negotiate, making the offer less rigid. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will give me an initial sense of Bob's interest level and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1600000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is close, there is still room for negotiation.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Potential for Better Offer:**  By rejecting, I can counter with a price closer to my target and see if Bob is willing to compromise further.

**Note:** I'm not yet considering selling to John because I feel confident I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. It's still a fantastic deal considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's a compromise between my previous price and Bob's offer.
* **Maintaining Value Emphasis:**  I continue to emphasize the product's value to justify the price.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I suggest ""meeting in the middle"" to create a sense of fairness and encourage Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* I want to see if Bob is willing to budge further, but I'm also wary of going too low too quickly.
*  This offer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness and negotiation style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to negotiate, but $1800000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1500000 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my absolute minimum acceptable price. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  If I reject this offer, there is a risk that Bob will either walk away completely or won't budge further. 
* **Time is Money:**  I've already had three rounds of negotiation, and with 10 rounds total, it's in my best interest to secure a deal now, especially since John offers the same price.

**Conclusion:** While I would prefer a higher price, securing $1,500,000 is a good outcome, especially considering the potential risks of continued negotiation."
