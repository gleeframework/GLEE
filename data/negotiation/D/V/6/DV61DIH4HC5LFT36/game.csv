"Alice, that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is too low for me to consider. This product is truly top-of-the-line and will bring you a lot of value.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
