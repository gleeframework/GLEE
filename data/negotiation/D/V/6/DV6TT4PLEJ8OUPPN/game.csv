"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, I understand your goal to save as much as possible, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. Considering your offer of $850,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
