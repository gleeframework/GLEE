``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $1,300,000
* **Your maximum budget:** $1,500,000
* **John's price:** $1,500,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $200,000 compared to buying from John. While you could potentially negotiate with Alice further, the savings are already significant, and it's likely you won't be able to get a price much lower."
