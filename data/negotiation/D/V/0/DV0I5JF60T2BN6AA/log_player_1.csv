Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure I can go that high. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $14,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is moving in the right direction, it's unlikely we'll bridge the gap to a price I find acceptable within the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
