Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room to negotiate.  I'm confident I can get a price closer to my minimum of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price range with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm lowering my price from $1,800,000 to $1,600,000.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this will incentivize Bob to come closer to my price range in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'm going to reject it and make another counteroffer.  I'm confident that with a few more rounds of negotiation, we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

I'm lowering my price again to $1,400,000.  This further demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.  I believe this is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a reasonable profit."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm starting to run out of time and the risk of not closing a deal is increasing.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This guarantees a good deal and minimizes any further risk."
