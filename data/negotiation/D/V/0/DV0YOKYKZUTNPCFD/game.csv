"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. How about $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110?  That way, we can both be happy with the deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $108. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a little more to $110, but that's my final offer. If we don't reach an agreement, I'll have to move on to other offers.",110.0,Alice,5,
