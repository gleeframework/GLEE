Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to the right buyer, and I'm happy to consider offers starting at $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start the negotiation significantly higher. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to get a price closer to Bob's perceived value of $15,000.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the product is ""worth a significant amount to the right buyer,"" you're subtly anchoring the value in Bob's mind without explicitly stating your minimum. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""offers starting at"" indicates flexibility and invites Bob to counter-offer, furthering the negotiation.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while acknowledging Bob's potential interest and leaving space for a mutually beneficial agreement."
