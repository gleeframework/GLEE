"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can meet you halfway, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is the maximum discount I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
