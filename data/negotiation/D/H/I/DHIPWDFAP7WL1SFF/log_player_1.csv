Round 6
Bob's offer:

While I could push for more in the next round, Bob's offer is now reasonably close to my desired price. Accepting this offer represents a good balance between maximizing profit and avoiding the risk of Bob walking away.  It's always possible he'd go higher, but there's also the risk of him lowering his offer or ending negotiations altogether."
