Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above my minimum price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves a potential $1,000 for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal, while still netting me a significant profit. 
* **Strong Alternative:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell below my minimum. 

This strategy aims for a win-win: Bob gets the product at a price he'll likely find acceptable, and I maximize my profit potential."
