Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm suggesting a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Strong Starting Point:** $1,350,000 gives Bob a potential profit of $150,000 while still leaving me with a significant gain above John's offer.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair reflection"" to make the price seem more appealing and less arbitrary.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's personality and negotiation style, I might be willing to come down slightly. However, I'll hold firm knowing I have John as a guaranteed backup buyer at $1,000,000."
