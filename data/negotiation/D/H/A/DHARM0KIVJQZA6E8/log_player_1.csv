"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it!  I'm starting at $175, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John.  I'll try to negotiate with Bob further to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This still leaves me some room, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice! However, $140 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $130 is still below my floor.  I'm not desperate, and selling to John guarantees me a better price.  I'm willing to take one more round with Bob to see if I can get him to $140, but after that, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, I can't go any lower than $140. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a deal that would work for me.  Let's see if we can make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $140. Would you be willing to consider a price of $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to my minimum price, but $135 is still not enough for me.  I've made my best offer and I don't want to waste any more time. John is a guaranteed sale at a price I'm happy with, so I'm going to sell to him."
