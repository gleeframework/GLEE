"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500.

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7800. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $8100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair price for the value the product will bring to your business.",8100.0,Alice,5,
