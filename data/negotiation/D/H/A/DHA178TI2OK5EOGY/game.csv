"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750?  I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. How about we try again? I'm willing to go up to $10,800, but that's as high as I can go. This is my final offer.",10800.0,Alice,5,
