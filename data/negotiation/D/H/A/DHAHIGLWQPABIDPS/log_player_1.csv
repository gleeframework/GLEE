Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I want to get for the product. I'll see if I can get him to budge closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $145?  I think that's a fair price for both of us, and we can get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 145}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but $145 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $130? I think that's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still not comfortable with $130. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to move closer to my desired price. If he doesn't, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $130 just doesn't work for me.  Let's meet in the middle one last time at $140.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $135, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I've reached a point where I'm not confident that I can get Bob to come up to a price that's worth my time. I've already made several concessions, and it seems like we're at an impasse. Rather than risk losing more time and potentially getting a worse offer from Bob, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. This will ensure I get my minimum desired price and avoid further negotiation."
