"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $120, but Alice is asking for $110.  This means there's room for negotiation.
* **You want to save money:**  Rejecting the offer gives you the chance to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price. 
* **John is a fallback:** You have the option of buying from John for $120, so you're not desperate to accept Alice's first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  My counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's price but still above her value of $80. This signals my willingness to negotiate but also shows I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Room for compromise:** This leaves room for Alice to counter with a price closer to $100, which would be a good outcome for both of us.
* **Time is on my side:** We have 9 rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to accept her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $110 is my ideal price point, I could be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice has moved closer to my desired price, and we're now at a point where the price is within my acceptable range.
* **Saving money:**  $100 is still a better price than buying from John, and I'm saving $10 compared to Alice's initial offer.
* **Time is running out:**  We've already had two rounds of negotiation, and with 7 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy the product at a good price."
