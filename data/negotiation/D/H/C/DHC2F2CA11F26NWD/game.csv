"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,000,000. This is an exceptional offer, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to your response!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and your asking price.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you and the original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",950000.0,Alice,3,
