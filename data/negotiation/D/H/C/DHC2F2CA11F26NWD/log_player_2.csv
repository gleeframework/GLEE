"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,000,000. This is an exceptional offer, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is good, there's still room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, you can try to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and your asking price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you and the original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is a good deal. It's still a significant savings compared to the $1,200,000 you'd pay John.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your offer and ending up buying from John at a higher price is too high.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product for a good price."
