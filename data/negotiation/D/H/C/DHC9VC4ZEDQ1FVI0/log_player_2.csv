Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think I can do better. How about I meet you at $115? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $115 is a reasonable price, saving $35 from John's offer. It's time to accept."
