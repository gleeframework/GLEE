Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **Potential Profit for Bob:**  Bob could make a profit of $200,000 if he buys from you at your minimum and then resells at his valuation.

**Strategy**

You want to capture as much of that potential profit as possible without pushing Bob away. Offering a price slightly below his valuation gives him an incentive to buy from you immediately.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident this offer reflects that.  Are you ready to move forward?"", 
""product_price"": 1180000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** Creates a sense of exclusivity and value while keeping the tone positive and collaborative.
* **The Price:**  $1,180,000 leaves Bob with a potential $20,000 profit, which is still a strong incentive to buy from you.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:**  We don't know if Bob is a tough negotiator. He might try to counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate but stay firm on your minimum price.
* **Relationship Building:** Even though you have a backup buyer, a positive relationship with Bob could lead to future opportunities."
