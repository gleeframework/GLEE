"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm not quite willing to meet you at $12000. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $13500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $13500 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $12500. Can you consider that price?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. The product's value is still substantial, and I believe it's worth the investment. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to finalize the deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one last counteroffer. I'll meet you at $12750. It's a compromise that still reflects the product's value, but I'm willing to make a slight concession to close the deal.",12750.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your last offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $12500, which is the highest I can go. Can you consider it?",12500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $12750, but only if you're willing to throw in a small bonus or additional service that adds value to the deal. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $12500. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000.",12500.0,Bob,10,
