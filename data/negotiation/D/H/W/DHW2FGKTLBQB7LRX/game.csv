"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $140 is a bit high for me. I'd be happy to pay $125. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $125 is just too far off my minimum.  How about we split the difference and go with $132.50? That would give us both a fair deal.",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $132.50 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $128, which is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!",128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $128 is still a little too low for me.  I'm prepared to drop my price a bit more, but $130 is the absolute lowest I can go. Let's close this deal!",130.0,Alice,5,
