"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a decent profit.  I'm aiming to find a price that both of us are happy with, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $140 is a bit high for me. I'd be happy to pay $125. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value. There are still 8 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $125 is just too far off my minimum.  How about we split the difference and go with $132.50? That would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 132.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $132.50 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $128, which is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below $150. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price. There are still 6 rounds left, giving me ample opportunity to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $128 is still a little too low for me.  I'm prepared to drop my price a bit more, but $130 is the absolute lowest I can go. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 130}
