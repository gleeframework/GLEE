"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me and still allows you to make a profit.  Let me know your thoughts!

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Alice's offer:
