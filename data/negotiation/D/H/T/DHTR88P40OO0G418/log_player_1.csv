"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's 16.67% higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept. This allows some room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm going to see if I can get a better price.  I'm not going to sell to John yet, because I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.  There are still 8 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly, to $1,300,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is only slightly less than the $1,200,000 I would get from John.  I've already gone through 3 rounds of negotiations and I don't want to risk losing this deal.  It's better to accept his offer and secure the sale."
