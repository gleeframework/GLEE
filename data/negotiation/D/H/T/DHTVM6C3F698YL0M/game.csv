"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make a strong opening offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's true value is $1,200,000 to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm aiming to stay within my budget. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is still a fair price given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product at $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value is $1,200,000 to you. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
