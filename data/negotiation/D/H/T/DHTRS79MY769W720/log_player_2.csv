"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is truly a remarkable item. I believe it's worth more than its face value and could greatly enhance your daily life or work. Considering its quality and potential benefits, I'm extending an exclusive offer to you. Would you like to make it yours for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're willing to pay $100 for the product from John, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer.  Rejecting her offer allows you to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or buy the product from John at your maximum price."
