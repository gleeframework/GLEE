"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you my unique product. It holds significant value to me, but I understand its worth might be different for you. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $85. I hope we can find a fair price that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $85 is significantly lower than your maximum price of $120.  There's room for negotiation to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a price you're more comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $85 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your offer, I believe we can reach an agreement that respects both our positions. I am willing to sell the product for $95. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $95 is still below your maximum price of $120 and is closer to your previous counteroffer of $100.  It's a good compromise and saves you $25 compared to buying from John."
