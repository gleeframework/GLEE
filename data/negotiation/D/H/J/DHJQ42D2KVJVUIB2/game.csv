"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest.  While $12000 isn't quite where I need to be, I'm willing to come down to $17000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $15500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still hoping for a price closer to $14000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures a smooth transaction.  Let me know what you think.",14750.0,Bob,6,
