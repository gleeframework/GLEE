"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $100 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $80, ensuring you profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** $100 is less than what Bob values the product at ($120), giving him an incentive to buy.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still go higher if Bob is willing to pay more, but this offer sets a strong starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I am interested, but I can only pay up to $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is still higher than your minimum acceptable price of $80.  While you could try to negotiate further, accepting his offer in this round is a good strategy:

* **Securing a profit:** You're guaranteed a profit of $10, which is a good outcome.
* **Time efficiency:**  Further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price, and you risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Potential for future relationships:** Accepting Bob's offer demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise, potentially opening the door for future business interactions."
