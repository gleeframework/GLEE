"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire a remarkable product that I believe would greatly benefit you. This product holds immense value to me, and I am confident it will serve you well. Considering its significance and the benefits it offers, I am extending an offer to sell it to you at a price of $12,000. I believe this is a fair and advantageous proposition, given the $8,000 value you perceive in it. Should you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to reach out. I look forward to the possibility of facilitating this transaction with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than John's offer of $8,000. While Alice's message tries to highlight the product's value, you have already established your maximum price point at $8,000.  Rejecting this offer opens the door for you to secure the product at a much lower cost from John."
