"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity! I'm sure you've heard of the incredible value this product holds, and I believe it can be a game-changer for your business.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  To get started, I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Starting with a high price of $1,200,000 leaves room for negotiation and allows for a good profit margin for Alice. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and optimistic, aiming to build rapport with Bob.
* **Highlight Value:**  Emphasizing the product's value to Bob helps justify the asking price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates Alice is open to finding a price that works for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. I would like to make a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value to Alice:**  $900,000 is still a very good price for Alice, but she can likely get more. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** Alice has 8 more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get closer to her desired price.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John is a safe option, there's a good chance Alice can secure a higher price by continuing with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While it's a good starting point, I'm still hoping to find a price that reflects the true value of this product for you.  Considering the potential impact it can have on your business, I'd like to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This allows for a significant margin for you and ensures a fair return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  Alice has lowered her price from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:** Alice continues to emphasize the value the product holds for Bob, justifying her price point.
* **Fairness:**  Alice frames the offer as a win-win scenario, highlighting a ""significant margin"" for Bob and a ""fair return"" for herself. 
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $1,000,000 is still significantly higher than Alice's minimum of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. Let me think about it for a moment. In light of our previous discussions, I would like to counter with an offer of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing in on Value:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is very close to Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation is high.  
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a substantial profit for Alice, even though it's slightly lower than what she initially hoped for.  
* **Risk of Lower Offers:** There's a chance that Bob could make a lower offer in future rounds, making the risk of rejection too high."
