Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave some room for negotiation while still securing a good profit.  I'm also being friendly and positive to build a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I've done my research, and I know the product is worth more to you than that, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $110? It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering a price closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly above my minimum acceptable price. I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the offer and the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $105? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not profitable enough for me. I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $112?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the product. Let's find a way to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 112}
```

I'm raising the price a bit from the previous round, but still keeping it below my minimum acceptable price. I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer and the potential for a win-win situation to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120.  It's clear that Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum acceptable price, and we're running out of rounds. It's better to secure a sale at my minimum price than to continue negotiating and risk losing out completely."
