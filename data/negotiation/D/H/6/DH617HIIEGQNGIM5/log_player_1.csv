Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to pay less than $120. Could we discuss a price closer to $100?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer. I'll counter with a price closer to $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is simply too low for me. How about $110? It's still a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While tempting, $95 is below my minimum. I'll counter with a price closer to my previous offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still willing to negotiate, but $95 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's a fair price, and we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can find a middle ground. Would $100 be acceptable for both of us? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation. While I'd ideally like to get more, Bob's offer is my minimum, and we're already halfway through the rounds. Accepting his offer is the best way to guarantee a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
