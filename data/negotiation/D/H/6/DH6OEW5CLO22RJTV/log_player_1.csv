Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 99}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $99 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, but still ensures you make a good profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** This price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but not so high that it's immediately off-putting. It creates an opportunity to highlight the product's value and potentially sway his decision."
