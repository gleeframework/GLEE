"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $10,000. This is an excellent opportunity for you to benefit from its value, which you've assessed at $12,000. Let's discuss how we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product, I propose a price of $9,500. This allows us to move closer to a mutually beneficial solution while still ensuring a fair return for me. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still within Bob's budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $12,000. 
* While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject his next counteroffer and Bob would be forced to buy from John at a higher price. 
* Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a good price for Bob and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
