{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. Let me know what you think!  "", ""product_price"": 20000} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to create a good rapport with Bob.
* **Open-Ended:** I'm not forcing Bob into a yes or no answer, giving him space to express interest and potentially counter-offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his reaction. If he rejects, I'll need to gauge his interest level and determine if I want to counter-offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm interested, but I'd need to see it at $15000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowball:** Bob is offering my minimum price, which is not ideal. I'd prefer to get more than that if possible.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe there's room for negotiation. If I reject his offer, I can try to get him to meet me somewhere in the middle.
* **Avoiding Immediate Loss:** While $15,000 is my minimum, selling to John right now would be a missed opportunity.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming for a compromise. I'll need to assess his interest level and potential for a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $15,000 is my minimum, I'd prefer to get closer to $17,500 for this unique product. It's truly something special, and I think it's worth the investment. Let's find a number that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a halfway point between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's uniqueness and value to emphasize its worth.
* **Collaborative Approach:** I'm using language that fosters a sense of collaboration and finding a mutually beneficial solution.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely observe Bob's response to see if he's willing to budge or if he's set on his original offer. If he rejects again, I'll have to weigh the risk of losing a potential sale against my desire for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand it's unique, but $17500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $16000, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Target:** Bob's offer of $16,000 is only $1,000 below my ideal price of $17,500. This is a reasonable compromise.
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:**  The potential for further negotiation is low. Bob has already shown a willingness to increase his offer.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, I risk losing him as a buyer.

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. This is a good outcome, as I've secured a price that's close to my ideal and I've avoided a protracted negotiation process."
