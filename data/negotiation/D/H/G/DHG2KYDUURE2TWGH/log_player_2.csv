"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better price from Alice.  While $750,000 is a good deal, it's still $50,000 more than you want to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer!  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap a little.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend closer to $700,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $725,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

Alice has come down to $725,000, which is only $25,000 more than my target.  It's a good deal considering my alternative is paying $800,000 to John."
