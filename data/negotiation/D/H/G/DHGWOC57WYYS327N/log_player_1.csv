Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives Bob a good deal compared to what I know the product is worth to me, but also leaves room for negotiation if he's interested.  I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a bit more, but if he's not, I can always go down a bit or accept his counteroffer.  

It's important to remember that I can always fall back on John's offer of $8,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well."
