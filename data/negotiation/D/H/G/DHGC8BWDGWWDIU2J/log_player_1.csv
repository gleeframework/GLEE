Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice needs to make at least $1,200,000. This is her reservation price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 from John.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim for a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation to maximize her profit while ensuring Bob accepts.  Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 risks rejection, forcing Alice to accept the lower offer from John.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find this a fair offer. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  The message strikes a balance between highlighting the product's value to Bob and positioning the offer as fair.
* **The Price: **  $1,400,000 leaves Bob with a profit of $100,000, making it highly likely he'll accept. This price also nets Alice a significant profit over her minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. Alice could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price, but this strategy maximizes her chances of a successful sale at a price significantly above her reservation price."
