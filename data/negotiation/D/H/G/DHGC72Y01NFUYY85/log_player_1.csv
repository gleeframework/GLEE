Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. It gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring a good profit for me. I'm hoping that Bob values the product highly and will accept this offer. If not, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and make decisions based on his valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's not even close to my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm reducing my offer to $1,300,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not willing to sell for a significantly lower price. I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and will encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is a bit higher than before, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm reducing my price again to $1,100,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable value, but it shows Bob I'm serious about selling. I'm hoping this offer will be tempting enough for Bob to consider, but I'm prepared to sell to John if he continues to refuse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to accept anything under my minimum value, and I'm getting impatient. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to Bob at such a low price."
