Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $120 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we can start with a higher offer. This leaves room for negotiation or a potentially higher profit.
* **Reasonable Markup:** A price of $150 represents a 25% markup, which isn't unreasonable and leaves a good chance Bob might accept. 
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. There are other valid approaches depending on how much risk you're willing to take and how you perceive Bob's negotiation style."
