"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring you significant value. My initial offer for the product is $18,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a price that reflects its true worth to me.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $14,000. I believe this price is still a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $14,000 is still a little more than I'm hoping to spend. How about $13,000?  That would be a fair compromise, I think.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll meet you at $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
