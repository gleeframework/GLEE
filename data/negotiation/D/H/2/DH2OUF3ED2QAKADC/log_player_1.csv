Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $105 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $115.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is exceptional, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $107.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still aiming for a price closer to $110.  While $107.5 is tempting, I think I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  Would you consider $109?  It's a compromise, and it's still a great price for the value this product brings."", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit too high on my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $106. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $106 is a decent price, I'm still hoping to squeeze out a few more dollars.  I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll try one more counteroffer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I'm confident this product will be worth every penny.  I'm willing to come down to $108.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go up to $108. I'm willing to meet you at $105.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105.5.

This is getting a bit close to my minimum price, but I'm confident I can't get a better offer from Bob.  Accepting $105.50 is better than selling to John for $100."
