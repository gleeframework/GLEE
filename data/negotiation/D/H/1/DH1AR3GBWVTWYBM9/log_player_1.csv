{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by setting a high price that is within the range of what Bob is willing to pay, while giving me room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $900,000 is too low for me. While I want to sell the product, I'm not desperate and know it's worth more. I'll counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately not a feasible price for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair profit for me.  Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer compromises by meeting Bob halfway, but still maintains a price that is above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hopeful that Bob will see the value in the product and accept this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1050000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a fair compromise that would benefit both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. John is a guaranteed buyer for $1,000,000, so I'll continue to negotiate with Bob but won't settle for a lower price yet.  I'll try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position, but $950,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value to you, and it's my final offer. If you're not able to meet this, I'll have to accept John's offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. It matches John's price, making it a win-win for both of us. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll go with John's offer, ensuring I receive my minimum price."
