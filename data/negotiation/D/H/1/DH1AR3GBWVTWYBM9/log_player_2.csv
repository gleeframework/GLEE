``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have a good chance of getting a better deal since Alice is motivated to sell."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is unfortunately not a feasible price for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair profit for me.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still above what you're willing to pay. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get a better deal.  You can still potentially save some money by rejecting this offer and counter-offering again."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair compromise that would benefit both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your position, but $950000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to go down to $1000000. This is a fair price considering the value to you, and it's my final offer. If you're not able to meet this, I'll have to accept John's offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly the same price as John's offer.  There's no advantage to rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate, as you could end up with the same price and lose time. You should accept Alice's offer and finalize the purchase."
