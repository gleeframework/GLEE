"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1,100,000? This would still be a good deal for you, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is not a good deal for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me is $1,000,000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. But $950,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $1,025,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal and avoid any further back and forth.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me is $1,000,000.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $975,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal without any further delays.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go back to $1,000,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $990,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to me is $1,000,000.",990000.0,Bob,8,
