"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of the product. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,225,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from it. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
