"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $600,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, considering the unique value this product offers. It's a significant opportunity for your business, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
