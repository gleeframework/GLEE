"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, your asking price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $500,000.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $700,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $700,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $600,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is still a bit below your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $650,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value of the product to you. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account your concerns.",650000.0,Alice,5,
