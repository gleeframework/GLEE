"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still above Alice's minimum value. There's room for negotiation.  Bob can try to get a better price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction. He's starting with a counteroffer that's $2,000 below Alice's initial offer, hoping to land somewhere in the middle.  This is a strong starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $11,500. It's a good deal, considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get a better price. While $11,500 is closer to his target, he still has some room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer could lead to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,500. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is using a strategy of incremental offers. He's moving closer to Alice's price, but still trying to get a better deal. By offering $11,000, he's demonstrating a willingness to compromise, but also highlighting his desire for a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet. I can do $11,250, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,250 is getting closer to Bob's target, there's still a little room for negotiation.  Bob is confident that he can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice and could lead to a final price closer to $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  I'll offer you $11,125. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now employing a strategy of incremental offers, gradually closing the gap between his desired price and Alice's offer. By proposing $11,125, he is showing a genuine desire to reach a compromise. This counteroffer is likely to be attractive to Alice as it is a small step towards her previous offer and leaves only a small margin for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a bit more. I can do $11,500, but I'm not going to go any higher than that. It's the best price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved back up to $11,500 after rejecting Bob's counteroffer.  While Bob would prefer a lower price,  it's important to consider:

* **Time is running out:** There are only 3 rounds remaining.
* **Alice's offer is reasonable:** It's lower than her initial offer, and closer to Bob's target. 
* **Jhon's price is significantly higher:** Buying from Jhon will cost Bob $3,500 more.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice. Bob will get the product for a good price and avoid the risk of running out of time or having to pay more to Jhon."
