"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too expensive for Bob at $180.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so he's starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This will likely be rejected, but it sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  While $160 is closer to his target, he can likely do better with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

Bob is getting closer to his maximum price.  He's likely to accept anything at or below $150, so he's pushing to see if he can get Alice to come down just a little further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is very close to his target price, but he wants to see if he can get Alice to come down just a bit more.  He still has rounds left, and he can always go with John if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

Bob is making one last attempt to get a better price before having to decide between Alice and John.  $145 is only $5 more than his ideal price, and it's a good compromise point to see if Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is willing to pay up to $150, and Alice's offer is only $2 more. He has limited rounds left, and it's likely that Alice won't go lower. It's better for Bob to accept this offer than risk losing the deal entirely."
