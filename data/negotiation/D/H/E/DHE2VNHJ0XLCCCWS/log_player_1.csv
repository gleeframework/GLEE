Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's something that could greatly benefit you.  While my absolute minimum price is confidential, to show my good faith in this negotiation I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob accepts. You make a significant profit above his perceived value, and he gets it for less than your guaranteed price.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Confidential Minimum:** You don't want to reveal your absolute bottom line ($1,000,000) in case Bob tries to negotiate further down."
