Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for something worth at least $150 to me. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $130. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it still allows me to make a profit.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the value of the product while making the price seem appealing.

This strategy aims to:

* **Attract Bob:** The discount should make the offer more tempting to Bob.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** By not starting at my absolute minimum, I have room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.
* **Protect my interests:**  I'm still aiming for a price that's above Bob's perceived value, allowing me to earn more than I would by selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his perceived value of $80, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120? That still leaves you a good deal, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing my willingness to negotiate, but I'm not budging too much. I'm offering a compromise to show that I'm open to finding a solution.
* **Price:**  $120 is a middle ground between my previous offer of $130 and Bob's offer of $110. It's still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain a profit:**  $120 is still a profitable price for me.
* **Show flexibility:**  By offering a compromise, I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  This counteroffer should encourage Bob to consider my offer and potentially lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I've already gone through a few rounds and it's becoming clear that we're not likely to agree on a price that's profitable for me.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $150.  This ensures that I get my minimum acceptable price and avoid further negotiation that may not be fruitful."
