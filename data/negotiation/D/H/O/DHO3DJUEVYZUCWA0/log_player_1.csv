Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a firm budget. I can do $10,000, and that's my final offer. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

```

**Reasoning:** Bob has made it clear that $10,000 is his absolute limit.  It's unlikely we'll be able to bridge the gap between his valuation and our minimum acceptable price. John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially getting a lower offer."
