"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a minimum of $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it holds immense value for you as well. To kick things off, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value you place on the product, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than the product's value to both of us.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, especially since we have 8 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest,  $950,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000.  This allows for some room for negotiation, while still reflecting the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I would like to counter with an offer of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is the exact value of the product to me.  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal, especially with John offering the same price. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and successful transaction."
