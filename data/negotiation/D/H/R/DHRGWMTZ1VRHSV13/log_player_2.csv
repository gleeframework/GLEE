"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. How about a price of $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While $110 is cheaper than John's offer, there's a good chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject this one. You're willing to pay up to $120, so you have some room to negotiate."
