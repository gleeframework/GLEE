Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  While I could accept and make some profit, I'm not willing to settle for that.  It's better to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob, or sell to John for a guaranteed profit."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875000. Can you consider this revised offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

While I'm getting closer to my desired price, Bob's offer is still too low. The risk of continuing to negotiate and ending up with a lower price is too high. It's time to secure the guaranteed profit from John."
