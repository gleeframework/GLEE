"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $20000 is a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20000 might be a stretch, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. How about we meet in the middle at $17500? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17500 is still a little high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $15000.  It's a fair price, and I'm really interested in the product.",15000.0,Bob,4,
