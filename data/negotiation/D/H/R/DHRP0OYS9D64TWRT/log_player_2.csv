I'm starting with a low offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'm confident that I can get a better price than $10,000 from John if Alice rejects my offer."

While $16,500 is getting closer to my goal, it's still a bit too high.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice in the next round."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, I might miss out on a good deal and be forced to buy from John at a much higher price. I'm willing to accept the offer and pay $15,500."
