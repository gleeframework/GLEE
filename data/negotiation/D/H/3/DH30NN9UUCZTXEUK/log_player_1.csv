"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. Since the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, I'm leaving room for negotiation while still getting a good price.  I'm confident I can make a deal with Bob, but I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price. It's a risk, but I'm not desperate to sell yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to compromise a bit and offer $10,500. This is still a good profit for me, and it might be enough to convince Bob. I'm hoping he'll see that I'm serious about getting a good price and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. Although I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I still want to see if I can get closer to $10,000. I'm not willing to settle for $9,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to drop my price to $10,000. This is my minimum price, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, but I'm still confident that I can get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I've been trying to compromise, but at this point, I'm worried about getting stuck with a price that's too low. It's better to cut my losses and sell to John for $10,000.  It's not my ideal outcome, but it's still a decent profit."
