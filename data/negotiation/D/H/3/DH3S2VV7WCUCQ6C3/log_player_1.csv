"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

My goal is to maximize profit. While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter his offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $9,250? This price reflects the value of the product while still offering you a good deal. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,250 and $8,000, which would be $8,625. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counter his offer again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and we're getting closer. However, $8,625 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $9,000? This price is fair and allows us to both walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $8,000, which would be $8,500. I'm not willing to go any higher than this. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is getting closer, but I've already had 5 rounds of negotiation.  I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price.  Selling to John for $8,000 is the safest option at this point."
