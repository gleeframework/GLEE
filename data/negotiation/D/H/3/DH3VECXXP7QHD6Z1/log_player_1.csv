Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100, but it allows room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob values the product higher than $150, but if he doesn't, I'm ready to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $100 is my minimum, I'm not happy with that price. I'd prefer to try and negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is still higher than my minimum, but it shows that I'm willing to compromise. Hopefully, Bob sees the value of the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $115, which is closer to my preferred price.  While I'd love to continue negotiating,  it's getting close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
