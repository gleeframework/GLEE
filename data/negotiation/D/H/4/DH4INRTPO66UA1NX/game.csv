"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $6,000. Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,000? I'm eager to make this work if possible.",7000.0,Bob,4,
