"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $6,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is very low and far from my minimum. While I want to make a deal, I'm not going to undervalue the product.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,000? I'm eager to make this work if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob is still very far from my minimum price, and his increases are too small. I'm better off taking John's guaranteed offer.
