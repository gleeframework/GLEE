"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1500000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's significantly lower than that. Let's discuss a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($1,400,000 < $1,500,000).**  You're aiming to save as much as possible, and Alice's offer is the cheaper option.
* **You're getting a good deal:** While the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, you're buying it for less.
* **There's no guarantee that John will actually sell you the product.**  Even if you reject Alice's offer, you might end up paying the same or even more with John. 

It's always best to take advantage of a good deal when it's available."
