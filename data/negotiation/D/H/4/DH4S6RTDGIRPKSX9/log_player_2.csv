"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you this product. I believe it could be highly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm initially offering it at $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives us room to negotiate while still staying well below our $15,000 walk-away point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to find a fair deal, $11,000 is below its true value.  Could you consider $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate. We'll reject this offer and propose a price closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

We're now proposing a price directly in between our last offer and Alice's counteroffer. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
