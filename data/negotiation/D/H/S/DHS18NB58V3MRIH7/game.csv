,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1150000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm happy to purchase the product for $1050000, which would still be a good profit for you and a fair price for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1050000 doesn't reflect the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which is still a great deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle on this.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $1100000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1075000. This would be a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution we both agree on.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm happy to compromise, $1075000 doesn't fully reflect the product's value.  I'm willing to go down to $1090000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
