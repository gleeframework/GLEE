"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1500000, and I'm willing to make a compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1300000? This price still offers you significant value, and it's a fair reflection of the product's true worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $1250000 is getting closer, I'm still not able to accept it.  I'm willing to come down to $1275000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and it's a price that would still provide you with a strong return on your investment.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
