{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of significant value to your business.  I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1500000, and I'm willing to make a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm confident I can get a better price, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can squeeze out a better deal. There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can secure a more favorable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $1,250,000 is getting closer, I'm still not able to accept it.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and it's a price that would still provide you with a strong return on your investment.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to pay $1260000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1500000, and I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,260,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,260,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,260,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I would prefer a higher price, accepting this offer secures a profit for me and avoids the risk of further negotiations. With only 4 rounds remaining, the odds of getting a better offer from Bob are diminishing, and selling to John for $1,000,000 would result in a lower profit. Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice at this point in the negotiation."
