"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for cheaper from John.  There's no need to negotiate further with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $850,000?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there.  $850,000 is a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000?  Let's get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Although Alice is getting closer to Bob's price, it's still above his target and there's no guarantee she'll budge further.  Buying from John guarantees Bob gets the product for the lowest price."
