"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value the product at more than $1800000, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  I'm willing to reduce my price to $1900000. This still allows me to get a fair return on my investment, while offering you a significant discount.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1700000 is simply too low for me to consider at this point.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1800000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this offer.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
