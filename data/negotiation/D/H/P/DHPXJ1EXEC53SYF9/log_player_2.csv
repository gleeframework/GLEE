"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, you can likely get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to start a negotiation process and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  How about $95?  That would be a great price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $110. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, you can still do better. You're willing to spend up to $150 and Alice is willing to sell for $80, so there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially get the product for a price closer to your ideal range."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can agree on that."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not ready to go down to $100 yet. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $105. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $105, which is within your budget and significantly lower than what John is selling it for.  While you could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away from the deal.  Accepting her offer ensures you get the product for a good price without risking losing it altogether."
