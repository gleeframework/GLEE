Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a significant discount to consider it. How about we start at $600,000?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but my product is worth significantly more than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer, but $1,100,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can go up to $700,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is still well below the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need a price closer to $900,000 to make this deal work.  This is my final offer before I consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is holding firm at a price point significantly higher than your backup option with John.  Her language suggests she may be getting ready to walk away, making the risk of continuing negotiations higher than simply securing the product from John at your target price."
