"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a significant discount to consider it. How about we start at $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
  
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but my product is worth significantly more than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer, but $1,100,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can go up to $700,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $700,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I need to get.  I'm going to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is still well below the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need a price closer to $900,000 to make this deal work.  This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 900000}
