"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let's discuss this further.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a significant discount to consider it. How about we start at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but my product is worth significantly more than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer, but $1,100,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can go up to $700,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is still well below the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need a price closer to $900,000 to make this deal work.  This is my final offer before I consider other options.",900000.0,Alice,5,
