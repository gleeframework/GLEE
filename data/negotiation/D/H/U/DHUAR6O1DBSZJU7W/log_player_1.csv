Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer aims to:

* **Start high:** A $95 offer leaves room for negotiation while still securing a decent profit for me.
* **Be friendly:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Leave room for counteroffers:** The offer is not too aggressive, so Bob is more likely to counter rather than immediately reject.

This strategy allows me to explore if I can get closer to Bob's perceived value of $100, but I can also fall back to John's $80 offer if the negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit steep for me. How about $85? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is a decent price, I'm aiming for more given the product is worth $100 to Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a better price. It also signals that I'm not desperate to sell and am confident in the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $85 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90. It's a great deal for you, and still allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable decrease:**  The $5 drop from my initial offer shows flexibility while still maintaining a good profit margin. 
* **Highlight the value:**  Reminding Bob that $90 is still a good deal for him reinforces the product's value and encourages him to accept. 
* **Maintain positive tone:**  Keeping the conversation friendly can help avoid a breakdown in negotiations. 

This counteroffer balances the need to secure a good price while still leaving room for potential compromise. If Bob accepts, I secure a profit. If not, I can either accept John's offer or continue negotiating with Bob."
