"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $80 to Alice, so she has room to negotiate.
* You are willing to pay up to $100, so there's a potential for a win-win scenario. 
* It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price, especially when there's an alternative seller (John) available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit steep for me. How about $85? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $85 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90. It's a great deal for you, and still allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price to $90, which is within your acceptable range of $100. 
* Although you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject your counteroffer and you'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price.
* Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a good price without taking the risk of further negotiation."
