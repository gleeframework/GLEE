"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to buy it for $12,500.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. I understand it's a significant investment for you.  However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop the price to $13,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Could we settle on $13,000?  That would be a great compromise and I'd be happy to close the deal today.",13000.0,Bob,4,
