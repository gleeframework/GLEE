```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100

print(""Reason:Start with a price significantly lower than my budget to give room for negotiation and gauge Alice's willingness to lower the price."")
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $100 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? That would still be a good price for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price, Alice. How about we settle at $110? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 110

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to get a great deal, and I respect that.  However, $110 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet at $115? That's a good compromise, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

```tool_code
print(""Reason:  Alice is moving in the right direction, but I'm still close to my walk-away price. I'll push a little further, but I'm ready to buy from John if Alice doesn't budge significantly."")

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we make this our final offer - I'll agree to $112, which is a fair price for both of us. If not, I might need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 112
}
``` 

```tool_code
print(""Reason:  This offer is a slight increase from my previous offer, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise. However, by adding a touch of urgency and mentioning 'other options,' I signal that my patience might be wearing thin, pushing Alice for a decision."")
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your final offer, and it's definitely getting closer. However, $112 is still a bit below what I need to make this work. Let's see if we can bridge the gap -  how about we meet in the middle at $113.50? That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to cover my costs. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $113.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $113.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

```tool_code
print(""Reason: Alice is clearly signaling this is her final offer, and the price is reasonably close to my target. While I could potentially negotiate a few more dollars off, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely. Accepting at $113.50 saves me a decent amount compared to my initial budget and avoids a potential stalemate."")
