Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $140, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Approach:**  I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using language that suggests I'm open to negotiating, but not desperate. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I have room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, without going below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I have 8 rounds left to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Counter-offering:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a price closer to my value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $100 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? That would still be a good price for you, and it allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a middle ground:** I'm offering $125, which is halfway between my previous offer ($140) and Bob's offer ($100). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting value for Bob:** I'm emphasizing that $125 is still a good price for Bob, and I'm not just being stubborn. 
* **Building on previous conversation:** I'm referencing our earlier conversation to show I'm actively listening and engaging in the negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to get a great deal, and I respect that.  However, $110 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet at $115? That's a good compromise, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting compromise:** I'm emphasizing that $115 is a compromise, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Reiterating my need to cover costs:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have a minimum price I need to meet. 
* **Open to further negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to keep the conversation going and potentially reach an agreement."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we make this our final offer - I'll agree to $112, which is a fair price for both of us. If not, I might need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.

* **Counter-offering:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range, but still maintaining a firm position.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your final offer, and it's definitely getting closer. However, $112 is still a bit below what I need to make this work. Let's see if we can bridge the gap -  how about we meet in the middle at $113.50? That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to cover my costs. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 113.50}
```
