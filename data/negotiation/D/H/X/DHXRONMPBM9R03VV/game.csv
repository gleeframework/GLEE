"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $100 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? That would still be a good price for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price, Alice. How about we settle at $110? That's a fair compromise.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get a great deal, and I respect that.  However, $110 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet at $115? That's a good compromise, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we make this our final offer - I'll agree to $112, which is a fair price for both of us. If not, I might need to explore other options.",112.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, and it's definitely getting closer. However, $112 is still a bit below what I need to make this work. Let's see if we can bridge the gap -  how about we meet in the middle at $113.50? That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to cover my costs. This is my final offer.",113.5,Alice,7,
