"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think you'll love it just as much as I do. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $800000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:  Alice's offer of $750,000 is lower than the product's value to you ($800,000) and also lower than John's price ($800,000).  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $50,000."
