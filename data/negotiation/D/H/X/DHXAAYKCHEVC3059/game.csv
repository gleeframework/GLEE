"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I've done some research and I'm not sure it's worth the full $18,000. Can you meet me at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, however,  $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but need to stay above $15,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,500?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",13000.0,Bob,4,
