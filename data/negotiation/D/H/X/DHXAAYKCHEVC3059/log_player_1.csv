Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I've done some research and I'm not sure it's worth the full $18,000. Can you meet me at $12,000?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, however,  $12,000 is significantly below its true value.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you consider this price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Bob is not budging much and we are still too far apart. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation.  Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price."
