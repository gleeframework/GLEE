"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,700,000 for this product.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1700000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm not comfortable going above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not enough. I am confident that I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is tempting, but I want to explore if I can get closer to that price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm not willing to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll meet you at $1,350,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target price.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option, but I'd rather see if I can close the deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find a solution. While $1,350,000 is tempting, I need to stay closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1450000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'm not going any higher. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I've already made several concessions and it seems unlikely that Bob will budge further.  At this point, it's more beneficial to sell the product to John for $1,500,000 and secure a price that meets my minimum requirements.  The risk of further negotiations with Bob is too high, and I don't want to waste more time pursuing a deal that's unlikely to materialize."
