"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,700,000 for this product.  Let's find a middle ground.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm not comfortable going above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm not willing to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll meet you at $1,350,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find a solution. While $1,350,000 is tempting, I need to stay closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome.  Let's make this happen.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'm not going any higher. This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
