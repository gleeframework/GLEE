{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me, and I think it's worth a lot to you as well.  I'm offering it to you for $13,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get as close to my desired price of $12,000 as possible.  I'll be ready to negotiate further if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey at $13,000. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $11,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired $12,000 by continuing the negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm going to counter with a price that's in the middle between my desired price and Bob's offer. This shows good faith while still getting closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $11,500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,250. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit lower than my ideal price, it's getting close.  I think it's time to close the deal and not risk losing the sale to John."
