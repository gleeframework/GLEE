Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob. He gets a discount compared to your other buyer, and you get a higher profit than his perceived value.
* **Limited-Time Pressure:**  Mentioning other interested parties adds a level of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly."
