"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $85. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
