"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further.  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer you $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial proposal.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This would still give you a great deal, and it's a fair price considering the value this product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's less than his maximum price of $1,200,000 and closer to his initial counteroffer of $900,000.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but it risks losing the deal entirely. It's also worth noting that Alice is willing to negotiate, which suggests she's motivated to sell the product. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price while avoiding any further risk."
