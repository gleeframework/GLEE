{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially earning a bit more than my minimum. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $8,250? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $7,800? I think that's a reasonable compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $7,800 is still below my minimum price of $8,000. While I could try to negotiate further, I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better price from Bob. To avoid risking a prolonged negotiation and potentially getting stuck with a lower price, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $8,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
