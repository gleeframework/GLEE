"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my desired value, I'm willing to come down a bit further. Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000.  This price still offers you a good deal, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
