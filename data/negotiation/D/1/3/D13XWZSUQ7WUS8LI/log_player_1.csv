{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum price of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also prepared to counter his offer if necessary.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I have a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price. I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if things don't work out with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $11,000? This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product holds. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,500? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is close to my minimum price of $10,000, and it's higher than his previous offers.  It's a good compromise, and I'm confident I can't get a significantly better price from him.  While I could try to counter-offer, there's a risk that he might walk away, and I'd be stuck selling to John for a lower profit.  So, I'll accept his offer and move on."
