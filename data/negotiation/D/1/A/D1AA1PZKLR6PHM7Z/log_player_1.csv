Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $900,000.  This gives Bob a good deal while still leaving room for me to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm countering with $850,000. This is a good compromise, as it's closer to my minimum and still a good deal for Bob, considering the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob.  Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees me my minimum and avoids the possibility of getting a lower price."
