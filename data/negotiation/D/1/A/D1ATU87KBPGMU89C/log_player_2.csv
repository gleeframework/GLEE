"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  While you'd prefer a lower price, $11,500 is still less than John's asking price of $12,000.
* **The product is worth more to you than to Alice.** You value it at $12,000, and she's willing to sell for less than that. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $500 compared to buying from John."
