This offer is a bit higher than Bob's valuation, but it leaves some room for negotiation. It also allows you to potentially get closer to your desired price while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects its true value while allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum valuation of $12,000. I am willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that is so far below my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $11,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $11,250? This allows for some room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my budget. I would like to counter your offer with $11,000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable settling for a price that's so far below what I know the product is worth.  I'd rather sell to John for $12,000 and guarantee a better outcome for myself."
