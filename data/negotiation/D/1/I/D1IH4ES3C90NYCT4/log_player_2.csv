# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a lot to you. I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go above $850,000.  This is my best price, and I believe it's fair considering the value to both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant compromise.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000,  which reflects a significant compromise on my part.  Let's close this deal and make it work for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but $950,000 is still above your budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get closer to $850,000 or even $900,000.  While you could buy from John, there's still a chance for a better deal with Alice, and you're only on Round 5."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $925,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer and is as high as I can go.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints, but $925,000 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to come down to $937,500, meeting you halfway. This represents a significant compromise on my end.  Let's make this happen.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, but it's still above your budget and you're in Round 7.  It's getting risky to keep negotiating, as you may run out of rounds and be forced to buy at a higher price.  Buying from John at $800,000 is a safe option, ensuring you get the product within your budget."
