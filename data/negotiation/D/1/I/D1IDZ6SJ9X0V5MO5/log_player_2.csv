**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still too high.  I'm going to continue to negotiate with Alice to try and get a better price.  I still have time and can always buy from John if needed."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Explanation:**

Alice is still not willing to budge significantly. I've reached my maximum budget, and while I'm only $5 over with Alice's offer, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation. Buying from John guarantees me the product at my maximum price and prevents any further wasted time."
