"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you taking the time to explain its value.  While it's a great product, that price point is a little high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $700,000. After re-evaluating the market and considering your interest, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this incredible technology.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant at $850,000.  How about we settle at $775,000?  That would allow me to make the investment while staying within a comfortable budget.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another adjustment to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to make this compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me on this.  $825,000 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $800,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product while working for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
