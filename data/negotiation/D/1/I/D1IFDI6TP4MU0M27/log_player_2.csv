{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get an even better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $10,000. I'm offering a price slightly above her value, hoping she'll accept to close the deal quickly.  This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and it allows for potential compromise if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my desired price, and it's only $200 less than what John is selling it for. I'm still willing to negotiate with Alice, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for my target price. I'm increasing my offer from the previous round, but still keeping it below her last offer and closer to my target. This shows I'm serious about buying the product and willing to compromise, while also creating an opportunity for a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,200 is higher than what John is selling the product for. This means there's no chance of getting a better deal from Alice.  Buying from John is the best option to ensure I get the product within my budget."
