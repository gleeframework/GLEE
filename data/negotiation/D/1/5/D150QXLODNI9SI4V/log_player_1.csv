"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price well above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly from the initial offer, but still remaining above my minimum. This shows flexibility while maintaining my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round. I'm running out of rounds, but I want to avoid selling to John if possible, as I'd prefer a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm dropping my price again, but only slightly. This shows continued flexibility, while still leaving room for some potential negotiation.  With only 5 rounds left, I need to strike a balance between being firm and making concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm only down to 4 rounds, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my goal. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm dropping my price one last time, hoping to meet Bob halfway.  With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to be more flexible while still aiming for a price that's closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, it's unlikely I'll get a price close to my desired amount. Bob is clearly unwilling to go much higher.  To avoid losing out on a guaranteed profit, I'll sell to John."
