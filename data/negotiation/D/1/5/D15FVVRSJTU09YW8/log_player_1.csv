Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer Alice could send to Bob:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,400,000. I know you recognize the immense value this brings, and I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible. Offering a price significantly lower ($1,200,000) leaves money on the table.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, still landing Alice a great deal. 
* **Confidence and Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of why he's interested. This can make a high price more palatable.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might start even higher to create more bargaining space.
* **Market Information:** If Alice is aware of other potential buyers besides John, she might be bolder in her offer to Bob.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If Alice needs to sell quickly, she might be slightly more flexible on price."
