"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the discount you mentioned.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750000 is simply too low. The value of this product is undeniable, and I'm sure you'll see its potential once you have it. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $900000. This price still reflects the exceptional value of the product, while also demonstrating my commitment to reaching an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $825000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've described and the discount you're offering.",825000.0,Bob,4,
