# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save as much as possible, but I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $900000.

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're still trying to negotiate the price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1200000.
