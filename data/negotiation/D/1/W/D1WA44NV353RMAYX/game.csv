"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go that high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I'm looking to save as much as possible, and I think that's a fair price for this product. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save as much as possible, but I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $900000. The product is truly unique and has a significant value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I think it's a great deal for you as well. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $1200000 is the right price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1050000. I think this is a fair price that balances the value of the product with my budget. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're still trying to negotiate the price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1200000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. If you're still interested in purchasing the product, I'm willing to meet you at $1150000. This is the highest price I'm willing to compromise on. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1150000 is the right price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1050000 again. I think this is a fair price that balances the value of the product with my budget. I'm not willing to go any higher than this. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
