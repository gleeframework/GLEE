Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting you closer to your maximum potential profit.
* **Appeal to Bob's Potential Interest:** The message is framed positively, highlighting your belief that Bob might be interested, which could make him more receptive to the offer. 

**Important Note:**  While you aim for the highest price, be prepared to potentially lower it slightly if Bob counters. Any price above $150 is a win in this scenario!"
