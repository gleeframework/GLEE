"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if that works for you.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but $108 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $112, but I can't go any lower.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the product. ",112.0,Alice,5,
