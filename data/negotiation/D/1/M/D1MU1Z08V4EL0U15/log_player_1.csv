Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it would be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($150) without going over.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you make a significant profit.
* **Consider the Alternative:** While John offers a safety net at $120, securing a deal with Bob at $140 is much more profitable."
