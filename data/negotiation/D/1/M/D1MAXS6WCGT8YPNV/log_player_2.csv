"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product, which holds immense value for you at $10,000. I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $9,500. This is a special opportunity to secure a high-quality item at a price that is just a little below its true worth. I believe this is a fair deal and hope we can come to an agreement. Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000. Since you can get the product for $10,000 from John, rejecting Alice's offer is the best option to save money. You can try to negotiate further with Alice, but for now, rejecting her offer keeps your options open."
