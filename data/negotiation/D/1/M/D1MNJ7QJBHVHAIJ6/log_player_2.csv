"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for less than $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John at this point is not a good option as it is above Bob's maximum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $10,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and is still within Bob's budget. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while staying within his price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  Alice's offer is lower than her previous offer, but still above Bob's desired price.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob more time to negotiate and potentially get the product for a better price.  Buying from John is still too expensive at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway. Offering $11,000 is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's current offer. It shows Bob is willing to be flexible while still aiming for a price closer to his desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,200 is only slightly higher than Bob's last counteroffer of $11,000.  Since Bob has a limited number of rounds and John's offer is significantly higher, it's  advantageous to accept Alice's offer and secure the product. Bob is still able to buy the product for a price he is comfortable with while avoiding the risk of losing the deal."
