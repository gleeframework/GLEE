"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than what you're offering. Considering your willingness to pay $10,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,250 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about we settle on $10,750? This price reflects a fair compromise and gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can finalize this.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,750. Considering your willingness to pay $10,750, I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $11,100. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",11100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down again, but $11,100 is still a bit too high.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $10,750. It's a fair price that benefits both of us, and I believe it's the best way to reach an agreement quickly. What do you say?",10750.0,Bob,6,
