Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he counters. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:** While $140 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($80), it's close enough to potentially entice him, especially if the product is something he desires. 
* **Above Minimum:**  This offer ensures you make a profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly. You always have the safety net of selling to John for your minimum price."
