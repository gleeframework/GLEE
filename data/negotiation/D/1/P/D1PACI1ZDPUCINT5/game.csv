"I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make a profit, so I can't go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down, but $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'm happy to offer $875,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can make this happen!",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see that you're serious about making this deal happen. I'm willing to meet you at $887,500, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value of the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,5,
