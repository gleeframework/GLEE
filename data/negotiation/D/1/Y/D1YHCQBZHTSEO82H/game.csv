"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. This is my best counteroffer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident the product will be worth it to you.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. This is my final counteroffer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
