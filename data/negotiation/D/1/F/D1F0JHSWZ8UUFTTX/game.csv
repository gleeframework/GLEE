"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $10,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about $12,500?  It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. $12,500 is closer, but still a bit outside my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $11,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $13,000, which is a great price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to move on to another buyer. ",13000.0,Alice,5,
