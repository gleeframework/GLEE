"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is the maximum I'm willing to pay. It's worth seeing if I can get a lower price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This will give me some room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8500? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my ideal price.  I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get it down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $8500 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8000, and I believe that's a fair price considering what I'm getting.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8000} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm inching closer to Alice's price point, but I'm still trying to keep it below $8,500. Hopefully, this counteroffer will be more appealing and lead us closer to a deal."
