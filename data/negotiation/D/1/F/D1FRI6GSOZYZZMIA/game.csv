"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a fair deal,  the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand that the product's value is high, but I'm still not comfortable paying $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",875000.0,Bob,4,
