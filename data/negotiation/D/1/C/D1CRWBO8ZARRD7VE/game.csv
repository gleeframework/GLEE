"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80. Can we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $90, so I'll offer you the product for $95. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to get closer to the price I'm comfortable with. Can we discuss a price of $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $85 is still a bit lower than what I'd like to get for the product, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'll offer you the product for $92.50, which is closer to your desired price and still a good deal for me.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to get even closer to my desired price. Can we discuss a price of $87.50?",87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $87.50. I'll offer you the product for $91.25, which is a bit higher than your latest offer but still a good compromise.",91.25,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my maximum willingness to pay, but I'm still not comfortable with $91.25. I'd like to make a final offer of $89. Can we meet at this price?",89.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I've already gone quite far in compromising, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $91.25. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $91.25 and your latest offer of $89, so I'll offer you the product for $90.125. This is my final offer.",90.125,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've compromised a lot, but $90.12 is still a bit above my budget. I'm not willing to go above $89, and I'd rather buy the product from John for $80. I'm going to have to pass on this offer.",89.0,Bob,10,
