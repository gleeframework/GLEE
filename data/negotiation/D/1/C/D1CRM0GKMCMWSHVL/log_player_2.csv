"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay, it's always a good idea to try and negotiate a better price. Rejecting the first offer allows me to explore if I can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 6.25% discount. This should hopefully make Alice consider lowering her price, especially since she's willing to sell for $8,000.  We'll see how she responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $7,800, which is only a $200 difference from my initial counteroffer. It's worth accepting this offer since it's within my budget and saves me $200 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might lead to a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting my next counteroffer and the potential of going back and forth for more rounds isn't worth the potential small saving."
