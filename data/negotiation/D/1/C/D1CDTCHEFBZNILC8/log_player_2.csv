Bob should reject the offer. He can still get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no need to accept Alice's offer of $9,000. There's still room to negotiate with Alice."

This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you.  Let's make this deal happen!

Bob should buy the product from John.  While Alice has come down significantly, the price is still above Bob's target of $8,000. Since he can get the product from John for his target price, there's no need to continue negotiating with Alice."
