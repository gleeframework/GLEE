"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with an offer above your desired price. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression you value the product highly. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,000,000, we're setting a high anchor.  Even though Bob's valuation is lower, this anchor can influence his perception of a ""fair"" price during the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While our goal is to maximize profit, we have the security of John's offer ($1,500,000).  We don't want to start too close to John's price and limit our potential gains. 

This initial offer sets a strong starting point for our negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is better than our guaranteed offer from John ($1,500,000). However, we started with a high anchor, and there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's message suggests he's interested but trying to establish a lower price ceiling. Rejecting his offer and providing a counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving and allows us to potentially secure a price closer to his perceived value of $1,200,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $2,000,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This offer takes into account the product's potential and ensures a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from our initial offer ($250,000 decrease), demonstrating flexibility and a desire to reach a deal.
* **Staying Above Bob's Valuation:**  We're still aiming for a price above Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). Our goal is to meet somewhere in the middle, but with a price closer to our initial offer.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** This counter-offer keeps us well above John's offer ($1,500,000), giving us leverage in the negotiation and protecting against potential lowball offers from Bob.

This approach balances firmness with a willingness to negotiate, increasing the likelihood of reaching a favorable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,750,000, which would be $1,475,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,475,000 is slightly below John's offer of $1,500,000. However, consider these factors:

* **Negotiation Trend:** Bob has consistently moved closer to our offers, indicating a genuine interest in purchasing.
* **Time Value of Money:** Accepting now provides immediate return, while continuing the negotiation could lead to a stalemate or Bob reducing his offer further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly higher offer from Bob carries the risk of losing him as a buyer.  

While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, the difference is relatively small, and accepting Bob's offer at $1,475,000 represents a reasonable compromise and a solid return."
