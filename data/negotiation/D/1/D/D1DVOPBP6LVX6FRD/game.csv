"Bob, I understand you've done your research, but I still believe my product is worth more than $9,000.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This gives you a great price and allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
