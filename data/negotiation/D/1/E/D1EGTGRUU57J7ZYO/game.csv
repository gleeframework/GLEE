"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be immensely valuable to you.  Given its unique benefits, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussion.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd like to propose a price of $1,050,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for us to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a significant gap from what I believe the product is worth.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,125,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can close the deal at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
