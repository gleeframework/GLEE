Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $180.  Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $180, knowing it's well above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** I'm not starting at my absolute minimum ($150) because I want to leave room for Bob to counter-offer, giving me a chance to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's worth less than you think. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's better than nothing, $120 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a price that's closer to my desired range.  
* **Seeking a better deal:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that might be more attractive to him while still getting closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $150?  That would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to sell the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that is exactly halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($150) and Bob's offer ($120). This shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits for Bob by highlighting that $150 is still a good deal. 
* **Direct question:** I'm ending with a direct question to encourage Bob to respond and potentially accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable paying $150. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will refuse to budge further, leaving me with no choice but to sell for less than I want.
* **Guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the potential for a lower sale price or a prolonged negotiation with Bob."
