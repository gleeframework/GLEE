"Thank you for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this item.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  However, $11500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. To finalize this deal, I'm sticking to my previous offer of $10000.  I believe this price is fair given the value we both see in the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to stick to your budget. However, I'm not willing to go below $12000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it still reflects the value the product holds. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you be willing to consider $11500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
