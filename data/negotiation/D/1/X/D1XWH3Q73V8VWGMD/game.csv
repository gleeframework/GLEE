"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me in the middle at $10000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $10500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $10500 is a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $9000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9000 is still a little too low for me. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to go down to $9500.  This is a good compromise, and it allows us to both walk away feeling satisfied. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $9500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $9500, so how about we try $9250? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,6,
