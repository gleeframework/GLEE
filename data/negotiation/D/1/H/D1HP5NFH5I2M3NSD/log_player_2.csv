Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're getting close to your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $675,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $675,000, which would be $687,500. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $687,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $687,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit, and while she might go slightly lower, it's unlikely she'll drop significantly in the next three rounds. $687,500 is a reasonably good deal, saving you over $300,000 from your maximum budget and a decent amount from John's offer. Holding out for a slightly better deal might not be worth the risk of Alice increasing her price or the negotiation failing."
