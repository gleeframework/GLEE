"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider this price?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind.  Could you do $17,000? That feels like a fairer compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
