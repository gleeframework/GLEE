``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than your minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation. This way, Bob is more likely to accept your offer or counter with a price that's still within your desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below your desired price.  You should reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to your desired range."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is tempting, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000. This would still be a great deal for you, given the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a more reasonable price. Would you be willing to consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to your minimum price, it's still significantly below your desired range. You should reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to $1,100,000, potentially offering a small concession to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $950,000 is tempting, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price is still fair, given the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, it seems like Bob is unwilling to meet your desired price range. You've already made multiple concessions, and it's likely that the negotiations will continue to go back and forth without a satisfactory outcome. It's time to cut your losses and take the surefire deal with John for $1,500,000."
