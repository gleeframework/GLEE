"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $1500000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to maximize my savings.  I'm willing to pay $1350000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1475000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",1475000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1475000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, which is a significant compromise on my part. This would be a win-win for both of us, allowing me to get a good deal and you to secure a sale. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not willing to go down to $1400000. I'm willing to meet you at $1420000, which is a compromise from my previous offer. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair price for the product considering its value to you. What do you think?",1420000.0,Alice,5,
