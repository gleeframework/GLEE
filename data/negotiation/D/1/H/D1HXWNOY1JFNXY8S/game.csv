"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit lower than where I need to be. Let's split the difference. How about $10,500? I'm confident this price is still very fair considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit away from a price that works for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but  $9,750 is still too low. How about $10,000? This feels like a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away happy.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,6,
