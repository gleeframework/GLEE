Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I still need to make a decent profit. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not going to give up yet, Bob! I'll meet you at $112. That's the lowest I can go, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower. Accepting at $112 is a decent deal and further haggling risks losing the opportunity for a price below John's $150 offer."
