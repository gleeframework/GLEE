Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $10,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering a price above Bob's perceived value, I can gauge his level of interest. If he flat out rejects it, I know he might not be willing to go much higher than $8,000. If he counters, it opens up a negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:**  I have the security of John's offer at $8,000, which is my minimum. This allows me to be more assertive in my negotiation with Bob."
