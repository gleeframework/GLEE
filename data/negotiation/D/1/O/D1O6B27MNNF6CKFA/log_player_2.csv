"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $10,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $14,000? It's a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for coming down, Alice. While $14,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $11,500? I think that's a fair price that meets both of us closer to the middle."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $13,500? It's a fair price that still gives me some room for profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're getting close, but Alice is still significantly above John's price. We're in Round 5, so we have time for a few more counteroffers before we need to consider John seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to move up a bit more to show I'm serious. How about $12,000 even? That's the absolute highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Reaching our limit:** $12,000 is our maximum budget. This offer signals to Alice that we're serious but also at our limit.
* **Putting pressure:** By stating it's our ""absolute highest,"" we encourage her to accept rather than risk losing the sale.  
* **Alternative is real:**  We're still several rounds away from John being our only option, but Alice doesn't need to know that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to move up, Bob, but $12,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and my minimum price of $15,000. How about $13,750? It's a fair price that should satisfy both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice is stuck on her ""minimum"" of $15,000, and we've hit our absolute top at $12,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to close the gap.
* **Time pressure:**  We're now in Round 7. While we have a few rounds left, continuing risks Alice becoming more firm on her price, leaving us with no choice but John at the last minute.
* **Guaranteed Savings:** John's offer is guaranteed, saving us $1,750 over Alice's latest offer.  It's worth taking the sure thing at this point."
