"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the product's minimum value.

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear that I'm willing to compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1080000. I think that's the lowest price I can reasonably accept. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. I'm not willing to sell the product for $1000000, as I think it's below its true value. What's it going to be?",1080000.0,Alice,9,
