Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $20,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start the negotiation with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a profitable outcome.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's reaction to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and his perceived value of the product. 
* **Alternative Option:** Remember, you always have John as a backup buyer, so you don't feel pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $15,000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $15,000 matches John's standing offer.  While we could try to negotiate with Bob further, there's no guarantee he'll go higher. Accepting John's offer ensures we get our minimum acceptable price ($15,000) without the risk of further negotiation potentially failing."
