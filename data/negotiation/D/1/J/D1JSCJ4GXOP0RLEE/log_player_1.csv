Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding my minimum price ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring I make a profit if he accepts outright. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale with John at $150 gives me leverage. I don't need to desperately lowball Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and ensuring a guaranteed sale at a price acceptable to me."
