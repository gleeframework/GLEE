"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the enthusiasm behind it. However, I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $75 just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $82.50? It's a compromise that still benefits both of us.",82.5,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand that we need to reach a fair agreement. I would like to propose a price of $80 for the product. This is my final offer, as I am aware that there is another seller willing to provide the product for that exact amount.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understanding of the market value. However, I'm still not willing to sell at $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $82.50 and $80, which would be $81.25. It's a small compromise, but I think it's worth considering.",81.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in trying to reach an agreement. However, I believe that $80 is the most I can afford for this product. Given that another seller is willing to provide the product for that exact amount, I would like to stick to my budget. Thank you for considering my offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
