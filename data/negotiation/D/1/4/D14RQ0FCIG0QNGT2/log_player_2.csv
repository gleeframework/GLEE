"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $100 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? This product is really worth it, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get at least $130 for this.  I'm confident it's worth that and more to you in the long run. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is very unlikely to go below $130, and we have a guaranteed option at $120 with John."
