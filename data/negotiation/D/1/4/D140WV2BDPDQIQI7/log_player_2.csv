You should reject Alice's offer. You are willing to pay up to $8,000, and her offer is significantly higher. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $8000, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price again."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your offer of $8000, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $9500. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  At this point, it's better to buy from John for $8,000. You've already made several counteroffers and it's likely that Alice won't go lower."
