{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a great asset for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer leaves room for negotiation, while still being significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. It's important to start high and see how much Bob is willing to negotiate. I'm also setting a clear expectation that I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not desperate to sell. This will give me a better position in the bargaining process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. It's a significant price drop from your original offer, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's worth exploring if we can bridge the gap, but I'm not willing to accept his offer right now. I will counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a significant price reduction from my initial offer. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

I'm adjusting my offer slightly to $1,350,000. This is still above Bob's offer but shows a willingness to compromise. I'm highlighting the price reduction from my initial offer to emphasize the value I'm offering.  I'm also focusing on the benefits for both of us, positioning this as a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,350,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is still too low, and we're getting closer to the point where the negotiations are taking too long. I'm confident that selling to John will secure a much better deal for me, as he's willing to pay my minimum asking price."
