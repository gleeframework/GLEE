"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but $85 is cutting it a bit too close for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  It's a fantastic product and well worth it.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $87.50? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",87.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us.  Let's make this final offer - $88.  It's a steal for a product this good and allows me to still feel good about the deal. What do you say?",88.0,Alice,5,
