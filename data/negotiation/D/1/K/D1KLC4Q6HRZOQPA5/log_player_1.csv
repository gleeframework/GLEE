Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $9,000.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $9,000 leaves a small buffer for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant gain for Alice.
* **Time Value & Certainty:**  Selling to Bob quickly at $9,000 might be preferable to the guaranteed $8,000 from John, even if Bob negotiates slightly down."
