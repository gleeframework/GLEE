Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and what his budget might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly below my desired profit margin.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, showing a willingness to compromise.  I believe this price is still fair considering the product's value to me, and it leaves room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price. While Bob's offer is closer to my desired profit, I'm not yet ready to settle.  I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer.  This price is a significant compromise on my end and reflects the potential risk of losing the deal with Bob. It's close enough to his last offer that I believe it shows my willingness to negotiate, while still allowing me to secure a profit that feels worthwhile."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to my fallback price with John.  Given the potential for further negotiation to be unproductive and the time investment already made, I'm accepting Bob's offer.  The profit margin is still decent, and it's time to secure the sale."
