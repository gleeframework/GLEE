Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing he values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves space for potential negotiation while still staying significantly above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""potential value"" to justify the high price and appeal to Bob's potential gain. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiation tactics or risk tolerance.
* There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer, and I'll have to settle for John's $1,000,000 offer. However, the potential reward of securing a higher price from Bob makes this risk worth taking."
