,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, as I believe it's a fair price reflecting its value and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind. This product offers significant long-term value that I'm confident you'll benefit from.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand the product's value, $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
