"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product at a price of $10000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth much more than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good price, it's still worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower.  We have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8000 is unfortunately below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $9000. This gives you a good price and allows me to reach a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is closer to my target of $8,000.  It's still a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing out on the product by continuing to negotiate.  There's a chance she might come down further, but it's not worth the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and potentially ending up with nothing."
