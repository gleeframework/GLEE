"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $22,000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, how about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $18,000 is still more than I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a fair compromise and a significant increase from my initial offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
