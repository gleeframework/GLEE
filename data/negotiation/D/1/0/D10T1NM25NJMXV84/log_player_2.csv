"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that could significantly enhance your business operations. Considering its value and benefits, I propose a price of $15,000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

This is a good starting point.  Alice's offer is way above your budget, so rejecting is the best option. You'll likely need to counteroffer significantly lower."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $15,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in this product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $12,000. This aligns closely with your budget while still reflecting the value we place on the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'll offer $11,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and my budget limitations.  Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is closer to your budget, but still above it. You can try to counteroffer one more time to see if you can get closer to your goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $11,250.  This is my final offer.  I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and respect your final offer. Considering the value of the product and our previous negotiations, I am willing to accept $11,375 as the final price for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While this is still above your ideal price, it's a good compromise. You're within a few hundred dollars of your budget and Alice is likely close to her minimum. You risk losing the deal if you reject again and go back and forth. Buying from John is a safe option, but you'll be getting a slightly lesser product for the same price."
