"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to maximize my potential profit while remaining competitive in the early stages of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. It's a bit above its value to you, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and leaves room for me to potentially get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $105?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better. How about we settle on $102.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $102.5 is close to my desired price. Since it's approaching my preferred outcome, and there are only a few rounds left, it's in my best interest to accept his offer and close the deal."
