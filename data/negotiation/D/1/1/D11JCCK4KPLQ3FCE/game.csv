"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $15,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $16,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $16,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford right now.  How about we split the difference and settle on $15,750?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",15750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,750 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",16250.0,Alice,5,
