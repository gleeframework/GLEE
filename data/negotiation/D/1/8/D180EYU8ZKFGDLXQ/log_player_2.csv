"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above Bob's budget of $800,000. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which reflects the value of the product and gives us both a fair deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob can still try to negotiate further, especially since he has a fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's try to find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is a good offer, but I need to get closer to $1,000,000 to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, $975,000 is still outside of it.  There are still rounds to go, so it makes sense to reject and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get closer to $1,000,000, but $975,000 is still pushing my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
