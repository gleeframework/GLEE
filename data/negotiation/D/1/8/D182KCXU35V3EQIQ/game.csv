"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $110 is a bit steep for me. How about $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $65 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $87.50?  Let me know what you think.",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $87.50 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  Could you do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 is still below my minimum. Let's try $80.  That's closer to my price, and a fair deal for both of us.",80.0,Alice,5,
