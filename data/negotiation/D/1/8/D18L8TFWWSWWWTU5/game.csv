"Thanks for offering, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?",70.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $90, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $80?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $92. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I still need to make a profit on this sale.",92.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm trying to make this work, but $92 is still too high for me.  I'd be willing to do $85, but that's my final offer.",85.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $92, which would be $88.50. That's the lowest I can go.",88.5,Alice,7,
