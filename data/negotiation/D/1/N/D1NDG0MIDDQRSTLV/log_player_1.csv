Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150 to leave room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:**  I'm framing the price as a ""great deal"" and highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Open to negotiation:** My message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer.

This approach balances maximizing my potential profit with keeping the negotiation open and increasing the chances of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, though. How about $100?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob is interested, he's clearly trying to negotiate a much lower price. I believe I can get a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **John is a backup:** Having John as a potential buyer gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob, knowing I can always sell to him for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's still above my minimum price ($150), but significantly lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not going to give the product away.
* **Appeal to fairness:** I'm framing the price as a ""meeting in the middle,"" suggesting a compromise that benefits both of us.
* **Maintain leverage:**  While I'm lowering my price, I'm still leaving room for further negotiation. 

This approach helps to move the negotiation forward while keeping my interests protected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $110.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can agree on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob is willing to increase his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks lowering my price even further, especially if he continues to counteroffer. 
* **John is the better option:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.  

It's a tough decision to walk away from a potential deal, but John offers a more secure and profitable outcome in this scenario."
