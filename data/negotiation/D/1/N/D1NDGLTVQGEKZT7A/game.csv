"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I need for this product. I understand you have a budget, so how about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This would still allow me to make a fair profit while giving you a great deal on a valuable product. Let me know your thoughts!",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my current budget constraints, I am proposing a price of $9,500 for the product. This allows us to find a mutually beneficial solution within my financial limits.",9500.0,Bob,4,
