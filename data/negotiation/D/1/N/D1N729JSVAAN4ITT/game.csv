"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $75?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $82? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $82 is still a little too high for me.  Would you consider $78?  It's closer to what I'm comfortable paying and still a fair price for the product.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $78. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $81? I think this is the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while.",81.0,Alice,5,
