Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and features, I'm initially offering it to you at a price of $20,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob's perceived value is $8,000, Alice has a strong alternative buyer (John) at $15,000. This allows her to start with a higher price than both Bob's valuation and John's offer. 
* **Negotiation Room:** The $20,000 offer leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving Alice the chance to reduce the price slightly while still staying above her minimum. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value to justify the high price, potentially influencing Bob's perception.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:** This strategy assumes Bob isn't extremely price-sensitive. If he's unwilling to negotiate, he might reject the offer outright.
* **Relationship:** If Alice values a long-term relationship with Bob, a less aggressive starting price might be more appropriate."
