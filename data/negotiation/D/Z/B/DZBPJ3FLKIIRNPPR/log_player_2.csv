"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $9,500, which is less than John's price of $12,000.
* **You can save money:**  By accepting Alice's offer, you save $2,500 compared to buying from John. 
* **The product is worth more to you than to Alice:** Since the product is worth $12,000 to you and only $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation, but this is still a good deal."
