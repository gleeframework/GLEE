Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my target price of at least $100. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.

Round 4

``` 

While $85 is getting closer to Bob's valuation, I'm still determined to get at least $90.  I'll counteroffer again.  It's worth pushing a little further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you on your budget, and I'm willing to make one last compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $90.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'm getting closer to my minimum price with Bob, it's not worth the risk of going through another round. John is guaranteed to buy for $100, which is more than what I'm currently getting from Bob, and I'm running out of time."
