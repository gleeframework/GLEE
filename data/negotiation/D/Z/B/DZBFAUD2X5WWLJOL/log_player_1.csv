Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's also above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm aiming for a good profit while keeping the deal attractive for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my desired profit. I'll try to push for a slightly higher price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,500 is a good compromise. While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a fair price and higher than what John is offering.  There's always a risk of further negotiations, and I don't want to lose out on this deal entirely."
