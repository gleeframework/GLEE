"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best price, and I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While your $1,200,000 offer is my minimum, I believe the value this product brings to you justifies a slightly higher price.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
