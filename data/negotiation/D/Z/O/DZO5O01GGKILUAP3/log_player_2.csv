"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. There's no reason to accept it when you can potentially get the product for less by negotiating further or buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. Considering your budget, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to your budget, but it's still higher than your maximum price point. Since John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000, it's worth rejecting Alice's offer and continuing to negotiate or going straight to John.  There's a good chance you can get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $950,000. It's a good deal for both of us. Let's settle on this price to save time and move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you halfway between $1050000 and $950000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1000000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is right at your budget limit. While it's tempting to try and negotiate further, it's not worth the risk. John is also offering the product for $1,000,000, and there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.  You can save yourself the time and effort by simply buying from John."
