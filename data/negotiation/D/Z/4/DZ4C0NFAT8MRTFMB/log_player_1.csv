{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation without immediately shutting down the deal. 
* **Optimistic but Realistic:** $1,100,000 is a decent starting point. It's a good chance Bob might be willing to pay that much for the product.
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers, which allows me to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response. If he rejects, I can counteroffer or move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for better outcome:**  Even though Bob might be the best option at this point, I can still try to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Exploring options:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer, potentially pushing the price closer to my target. If that fails, I can always sell to John for $1,200,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm open to selling it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising but not giving in:** I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still holding firm above Bob's offer, showing I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Fair Value:**  $1,050,000 is a fair compromise, giving Bob a good deal while still allowing me to earn a decent profit.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation, suggesting there's still room for compromise. If Bob rejects this offer, I can reconsider my options (selling to John or making another counteroffer)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Bob's offer of $980,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Risk of losing a better deal:** Accepting Bob's offer means losing out on the opportunity to sell to John for a higher price.
* **Opportunity for compromise:** Even though Bob seems to be at his limit, I can still try to negotiate a higher price. There's a chance he might be willing to go up slightly to avoid losing the deal entirely. 

I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  I'm still a bit away from where I need to be to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference.  How about $1,015,000? It's a fair price that bridges the gap between our positions.  I'm hopeful we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1015000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** While I've lowered my price again, I'm not dropping below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This shows Bob I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Bridging the Gap:**  $1,015,000 is a good compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $1,050,000 and Bob's offer of $980,000.
* **Final Push:** This might be my last attempt to get Bob to accept a price closer to my ideal. If he rejects, I'll likely sell to John for the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,015,000. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not close enough:**  While Bob's offer of $990,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, it's still not enough for me. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  I've already spent several rounds negotiating with Bob, and there's no guarantee he'll accept a higher counteroffer. 
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me a much higher profit, exceeding my minimum acceptable price. 

It's better to secure the higher price with John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob, who might not be willing to budge further."
