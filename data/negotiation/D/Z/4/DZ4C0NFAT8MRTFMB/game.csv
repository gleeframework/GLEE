"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While your offer is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm open to selling it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",980000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  I'm still a bit away from where I need to be to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference.  How about $1,015,000? It's a fair price that bridges the gap between our positions.  I'm hopeful we can finalize this deal.",1015000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,015,000. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",990000.0,Bob,6,
