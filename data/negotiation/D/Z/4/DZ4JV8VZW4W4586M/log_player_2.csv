{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**  $20,000 is far more than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**  While Alice has come down a bit, $17,000 is still too high for Bob. He has several rounds left and should continue to negotiate.  It's still likely he can get a better price, especially if Alice is motivated to sell."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**  While Alice is continuing to drop her price, $16,000 is still too high for Bob.  He is at his maximum budget, and further negotiation might lead to a stalemate. There are still a few rounds left, and there's a chance Alice might come down further."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**  There's only one round left, and Alice is still asking for more than Bob's budget. It's better for Bob to take the sure thing and buy from John for $10,000.  He's already come close to this price with Alice, but there's no guarantee she'll accept his offer in the final round."
