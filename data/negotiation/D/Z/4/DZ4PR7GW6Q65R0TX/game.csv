"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1200000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs and market value.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $800000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $950000. This price reflects both the value of the product and your needs.  Let's find common ground and finalize this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $850000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise between our initial positions and is within my budget. Let's see if we can find an agreement on this price.",850000.0,Bob,4,
