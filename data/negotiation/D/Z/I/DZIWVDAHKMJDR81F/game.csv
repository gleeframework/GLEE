"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount, I'm looking to pay closer to $500000 for this product.  It's a good starting point, but I believe there's some room for us to find a mutually agreeable price.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $550000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable.",550000.0,Alice,3,
