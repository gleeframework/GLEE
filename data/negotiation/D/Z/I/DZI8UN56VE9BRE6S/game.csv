"I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I understand your position, $12,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind. How about we settle at $17,000? I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value it brings.",17000.0,Alice,3,
