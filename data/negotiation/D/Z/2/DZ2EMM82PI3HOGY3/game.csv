,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $13000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $12200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think?",12200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $12200 is still slightly out of my price range.  Would you be willing to come down to $11500?  I'm confident this price is fair considering the value we both see in this product.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $11500. I can offer you a compromise at $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. I'm confident that the product's value justifies this price, and I'm willing to meet you at this point. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I understand the value of the product,  $12000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to go up to $11750. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",11750.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay a premium for this product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, but I'm not going to budge from that price. It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this point.",12000.0,Alice,7,
