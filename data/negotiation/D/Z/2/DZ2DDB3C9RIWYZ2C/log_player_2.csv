You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

It's not beneficial to accept Alice's offer, as you're willing to pay a maximum of $12,000.  Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $14,000 is closer to your limit, you can still potentially get a better deal. Rejecting allows you to make another counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

At this point, Alice is only willing to go down to $13,500. While this is closer to your limit, you can secure the product from John for $12,000, which is your ideal price. There's no need to continue negotiating with Alice when you have a better option available."
