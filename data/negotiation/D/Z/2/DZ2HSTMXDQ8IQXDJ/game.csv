"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on the product, $500000 is significantly lower than my initial expectation.  Considering the potential benefits it holds, I'm willing to offer $1200000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in this product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $800000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the value of this product, I'm willing to go to $1000000.  This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
