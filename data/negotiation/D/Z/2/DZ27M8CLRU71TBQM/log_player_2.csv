"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $115. It's a steal considering its value.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is close to your $100 limit, it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. You have room to counteroffer before reaching John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit too high for me right now.  Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer ($90), we aim to understand Alice's flexibility and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Positive:**  Maintaining a friendly and appreciative tone is important to keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Leaving Room:** Even if Alice rejects this offer, there's space to increase it before reaching your $100 limit or considering John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down to $105, which is within your $100 budget plus a little wiggle room.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and it's better to secure the product now than risk losing it by pushing for a smaller discount and potentially having to buy from John at full price."
