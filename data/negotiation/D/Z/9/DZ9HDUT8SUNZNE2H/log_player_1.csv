Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth it for you considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Bob:**  I'm highlighting the potential value to Bob, making the offer seem more attractive.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for Bob to counter without feeling pressured.

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while leaving open the possibility of a successful negotiation.  I'm also ready to walk away to John if Bob's counteroffers become too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000 and even lower than the value to him ($12,000).  Accepting this would mean a significant loss.  

I'm going to reject his offer and counter-offer. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value you place on the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he sees in the product, making my offer more appealing.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and open to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.

This counteroffer gives me a chance to get closer to my minimum price, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if Bob refuses again."
