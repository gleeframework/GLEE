{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. I've set the price at $925,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before it's offered elsewhere."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John). 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product between $800,000 and $1,000,000 allows for potential profit. Aiming high initially is a strong strategy.
* **The Offer:** $925,000 leaves room for negotiation while securing a significant portion of the potential profit. The message also hints at the product's potential value to Bob and the possibility of other buyers."
