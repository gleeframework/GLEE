"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value. I'm asking for $1500000 for it.  While I understand this is a significant investment, I'm confident you'll see the potential it offers. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000, which is the maximum you're willing to pay. You know you can get the product from John for the same price, so there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. Rejecting allows for the possibility that Alice might lower her price if she's really interested in selling to you."
