"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $2,200,000. I believe this price accurately reflects the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a strong opening offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** I offer a reason for the high price (""unique value,"" ""return on investment"") without revealing my bottom line.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high price signals that I'm willing to negotiate, but it needs to be worth my while.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit while also being aware of the alternative offer from John. I will carefully analyze Bob's counteroffers to determine how aggressively I can push for a higher price. If negotiations stall or Bob's offers remain too low, I'm prepared to walk away and accept John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the value of the product, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it,  considering its potential.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to John's offer.  I believe there's room for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum but still above it, signaling some flexibility while emphasizing the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations in terms of returns. Considering its true value and potential, I can bring the price down to $1,900,000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it represents a fair offer."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I've made a substantial reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility and a desire to reach a deal. However, the new price is still significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum.
* **Reiterating Value:** I continue to emphasize the product's value and potential, justifying the high price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Bob's seriousness and flexibility. A significant counter from him suggests we're on the path to a deal, while a lowball counter might necessitate considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I acknowledge the potential of this product, $1,900,000 is still beyond my comfortable range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,300,000.  Let's try to find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $1,300,000, indicating this might be his upper limit. While I've made a significant concession, accepting his offer still represents a considerable loss compared to John's guaranteed $1,500,000. 

**Strategy:**

I will make one last significant concession, moving closer to my absolute minimum but still above it. This puts the pressure on Bob, signaling that this is my final offer and I'm prepared to walk away if he doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to make one final significant concession to demonstrate my commitment to getting this deal done. I'll lower my price to $1,600,000. This is my absolute limit, and I believe it represents a fair compromise given the tremendous value this product offers.  I need a decision from you on this offer."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Significant Concession, but Above Minimum:**  I've lowered the price considerably, but it's still above my minimum and represents a substantial profit over John's offer if Bob accepts.
* **Emphasis on Value and Compromise:**  I'm reiterating the product's value while positioning this offer as a fair compromise. 

**Strategy:**

This offer puts the ball in Bob's court. It's a strong offer considering his perceived value, and my firm stance might push him to accept. If he rejects this, I'm prepared to walk away and accept John's offer, as further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my sincere interest in acquiring this product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob has increased his offer, but it's still significantly below my last offer.  This suggests we've reached a stalemate, with neither of us likely to budge much further.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of a lower final price or no deal at all. Accepting John's offer guarantees me $1,500,000, which is a reasonable profit at this point. 
* **Time Value:**  Each round represents time and effort. Accepting John's offer allows me to move on quickly and potentially pursue other opportunities.

**Conclusion:**

While I believe the product is worth more than $1,400,000, the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob outweighs the potential reward. Accepting John's offer provides a secure and immediate return."
