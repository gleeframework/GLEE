# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a high-quality item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $12,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $16,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $14,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's not worth haggling with Alice any further. She's unlikely to go below $15,500, and you can get the product for $15,000 from John."
