"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a high-quality item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $12,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think!",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $16,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $14,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think!",15500.0,Alice,5,
