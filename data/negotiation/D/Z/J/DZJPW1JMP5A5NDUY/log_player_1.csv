Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $925,000 on it. Could we perhaps negotiate a price closer to my valuation of $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
