"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for a price of $1,000,000. It's a significant value for you, considering its worth to you. Let's start our negotiation with this price.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $925,000? This is a fair compromise that still allows for a profitable deal for both of us. ",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $925,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $875,000?  That's a significant price increase from my initial offer.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $875,000 just doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer before considering other options.  I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is getting close, but it's still a bit rich for me. I'm willing to offer $885,000 as a final offer. This keeps us moving closer to a deal, but I need you to meet me halfway.",885000.0,Bob,6,
