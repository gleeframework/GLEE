"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750. This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to get a good deal. What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find common ground, but $9,250 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $8,900. This is a fair compromise, and I truly believe it's the best we can do to close this deal. What do you say?",8900.0,Bob,6,
