{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product worth much more than that. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that's slightly lower than my minimum value but still leaves room for potential counteroffers.  I'm aiming for a quick deal, but also want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $10,000. While I want to secure a sale, I'm not willing to compromise that much. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750. This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to get a good deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum value, it's still lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my minimum.  I want to see if I can get Bob to come up just a bit more, but I'm also mindful of the risk that he might walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,250? This is a very fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a good compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find common ground, but $9,250 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $8,900. This is a fair compromise, and I truly believe it's the best we can do to close this deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I want to make a sale,  I've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum value of $10,000. I've already made several concessions and it seems like we're at an impasse. To secure my desired outcome and avoid further negotiation, I will sell to John for $10,000."
