You should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to your target, you can likely still get it for less. Continue negotiating with Alice, aiming for a price closer to your $8,000 limit."

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, you're still above your ideal $8,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate, aiming for a final price closer to your limit.  You can likely get it for less if you keep pushing."
