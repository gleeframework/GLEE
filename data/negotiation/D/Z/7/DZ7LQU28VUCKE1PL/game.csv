"Bob, I appreciate your offer and see your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $950000?  This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950000. How about we meet at $920000?
