Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm starting with a price that is slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get as close to my desired $8,000 as possible while still giving Bob some incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum price of $8,000. I'm still hoping to get a better price and I have 9 rounds left to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $8,500. This is a compromise that is closer to my desired price of $8,000 while still leaving room for further negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer."
