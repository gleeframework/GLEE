"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,025,000?  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from owning it.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. How about we settle at $975,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it if we can agree on this price.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with that price.  Let's meet at $1,000,000. That's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
