"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,750. I can offer it to you for $10,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I'd like to throw in an additional incentive. I'll include a one-year warranty and premium support package, which is normally valued at $1,000. So, the total price would be $10,000 for the product, plus the warranty and support package. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,
