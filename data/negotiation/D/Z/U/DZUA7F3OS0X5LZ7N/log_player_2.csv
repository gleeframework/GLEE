Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal! I can do $7,800, but I was thinking maybe we could meet in the middle of our last two numbers, which would be $7,900. Would you be okay with that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,900
