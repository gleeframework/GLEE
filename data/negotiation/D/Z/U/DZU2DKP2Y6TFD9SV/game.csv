"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This would still give you a significant saving compared to your original valuation, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
