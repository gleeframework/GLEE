Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I believe this reflects its true worth."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start high to explore if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  
* **Room for negotiation:** The message leaves room for negotiation while emphasizing the product's value. 
* **Confident but not aggressive:**  The tone aims to be assertive about the product's worth without alienating Bob.

By starting high, you give yourself the best chance to maximize your profit with Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
