"Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

Since the product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $999,999, it's a good deal. I should accept the offer and save $1."
