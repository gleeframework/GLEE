"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $11,250. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  What do you say?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're making progress! However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can offer you the product for $11,000. Let me know if that's acceptable to you.",11000.0,Alice,5,
