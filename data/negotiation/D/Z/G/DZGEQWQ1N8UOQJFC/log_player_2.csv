"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to start with a price of $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's initial offer is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a lower price before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $10,500 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $11,250. Let me know if that's more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's new offer is slightly lower, it's still above Bob's target price of $10,500. Bob can continue to negotiate and try to get a better deal. There are still several rounds left, so he has time to see if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're making progress! However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can offer you the product for $11,000. Let me know if that's acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the best offer Bob has received so far.  While it's still more than Bob's ideal price, Alice has clearly shown a willingness to negotiate.  If Bob rejects this offer, he runs the risk of Alice getting less flexible, or even calling off the deal.  

Furthermore, he could end up buying from John at $12,000, which is worse than Alice's offer.  In this scenario, it's best for Bob to accept the offer and move forward with the purchase."
