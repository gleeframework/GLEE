"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better deal. It's better to reject the offer and see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further and offer the product for $1,300,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but $1,300,000 is still above your ideal price.  Since you have more rounds to negotiate, rejecting her offer gives you the opportunity to push for a lower price. You can likely secure a deal closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and your value for the product. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,250,000 still doesn't quite meet my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's finalize this now, before we run out of time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,275,000, which is within your budget and a good deal. You've already rejected two of her offers and made counteroffers. It's getting closer to the end of the rounds, and it's unlikely you'll be able to push for a lower price. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of having to buy it from John at a higher price."
