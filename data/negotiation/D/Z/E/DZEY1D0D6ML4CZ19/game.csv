"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further and offer the product for $1,300,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work together to find a solution.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and your value for the product. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,250,000 still doesn't quite meet my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's finalize this now, before we run out of time.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
