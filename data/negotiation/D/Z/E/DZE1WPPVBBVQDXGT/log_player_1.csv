I'm starting high, aiming for a profit. I'll see if Bob is willing to play ball. If he rejects, I'll have to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my desired $1,000,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle for a price that's so far from my initial goal. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $875,000.  This is a more significant compromise than my previous offers, but still above my minimum acceptable price. With only a few rounds left, I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept this offer."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting risky. Bob is clearly unwilling to go higher, and I'm running out of time.  To avoid potentially ending up with a lower price, I'm going to sell to John for $800,000. This guarantees me my minimum, and while it's not ideal, it's a safer move than risking a further drop in price."
