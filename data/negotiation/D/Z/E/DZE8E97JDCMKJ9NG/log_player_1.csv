"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good margin while still being potentially appealing to Bob. I want to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $10,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob in hopes of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, hopefully showing flexibility while still aiming for a better price than his initial counteroffer."

I'm still aiming for a higher price. While $10,500 is closer to my minimum, I think I can get more with further negotiation."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}

I'm going to counter with $11,250. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing that I'm getting closer to a compromise. I'm hoping this will be enough to get Bob to agree."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

The deal with Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, and we only have a few rounds left. At this point, it's unlikely we'll reach a much higher price, so I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $10,625."
