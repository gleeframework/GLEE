"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth $150 to me. I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. If not, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $160. It's still above my minimum, but shows I'm willing to compromise. If he rejects, I'm still willing to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting his offers, he might walk away.  I don't want to risk selling to John for $150 when I could potentially get more from Bob."
