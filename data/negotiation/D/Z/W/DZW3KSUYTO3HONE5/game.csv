"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me at that price?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $125. How about we meet in the middle at $135?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm not sure I can meet you at $135. How about $130? That's the lowest I can go.,130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still a bit higher on the price. How about we meet at $137.50? I think we can both be happy with that.",137.5,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher on the price. How about we meet at $132.50? That's the lowest I can go.",132.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $132.50. I think I can meet you halfway between $137.50 and $132.50, which would be $135. I'm willing to make a slight concession to get the deal done.",135.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. How about we meet at $132.50 again? I'm willing to make a deal at this price, but I'm not going any higher.",132.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already offered $135 and you've countered at $132.50 twice. I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $133.50. This is my final offer.",133.5,Alice,9,
