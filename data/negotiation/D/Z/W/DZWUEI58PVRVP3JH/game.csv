"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $10,250?",9250.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,250 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original asking price.  How about $10,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd need to get it down to $10,000. Can we do that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
