"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is far above his maximum budget of $10,000. There's no reason to accept this offer when he can get the product from John for less."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $12,000.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $15,500 is getting closer to his budget, it's still above his limit. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in this product, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about $13,000? I think this price is fair considering my budget and the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  To be honest, I have another buyer for $15,000.  I'd rather close this deal with you, so I'm willing to come down to $14,500.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's offer of $14,500 is still above Bob's budget. While Alice is trying to pressure Bob by mentioning a potential other buyer, Bob shouldn't be swayed. He can get the same product from John for $10,000, which is well within his budget.  It's time to move on and secure the best deal."
