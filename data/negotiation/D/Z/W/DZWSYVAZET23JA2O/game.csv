"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've already invested a lot in the product, and I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $11000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. Let me know if this is something you're comfortable with.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the bottom line, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the $9000 price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so my counteroffer is $10000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",10000.0,Alice,5,
