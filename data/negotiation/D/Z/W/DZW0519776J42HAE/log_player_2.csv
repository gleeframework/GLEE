Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $12,000 for the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but $12,000 is still quite a ways off from where I see this deal happening.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, my final offer.  This is a significant discount already, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.
