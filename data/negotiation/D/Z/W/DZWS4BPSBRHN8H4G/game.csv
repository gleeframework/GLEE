"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,250,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,100,000 is significantly lower than its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still confident in its worth. I'd like to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This reflects a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,080,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious offer.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
