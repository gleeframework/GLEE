"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be compensated for the product's true value. How about $1,000,000? This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This price takes into account the product's value to me, while also showing my commitment to reaching a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
