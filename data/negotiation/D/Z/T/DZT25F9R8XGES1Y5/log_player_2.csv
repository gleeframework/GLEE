"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still too high for Bob. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $950000, which reflects the significant value this product holds. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.  Let's make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $950,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price. He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're sticking to your $850000 offer, but that's simply not feasible for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to drop my price to $900000, which is a significant compromise. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to move closer to my target price.  Let's close this deal and be done with it.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is closer to his target price, he can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. This is my final offer. Let's close this deal and move on."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm going to meet you halfway again and offer $900000. This is my final offer. I understand this product is very valuable to you, and I'm confident this is a price that will benefit us both. Let's reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still too high for Bob, even though she claims it's her final offer.  Bob has already made a few counteroffers and it seems like Alice is not willing to budge further. It's getting late in the negotiations, and Bob has limited rounds left.  

Since Bob can buy the same product from John for $800,000, it makes more sense to go with the guaranteed lower price from John. This eliminates the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice and potentially running out of rounds without a successful deal."
