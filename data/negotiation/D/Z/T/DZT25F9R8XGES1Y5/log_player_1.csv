"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $1,000,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, leaving space for potential negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  $850,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **I have time to negotiate.** I'm not desperate for a quick sale and have 9 more rounds to work with Bob.
* **John is a safety net.**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,200,000 gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which reflects the significant value this product holds. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer to show Bob I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not willing to accept his initial price.
* **Compromise:** $950,000 is a compromise from my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to maintain my position and encourage Bob to see the potential.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the communication friendly and focused on reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is stuck on his price.**  He's not budging from his initial offer, even though it's significantly lower than my minimum.
* **I have the upper hand.**  I know I can sell to John for a higher price, so I'm not desperate to close with Bob.
* **More room to negotiate.**  I'm willing to explore other offers, and there's still time to reach a better agreement with Bob or walk away and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your $850,000 offer, but that's simply not feasible for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to drop my price to $900,000, which is a significant compromise. It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to move closer to my target price.  Let's close this deal and be done with it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price in the middle of my last offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the deal:** I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" aspect for Bob to make the offer more appealing.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by saying ""let's close this deal and be done with it"" to potentially push Bob towards an agreement.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm still not willing to accept his offer, reminding him I have other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $900000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. This is my final offer. Let's close this deal and move on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While he's moved slightly closer, $875,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **I'm not under pressure.**  I have the option of selling to John, giving me the leverage to hold out for a better price. 
* **Room for improvement.**  There are still a few rounds left, and I believe I can push Bob a little higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm going to meet you halfway again and offer $900,000. This is my final offer. I understand this product is very valuable to you, and I'm confident this is a price that will benefit us both. Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  By offering $900,000, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to meet him halfway again. 
* **Finality:** I'm stating that this is my final offer to increase the pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Value emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds to him, hoping it will encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and focused on reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. 

This is a calculated risk.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
