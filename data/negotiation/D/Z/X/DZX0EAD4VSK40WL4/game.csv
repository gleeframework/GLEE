"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its unique features, I'm initially offering it for $22,000.  What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be useful, but  $8,000 is closer to my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its market value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could you consider something closer to $19,000?",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this product has value, but $19,000 is still much higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  Would you consider $10,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counter offer. I can see you're serious about this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? That's a fair compromise, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $15,000 is still pushing my budget.  I could go up to $11,000, but that's my absolute limit.",11000.0,Bob,6,
