Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique benefits, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a price slightly below your guaranteed offer ($1,450,000) leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a higher profit. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and fairness of the price, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or expresses concerns about the price."
