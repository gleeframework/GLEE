"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's something I value at least $80, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for $100, which is less than your maximum budget of $120. While you could try to negotiate a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice would go lower. Accepting this offer gets you the product for a price you're comfortable with."
