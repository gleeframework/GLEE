Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This represents a significant gain for you compared to its potential worth to your business.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 925000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit, but stay below Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A high initial offer allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price still well above your minimum. 
* **Time Value:** While John offers a guaranteed $800,000, a quick sale to Bob at a higher price is preferable.

This offer balances ambition with a degree of realism to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
