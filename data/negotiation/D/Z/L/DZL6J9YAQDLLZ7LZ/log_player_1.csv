Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it presents significant value, even exceeding the price point.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to get slightly more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below my guaranteed sale price creates a sense of urgency and perceived value for Bob. It might be tempting enough for him to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, Bob could counter-offer if he's truly interested, giving me a chance to potentially secure a slightly higher price. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes a quick sale is desirable. If time wasn't a factor, I might consider a slightly lower initial offer to increase the odds of Bob accepting and avoid potential delays with other buyers."
