Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of Alice's strategy and her offer to Bob:

**Understanding the Scenario**

* **Alice's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice (this is her ""walk-away"" price).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **John's Value:** John acts as a safety net, guaranteeing Alice $1,500,000 if Bob declines.

**Alice's Strategy**

Alice's optimal strategy is to offer the product to Bob at a price slightly below his maximum valuation. This maximizes the chance of Bob accepting while still securing a profit for Alice.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $995,000. I believe it offers excellent value and would be a valuable addition to your portfolio. Please let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 995000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Pricing:**  By offering the product at $995,000, Alice positions it just below Bob's $1,000,000 valuation, making it highly attractive. 
* **Messaging:** The message is polite, professional, and subtly hints at the value proposition for Bob.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a slightly higher final price. 
* **Risk Tolerance:** Alice could potentially offer the product at an even higher price (closer to $1,000,000), but this increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
