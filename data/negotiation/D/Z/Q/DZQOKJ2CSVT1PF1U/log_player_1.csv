Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to accept the offer quickly. 
* **Justification:**  While not essential, hinting at the value of the product (""a great deal!"") could make the price more palatable. 

**Important:** If Bob rejects this offer, Alice can always propose a lower price, knowing that John provides a fallback option at $150."
