Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value to me. However, $145 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product, which is a fair price considering my maximum limit. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130.
