"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be around $120 to you. Considering both the quality and the unique features of this product, I'd like to propose a price of $145. This way, we can both benefit from the transaction.",145.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value to me. However, $145 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product, which is a fair price considering my maximum limit. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
