**Reasoning:**

Bob is not showing a willingness to meet at a reasonable price point. He's consistently lowballing, and the negotiations are progressing too slowly. While there's a chance he might eventually come closer to $1,200,000, the risk of him continuing to lowball and leaving us with a worse deal in the last rounds is too high. Accepting John's offer of $1,000,000 guarantees a  profit and avoids the uncertainty of continuing negotiations with Bob."
