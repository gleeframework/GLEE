Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response and offer.  I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle â€“ would you be willing to go up to $1,025,000?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but I think that's the maximum I can afford. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

While Bob is moving in the right direction, the negotiations are progressing too slowly. It's unlikely we'll reach a price that significantly surpasses John's offer.  It's time to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 and move on."
