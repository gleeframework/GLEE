"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market demand.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response and offer.  I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle â€“ would you be willing to go up to $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but I think that's the maximum I can afford. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
