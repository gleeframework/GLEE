"I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $16000. This is a compromise that should be beneficial to both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,

This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",16500.0,Alice,5,
