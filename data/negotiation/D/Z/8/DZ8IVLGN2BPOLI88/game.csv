"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is my final offer, as I can buy the product from John for that price. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $950,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  I'm serious about getting this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider this.",900000.0,Bob,4,
