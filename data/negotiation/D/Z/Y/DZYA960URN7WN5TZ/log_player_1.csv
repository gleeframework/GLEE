"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a great deal considering the value of this product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a strong starting point.
* **Enthusiastic Tone:** A positive and encouraging message helps to build rapport and create a more favorable negotiation environment.
* **Focus on Value:** Emphasizing the product's value can help Bob see the potential benefit of accepting my offer. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  The price is below my minimum, leaving room to potentially negotiate further if Bob counters. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** I'm not pushing for an immediate decision. This allows Bob time to consider the offer and potentially counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to my maximum budget. How about $1,250,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Low:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** I still have 8 rounds left. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  Accepting Bob's offer now would result in a substantial loss for me. By rejecting, I maintain leverage and show I am serious about getting a fair price. 
* **Sell to John as a Backup:**  While I'm open to negotiation,  I have the option to sell to John for my minimum price if negotiations with Bob fail. This provides a safety net."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal work!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Firm but Fair Price:**  I'm offering a counter that's still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while remaining firm on my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the product's true value to justify my price point. 
* **Focus on Compromise:** I emphasize ""meeting in the middle"" to create a sense of mutual benefit and encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and encouraging tone to foster a collaborative negotiation atmosphere."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's keep pushing towards a deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's only $75,000 lower than my previous offer, signaling a genuine effort to meet Bob halfway.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize that this price allows ""both of us to walk away happy,"" reinforcing the idea of a win-win situation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While I'm making a small concession, I'm not giving in entirely. This keeps the pressure on Bob to consider my offer seriously.
* **Enthusiasm and Openness:** I maintain a positive tone,  encouraging Bob to engage and find common ground.
* **Time is on My Side:** With 5 rounds left, I'm still in a good position to negotiate effectively."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  While I value the product, I'm still not comfortable going above $1,325,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point.

* **Negotiation is Still Possible:**  With 4 rounds left, there's still room for further negotiations.  
* **Maintain Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not desperate and willing to walk away if a fair price isn't achieved. 
* **Strong Position:** I'm in a good position because I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, which is a better outcome for me than accepting Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:** I'll aim to counter with a price slightly lower than my last offer, showing willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable outcome."
