Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I can meet you at $82.50, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $82.50. You've reached a point where the potential savings from haggling further with Alice are minimal compared to the guaranteed price of $80 from John.  It makes more sense to cut your losses and buy from John."
