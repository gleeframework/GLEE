"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it's a perfect fit for you. My asking price is $14,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  My message briefly alludes to the product's suitability for Bob, implying its worth. 

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  A higher starting price gives me more leverage to negotiate downwards.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will reveal how determined he is to buy the product. 
* **Maintain Options:**  I can always fall back on selling to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I want to make a profit, I'm not desperate to sell.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Maintain Leverage:**  By rejecting, I demonstrate that I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product. 
* **Explore Counteroffers:**  This opens the opportunity to make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me.
* **Keep John as an Option:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is lower than I expected, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This price reflects the value you'll receive, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let's see if we can make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Compromise:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum.
* **Value-Based Justification:** I'm framing the price as a reflection of the value Bob will get, appealing to his logic and potentially making him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Positive and Optimistic Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and optimistic tone to encourage Bob to continue negotiating.

This approach aims to:

* **Get Closer to My Target:**  A price of $12,500 is closer to my desired outcome than Bob's offer.
* **Test Bob's Willingness to Compromise:**  His response will show whether he's willing to negotiate further.
* **Keep Options Open:**  If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I can still choose to sell to John or make another counteroffer in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $11,250 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer demonstrates that I'm firm in my commitment to getting a fair price.
* **Exploring Further Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially given that Bob has shown willingness to compromise.
* **John Remains an Option:**  The possibility of selling to John for $12,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail.

I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round. By continuing to negotiate, I aim to maximize my potential profit without jeopardizing my minimum price requirement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11,750, which is a fair price considering the value you'll receive from the product. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm only decreasing my offer by $500 this time, showing I'm serious about getting a price closer to my minimum.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Positive and Confident Tone:** My message remains friendly and optimistic, fostering a positive negotiation atmosphere.

This approach aims to:

* **Close the Gap:** This counteroffer brings me closer to Bob's offer, but still maintains a comfortable margin above my minimum.
* **Test Bob's Flexibility:** This final price point will reveal whether he's willing to meet me halfway.
* **Keep John in the Picture:**  If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close. I'd be willing to do $11,000 to get this deal done today. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is only $1,000 away from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation dragging out without a favorable outcome is high.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** Selling to John guarantees a price of $12,000, which is my minimum and a decent profit.

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $12,000 with Bob, the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price. Selling to John provides a guaranteed profit and minimizes the risk of not closing the deal within the 10 rounds."
