Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,125,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

At this point, Bob is unlikely to go any higher. Accepting his offer of $1,050,000 is a significant profit and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer further or the negotiation failing altogether."
