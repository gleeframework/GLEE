While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, it doesn't quite reflect the full potential value this product offers. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm getting fair value.  How about $1,300,000?  This price reflects the unique benefits and potential ROI, while still remaining competitive.  Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
