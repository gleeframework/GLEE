"Alice, your initial price is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $800,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible.  To move this forward, I propose a revised price of $2,000,000. This reflects the true value of the product and its potential benefits.  What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $2,000,000 is still beyond my current budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the potential benefits of the product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your willingness to move closer to a middle ground.  While $1,000,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm motivated to make a deal. Let's try $1,750,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, while still recognizing the inherent value of this product. What are your thoughts?",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,750,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to reach a price that allows for a more comfortable margin.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This would be a substantial investment for me, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
