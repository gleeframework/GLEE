"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I consider its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the product's worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring a fair deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which I believe is a fair price for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but we're still quite a ways apart in terms of price.  I need to see some more movement on your end to make this deal viable.  How about $985,000? This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's quality and potential.",985000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and $985,000 is a good step in the right direction. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay that much. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $985,000 and $950,000, which would be $967,500. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",967500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're driving a hard bargain! I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I can come down slightly to $975,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair compromise for both of us. ",975000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $970,000, but I don't think I can go any higher. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and finalize the deal.",970000.0,Bob,8,
