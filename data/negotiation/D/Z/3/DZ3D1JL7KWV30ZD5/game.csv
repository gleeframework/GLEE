"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, and I believe it's worth the same to you. I'm offering it to you for $16,000. Let me know what you think!",16000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $16,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $14,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",14500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value. Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $15,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value. Let me know what you think.",15250.0,Bob,4,
