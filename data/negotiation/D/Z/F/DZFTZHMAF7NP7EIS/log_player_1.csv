Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,000,000 is higher than $800,000, but it gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $1,000,000 is still above your minimum of $1,200,000, which means you're not giving away the farm.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows for some back-and-forth and potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and either accept it if it's close to my target or make a new counteroffer. I'll also keep in mind the option of selling to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm going to reject it.  Here's why:

* **My Minimum:** I'm aiming for at least $1,200,000. Accepting $850,000 would be a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  Bob's offer shows he's willing to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially get closer to my target price.
* **John's Offer:** I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and create an opportunity to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise considering both our perspectives. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

This counteroffer balances several factors:

* **Moving Closer:**  It's a step towards Bob's offer, showing flexibility. 
* **Holding Ground:** It's still above Bob's initial offer, indicating I'm not desperate for a sale.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** It leaves space for further negotiation, potentially ending in a deal closer to my target.

I'm confident this counteroffer will keep the negotiations moving while still staying within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product.  This represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value you place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. Here's my reasoning:

* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,200,000.  This sets a strong benchmark for my negotiations with Bob.
* **Room for Compromise:**  Bob's offer shows he's willing to move closer, and I believe there's still potential for him to increase his bid.
* **Strategic Advantage:** By rejecting, I maintain control and can potentially push Bob to a more favorable price point.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap while keeping John's offer in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 925000} 
```

This counteroffer is strategic:

* **Closing the Gap:** It significantly reduces the gap between our positions, showing a genuine desire to reach an agreement.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** It's still slightly above Bob's offer, reminding him that I'm not desperate for a quick sale. 
* **Testing the Waters:** It allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to meet my terms while still having the option to sell to John if necessary. 

I'm confident this counteroffer will bring us closer to a deal, and I'm eager to see Bob's response."
