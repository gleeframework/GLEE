Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product might be high, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $160 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. $165 is a good price, and it's getting close to my initial asking price. I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $120."
