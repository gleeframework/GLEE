{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's a great fit for you. I'm asking for $14,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,500 is more than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's below Bob's maximum of $15,000, giving you both some wiggle room to negotiate.
* **It shows confidence:**  A strong opening offer signals you believe in the product's value.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below your desired price point. There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially earn more by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,750? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $13,200? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my desired price point, and rejecting it could risk losing the sale to him entirely or needing to lower my offer further. Accepting his offer secures a good profit and avoids further negotiation."
