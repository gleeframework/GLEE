"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,850,000 is still above my maximum, but I'm willing to go to $1,200,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my genuine desire to acquire this product.  I believe this price is fair, considering the value we both recognize in the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems we're getting closer. While $1,200,000 is still below what I hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle at $1,500,000 even. This is my final offer, as I do have another interested buyer.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
