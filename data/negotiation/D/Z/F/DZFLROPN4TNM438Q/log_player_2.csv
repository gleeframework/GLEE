Alice's offer:

Alice's offer is still too high, but she's showing a willingness to negotiate. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're getting closer. While $1,200,000 is still below what I hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle at $1,500,000 even. This is my final offer, as I do have another interested buyer.

Alice's offer is still too high for me, and I'm not sure if further negotiation will get us to a price I'm comfortable with. To avoid further haggling and ensure I get the product within my budget, I'll go with John's offer."
