Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing your minimum acceptable price is $120.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** Starting at $119 leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. It's unlikely he'll counter with more than $120, which is your guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Appeal to Value:**  The message frames the price as a ""special deal"" to make it more enticing. 
 
**Important Note:** This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above his perceived value. If you had more information about Bob's tendencies, you could potentially adjust your strategy."
