"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product that is incredibly valuable to you.  I'm confident that this product will be a significant asset for you, and I'm willing to sell it at a price that is fair for both of us.  I'm asking for $12,000.  This is a fantastic deal considering the product's worth to you, and it's significantly more than I would receive from another buyer.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
