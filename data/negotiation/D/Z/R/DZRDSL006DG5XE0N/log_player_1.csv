Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **My Minimum:** My minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000 (because I have a guaranteed buyer in John).
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a $500,000 difference between Bob's value and my minimum. 
* **Offer:** By offering $1,400,000, I'm leaving $100,000 for Bob to gain, which is a strong incentive for him to accept.  

This offer balances the potential for a higher profit with the risk of Bob rejecting it."
