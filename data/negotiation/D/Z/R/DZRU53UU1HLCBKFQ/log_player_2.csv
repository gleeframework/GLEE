Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I think you'll find it's a great deal.

While $1,025,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, you can still do better.  Rejecting this offer gives you more leverage to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000. However, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can sell it to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still higher than what John is offering.  Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, buying from John for $1,000,000 is the best option."
