Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $100.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob is willing to pay $120, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It leaves room for compromise:** You can adjust the price if Bob counteroffers.

Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is close to my desired price and higher than what John would pay. It's a good deal for me, so I will accept it."
