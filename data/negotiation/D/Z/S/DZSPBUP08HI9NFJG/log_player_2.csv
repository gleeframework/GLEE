"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm sure you'll agree that this is a fair price considering the benefits you'll get from owning this product. What do you say, Bob? Will you take it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  Even though Alice is trying to sell you the product for more than its value to her, the price is still lower than what John is asking. 
* **You save money by accepting Alice's offer.** You'll pay $1,200,000 instead of $1,500,000."
