"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",7000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $7,200? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",7200.0,Alice,5,
