"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9000? I think that's a more reasonable price for a unique item like this.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11000. It's still a great deal, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you be willing to sell the product for $10500? I think that's a fair price for a unique item like this, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done.",10500.0,Bob,4,
