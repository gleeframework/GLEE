"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, but my budget is limited. Could we perhaps agree on a price closer to $8000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8000 is a bit tight for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a great deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I appreciate your flexibility, I am still unable to meet you at $11000 given my current budget constraints. Would it be possible to consider $9000 as a compromise?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a great value for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. I've reviewed my budget once again, and I believe I can offer $9500 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us.",9500.0,Bob,6,
