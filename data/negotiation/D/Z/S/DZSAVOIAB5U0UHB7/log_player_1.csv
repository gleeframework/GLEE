Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire [Product Name] for a price of $1,700,000. This is a significant investment, but I believe it will be a valuable asset for you.  I understand this is a large sum, so I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,700,000. This is above Bob's valuation of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and gives me a potential profit margin. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and persuasive, emphasizing the value of the product for Bob while acknowledging the large price tag. It also leaves the door open for negotiation, which is important.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize potential profit:**  This strategy aims to get as close to my minimum value of $1,500,000 as possible while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Negotiation:** By offering a price above Bob's valuation but still lower than my fallback price, I create an opportunity for negotiation where we can both potentially benefit. 
* **Building a relationship:** Being open to negotiation demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to work with Bob, which can be beneficial for future interactions.

**Important Note:**  It's important to remember that the success of this strategy depends on Bob's willingness to negotiate. If he's firmly set on his $800,000 valuation, it might be necessary to adjust the offer. However, this strategy provides a solid starting point for maximizing your potential profit."
