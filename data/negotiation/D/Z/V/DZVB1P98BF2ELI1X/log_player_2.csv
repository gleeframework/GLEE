"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product at a price that I think is very competitive. Given the value it holds for you, I believe $900,000 is a fair price for this exceptional item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is less than your $1,000,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice values the product significantly less than your offer, so there's a good chance you can get a better price."
