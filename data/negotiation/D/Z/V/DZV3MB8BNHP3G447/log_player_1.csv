"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $8,500 is still too low for me. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000. This is my final offer, as I have another seller willing to sell for $8,000. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $9,000 is better than his previous offer and closer to my minimum than John's offer. It's also a decent price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
