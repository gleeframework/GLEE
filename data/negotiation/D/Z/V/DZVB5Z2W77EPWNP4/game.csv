"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $7,750 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,250. This price is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and still allows for a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,
