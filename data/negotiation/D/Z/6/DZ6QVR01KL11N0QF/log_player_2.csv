# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm proposing a new price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my original offer. However, I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. Considering your latest offer, I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price.

While Alice is coming down, she's unlikely to go below $1,000,000.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the product at the guaranteed price from John."
