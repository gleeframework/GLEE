"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm proposing a new price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is closer, but still a little steep for me.  Would you consider $975,000?  That's a significant move on my part, showing I'm serious about buying.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my original offer. However, I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. Considering your latest offer, I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
