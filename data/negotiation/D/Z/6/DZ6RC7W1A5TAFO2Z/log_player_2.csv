"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer, aiming to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This aggressive counteroffer will likely be rejected, but it sets the stage for future negotiation rounds and demonstrates my commitment to finding a deal within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still slightly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to reject the offer and try to negotiate further. There are still rounds remaining and I can potentially secure a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,300,000. This is still below my budget, and a significant reduction from Alice's offer. I hope this shows I'm serious about buying but also willing to negotiate fairly. This should be a reasonable offer for Alice, but it still leaves room for some potential concessions if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now exactly my maximum budget.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that we won't reach an agreement before I have to buy from John.  There's also a chance that Alice's offer could increase in subsequent rounds. It's best to accept this offer and secure the product within my budget."
