"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my research and the market value of similar products, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and provides a good starting point for our negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 significantly undervalues the unique aspects and potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This price reflects a more accurate representation of its value.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1,900,000 is still outside my range. To show my continued interest, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Your offer demonstrates a clear understanding of the value this product offers. To meet you closer to your price point, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair and realistic price, considering the product's unique capabilities.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,600,000 is still above my budget.  To find a final compromise, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This is a significant investment for me, and represents the absolute maximum I can afford. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
