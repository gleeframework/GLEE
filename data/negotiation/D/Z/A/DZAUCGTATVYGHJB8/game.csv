"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000,  which is still a good deal for you, considering its value to you.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,750. Can you consider that?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,900,  which is a fair compromise given the product's value to you. Let's try to close this deal.",10900.0,Alice,5,
