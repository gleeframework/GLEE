Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000.  I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to continue exploring a deal with Bob, hoping to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000,  which is still a good deal for you, considering its value to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below it. I believe there is still potential to negotiate a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,900,  which is a fair compromise given the product's value to you. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10900}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to go to $10,600. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  We are now in round 6, with only 4 rounds left.  I have to consider the time constraint and the likelihood that Bob will come up to my price point.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price from Bob, the guaranteed $10,000 from John is a safe and reliable option.  I'm choosing to sell to John to avoid the risk of losing the deal and getting less than my minimum."
