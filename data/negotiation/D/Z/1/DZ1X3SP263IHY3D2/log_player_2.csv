"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item that you value at $100, while also allowing me to maximize my earnings. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can do better.  You value the product at $100, and you have a guaranteed option to buy it from John for that price.  There's no reason to accept a price higher than your maximum value."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $105 for the product. This allows you to still make a decent profit, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 105}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. In order to reach an agreement that benefits both parties, I would like to propose a price of $110 for the product. This still allows me to make a good profit, while remaining within your budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but $110 is still more than you're willing to pay. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $100, so there's no reason to settle for a higher price. You can try to negotiate further with Alice, hoping to get closer to your target price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $108, which is a fair compromise and allows both of us to make a reasonable deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 108}
