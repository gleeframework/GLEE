"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item that you value at $100, while also allowing me to maximize my earnings. Let me know if this works for you!",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $105 for the product. This allows you to still make a decent profit, and it's within my budget.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. In order to reach an agreement that benefits both parties, I would like to propose a price of $110 for the product. This still allows me to make a good profit, while remaining within your budget.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $108, which is a fair compromise and allows both of us to make a reasonable deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",108.0,Bob,4,
