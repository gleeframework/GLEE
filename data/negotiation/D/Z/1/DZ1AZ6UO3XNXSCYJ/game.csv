"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",90.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down on the price Alice, I appreciate that. How about $70? That's a reasonable offer for both of us, I think.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you like the compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll sell the product to you for $85. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal!",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting close! I can do $75, and I think that's a really fair price. It's more than halfway from our last offers, and it would help me out a lot.",75.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway again! I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82.50. It's a small step back from our last offer, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",82.5,Alice,7,
