Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal for you, and it's fair for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $85 for the product, as I think it's a bit overpriced at $95. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $85 is better than selling to John, I think I can get a better price by negotiating further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $90. This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $100 to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price at $90. I'm willing to pay $82 for the product, as I think that's a fair price considering it's worth $80 to you. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, Bob's offer of $82 is better than selling to John for $80. It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiation."
