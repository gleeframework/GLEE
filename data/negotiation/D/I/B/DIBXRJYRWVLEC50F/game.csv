"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product at a competitive price of $9,500.  This is a great deal for you, given its value to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  This price reflects both of our needs and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new offer of $8,800. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $8,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we settle on $9,200? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",9200.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're still not willing to budge much, Alice. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $9,100. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9100.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $9,100, but I'm still hoping for a slightly better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. How about $9,150? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. It's getting very late in the negotiation, and I don't want to lose this deal, but I also need to make sure I get a fair price. Let me know if you can accept this offer.",9150.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're still not willing to budge much, Alice. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $9,100. I've already gone as low as I can, and I need to make sure I stay within my budget. Can you reconsider your offer?",9100.0,Bob,8,
