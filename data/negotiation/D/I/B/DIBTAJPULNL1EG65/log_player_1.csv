Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible while still exceeding her minimum selling price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still aiming high. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, guaranteeing her $12,000. This knowledge empowers her to aim higher with Bob. 

By offering the product at $11,500, Alice attempts to strike a balance between maximizing her potential profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
