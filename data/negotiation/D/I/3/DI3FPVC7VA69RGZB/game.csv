"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $135. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $135 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $115. This is my final offer, as I can get the product elsewhere for $80. ",115.0,Bob,4,,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $115, Bob. I'm willing to compromise at $128. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",128.0,Alice,5,,
