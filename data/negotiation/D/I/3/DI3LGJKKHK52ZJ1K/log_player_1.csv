Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and the high demand I'm experiencing, I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its potential benefits for you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's reservation price is not helpful:**  We know Bob values the product at $8,000, but we cannot directly use this information. If we offer a price below $15,000, we lose potential profit from selling to John.
* **Aim high, but be realistic:** Starting with a price higher than John's offer ($15,000) makes sense. Offering $20,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.  
* **Justification:** Highlighting ""exclusive opportunity,"" ""unique value,"" and ""high demand"" creates perceived value and justifies the high price. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. We can always negotiate down if Bob rejects it, potentially settling at a price closer to $15,000.  The goal is to maximize profit, and starting high gives us more room to maneuver."
