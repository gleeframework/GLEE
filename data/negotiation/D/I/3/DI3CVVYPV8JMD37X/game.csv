"I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $140, and that's as low as I can go. The product is worth a lot more to me than that, but I'm willing to make a compromise.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $140. I can see you're willing to pay $130, so I'll meet you in the middle at $135. That's the lowest I can go.",135.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another slight adjustment, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm getting close to my limit, and I'm starting to think that I should just go to John's offer. However, I'll make one last attempt to negotiate. I can do $136, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John.",136.0,Bob,10,
