"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your perspective, but $600,000 undervalues the product significantly.  To move this forward, I could consider $950,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's on offer.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While I see the value in the product, $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $750,000 is getting closer, but to make this work for me, I'd need to see $850,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial ask and feels like a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
