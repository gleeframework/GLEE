Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your perspective, but $600,000 undervalues the product significantly.  To move this forward, I could consider $950,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's on offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $750,000 is getting closer, but to make this work for me, I'd need to see $850,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial ask and feels like a fair deal for both of us.
