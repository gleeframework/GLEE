Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Let me know if this is something you can consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob. Even though $8,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However,  $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $8,500 is my final offer. If you're serious about getting this product, let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $8,200. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can move forward with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $8,200 is still a good deal and it's getting close to my minimum. There's always a chance he'll reject my next counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely."
