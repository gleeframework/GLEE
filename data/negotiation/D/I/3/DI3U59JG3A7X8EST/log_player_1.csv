Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts high, reflecting the product's value to me. It also opens the door for negotiation, inviting Bob to counteroffer. This allows me to see his willingness to pay and potentially come to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $75 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? This gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $87.50 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $82.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $82.50 is above my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to sell the product and avoid the risk of further negotiation, which might lead to a lower price or a failed sale."
