"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you coming down to $900,000.  However, I'm looking to stay closer to the $800,000 range.  I'm confident that this product is worth that much to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Would you be willing to consider that?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and I believe it's a compromise that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
