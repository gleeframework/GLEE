{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, and I'm open to negotiation.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $1,200,000, but I'm also willing to work with Bob to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. If he rejects my offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and potentially adjust my own. However, I'm always keeping John in mind as a backup option, as he's willing to pay my full asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for such a drastic discount. I'll counter with a price closer to my target and see if we can reach a compromise. I'm also keeping John in mind, as he's my fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, $950,000 is still significantly less than what I need to earn. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's too far below my target. I'll counter with a higher offer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement. If we can't, John is still a reliable backup option."
