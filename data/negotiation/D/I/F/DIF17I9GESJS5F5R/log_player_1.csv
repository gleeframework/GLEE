"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic [product description] that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $150, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me more leverage. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to establish rapport with Bob and encourage him to engage. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I briefly highlight the product's potential benefits to Bob, hinting at its value without revealing too much. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I explicitly mention my willingness to negotiate, showing flexibility and making Bob feel comfortable with counter-offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100, but I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I have 9 rounds left and want to see if I can push for a better deal.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a great product, and I think you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $150 to $135, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that's reasonable for me. 
* **Positive Reinforcement:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and reiterate the product's value to encourage him to accept.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize that a price of $135 is a good deal for both of us, creating a win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $125 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not ready to accept it. I want to see if I can push for a bit more, as I have 6 rounds left to negotiate.  I will counter with a price closer to my previous offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise Again:**  I'm now proposing $130, right in the middle of our last two offers. This shows flexibility and a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Positive Framing:**  I emphasize the ""good deal"" aspect for Bob and express confidence in the product, hoping to entice him into accepting.
* **Limited Time:** I'm not explicitly mentioning the remaining rounds, but it's implied that time is running out, which might subtly push Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $128, that's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $128 is very close to my desired price range, and we're already halfway through the negotiation process.  With only 4 rounds left, it's getting riskier to keep rejecting offers. Accepting his offer ensures a decent profit and avoids the risk of having to sell to John for $100."
