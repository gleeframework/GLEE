# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity. I have a unique product that I believe would greatly benefit you, and I think it's worth every penny of its $12,000 value to you. However, I understand that sometimes finding the right price can be a challenge. Therefore, I am offering you the chance to acquire this product at a special introductory price of $14,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its immense value to you. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.
