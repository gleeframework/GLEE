``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $1,600,000. While this is less than my ideal price, it's still a significant profit margin above my minimum ($1,200,000). Continuing to push Bob risks him walking away, especially since he hasn't budged from this number. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting less later or losing him as a buyer entirely."
