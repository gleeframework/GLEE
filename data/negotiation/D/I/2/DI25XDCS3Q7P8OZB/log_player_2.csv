"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $8,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore his options and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  Offering $7,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay. This counteroffer sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $7,500, which is a good price for Bob. He's already saved $500 from the initial offer, and continuing to negotiate risks the chance of Alice walking away or him having to buy from John at a higher price.  It's a good time to accept and close the deal."
