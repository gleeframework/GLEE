"I'm very interested in the product, but $2,300,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I think it's a fair price considering the market value and my financial constraints.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize your budget constraints, the product's value significantly exceeds that amount. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to a deal, but $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned earlier.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
