Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counters, but also establishes a starting point that emphasizes the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try and secure a price closer to what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $850,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a good price considering the product's value to Bob. It also keeps some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below what the product is worth to me. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 820000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $820,000.  This is a further compromise, but still reflects the value of the product.  I'm hoping this offer is enticing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also willing to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, but I'm not willing to risk another round of negotiation. It's time to sell to John and ensure I get a guaranteed $800,000."
