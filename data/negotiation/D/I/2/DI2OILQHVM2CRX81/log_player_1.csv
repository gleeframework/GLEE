Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll really value. I'm willing to sell it for $140.  I believe it's worth much more, and I know it's worth even more to you, but I want to offer you a fair price."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($150) while staying above your minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justify the Price:**  Highlighting the product's value to Bob and mentioning fairness can make the price more palatable.

This strategy balances your desire for a high price with the need to make the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
