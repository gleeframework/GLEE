{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is strategic. It:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  $1,100,000 is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. 
* **Shows willingness to compromise:**  I'm not starting at my absolute maximum, signaling a desire for a deal.
* **Highlights potential benefit:**  I frame it as a good deal for *both* of us. 
* **Opens the door for a counteroffer:**  This encourages Bob to participate in negotiation.

If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and either accept, counter again, or move on to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While $950,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still too low for me to accept.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I need to find a balance between getting a good price and potentially losing the deal to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering $1,050,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reiterate Value:** I remind Bob of the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Call for Agreement:** I emphasize finding a ""middle ground"" to encourage a deal.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain a High Price:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Encourage Further Negotiation:** This keeps the door open for further bargaining.
* **Show Flexibility:**  I've demonstrated a willingness to adjust my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we compromise at $1,025,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,025,000 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's also a strong indication that Bob is serious about buying the product and that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk of losing a deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance that Bob will walk away, and I might end up having to sell to John for a lower price than I initially hoped for.
* **Time and Effort:** Further negotiation could drag out the process and potentially waste time. 
* **Potential future gains:**  Even though I'm not getting my ideal price, this deal is still financially beneficial. 

Considering all these factors, accepting Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is the most strategic decision at this moment."
