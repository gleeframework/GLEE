Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""value"" of the product provides a reason for the price, even if you don't go into specifics.
* **Time Pressure (Slight):** By mentioning listing it publicly, you subtly imply Bob might miss out if he doesn't act soon.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone keeps the conversation open, inviting Bob to counter-offer if he wants.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a chance to buy the product at a price he might find reasonable."
