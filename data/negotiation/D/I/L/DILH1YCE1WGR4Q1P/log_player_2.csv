# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find useful. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200

$200 is way over your budget. It's best to try and negotiate with Alice before buying from John."

$130 is still above my budget, but it's getting closer. I'll try to negotiate a bit more before resorting to John."
