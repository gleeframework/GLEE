,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,800 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I can't go lower than $9,200. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $9,200 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
