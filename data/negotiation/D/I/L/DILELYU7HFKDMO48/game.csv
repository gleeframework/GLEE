"I'm excited to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for you, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer of $1,050,000, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a bit more profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise for me. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to make a decent profit.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. This is a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this price.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
