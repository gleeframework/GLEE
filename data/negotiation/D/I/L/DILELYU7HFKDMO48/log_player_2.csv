# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for you, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the same product from John for $1,000,000. It's better to reject her offer and see if she's willing to lower the price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer of $1,050,000, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a bit more profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what John is offering, even though she lowered the price. It's worth another round of negotiation to see if she's willing to go lower, and potentially save even more money."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise for me. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to make a decent profit.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. This is a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this price.

You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,080,000 is only $80,000 more than what you can get from John.  While it's tempting to try and negotiate further, the risk of her rejecting your next counteroffer and forcing you to buy from John for $1,000,000 is too high.  Accepting her offer is the best option in this situation."
