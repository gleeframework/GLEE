Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a good starting point, as it's a bit higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm happy to get $100,  Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $110. This is still a good price for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer, which could make him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is only $5 below my initial offer. While it's not ideal, it's still a good price, and I'd rather not risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate. I'm going to accept his offer."
