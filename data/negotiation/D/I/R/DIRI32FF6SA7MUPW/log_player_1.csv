{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $18,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value of $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more.
* **Focus on value:** I'm emphasizing the product's uniqueness to make it more desirable for Bob. 
* **Open-ended approach:** I'm not making it a hard ""take it or leave it"" offer, leaving room for counteroffers and continued negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll be closely monitoring Bob's response. 
* If he rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own.
* If the negotiation stalls, I'll be prepared to sell to John for $12,000 to avoid losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not in a rush to sell.  Here's why I'm rejecting and going for another round:

* **Negotiation is key:**  I want to see if I can get a better price. Even a small increase would be beneficial.
* **Gaining information:** Bob's willingness to negotiate shows he values the product.  I want to understand his maximum price point.
* **Potential for compromise:** By rejecting, I can signal I'm not desperate to sell at his price and might be able to find a middle ground. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll formulate a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's but still within a reasonable range.
* I'll aim for a price that's closer to my initial offer but acknowledges Bob's interest. 
* I'll be prepared to walk away if negotiations stall again, but I'm optimistic about getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12,000 is my minimum, I'd need to be closer to $15,000 to make this work for me.  It's a unique product, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and justification:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm also justifying this price with the product's unique value.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation. 
* **Focus on the future:** I'm emphasizing the potential value and return on investment for Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I'm anticipating that Bob will either accept my counteroffer or counter with a price closer to $15,000.
* I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary, but I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will lead to a successful deal. 
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to carefully consider my next move, taking into account his willingness to negotiate and the risk of selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that it's a unique product, but I'm still not sure if I'm willing to go up to $15000. How about $13500? That's the highest I'm willing to go for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has moved closer to my desired price point, and I'm getting a bit impatient. 

* **Good compromise:**  $13,500 is a significant improvement over Bob's initial offer and is a good compromise.
* **Minimizing risk:**  I'm worried about the potential of further negotiation and the possibility that Bob might decide not to purchase at all.
* **Time is money:**  I've already invested time in this negotiation, and I want to make a deal.

**Next Steps:**

* I'm going to accept this offer and move on to potentially more profitable ventures. 
* I'm satisfied with the price, and I'm happy to have secured a sale."
