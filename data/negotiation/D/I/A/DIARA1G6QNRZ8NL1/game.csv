"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we are getting closer. $9,500 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $9,125? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can close this deal.",9125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are close! I appreciate you working with me. How about $8,900? That's a significant jump from my last offer, showing how serious I am about this.",8900.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I think we're very close now.  How about we settle on $9,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it would allow us to finalize this deal.",9000.0,Alice,7,
