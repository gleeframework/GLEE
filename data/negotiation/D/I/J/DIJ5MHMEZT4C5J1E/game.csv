"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, the price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $8,200. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. Plus, I'll throw in some additional features that will make the product even more valuable to you.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $7,600?",7600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $7,600. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $8,400? This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",8400.0,Alice,5,
