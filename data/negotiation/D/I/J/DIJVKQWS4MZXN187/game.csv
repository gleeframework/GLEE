"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $9,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9250.0,Alice,5,
