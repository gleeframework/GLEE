Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I offer it elsewhere."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to the product's value to us ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering a price of $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for us.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The fact that John will buy the product for $1,200,000 gives us a strong fallback position, allowing us to be more firm in our negotiation with Bob.

**The message is crafted to:**

* **Be polite and professional.**
* **Highlight the product's value.**
* **Introduce a sense of urgency (offering it elsewhere).**"
