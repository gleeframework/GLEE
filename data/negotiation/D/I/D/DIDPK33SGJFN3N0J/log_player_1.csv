This offer represents a significant profit for you while still leaving room for negotiation. It also shows a willingness to compromise, which could lead to a smoother negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is still a significant profit for you, it's lower than your target. By rejecting, you can try to push for a price closer to your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
