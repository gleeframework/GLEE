"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that much, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $10,500?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think!",10250.0,Bob,4,
