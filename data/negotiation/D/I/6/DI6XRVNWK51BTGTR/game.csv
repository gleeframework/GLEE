"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $85? It's still a great value, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not quite ready to go down to $75. I think the product is worth a bit more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $82.50? It's still a good compromise, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.",82.5,Alice,5,
