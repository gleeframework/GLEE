"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your valuation, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price. Would you consider reducing the price to $1,200,000? This would allow me to make an offer that aligns better with my financial situation.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle - how about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. I am willing to offer $1,600,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
