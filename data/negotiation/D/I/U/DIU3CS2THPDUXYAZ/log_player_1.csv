"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to try to get a little more than $12,000 from Bob.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $12,000 is a fair price, I'm hoping for a bit more to reflect the value I see in this product.  How about $13,500?  That would be a good compromise and still give you a great deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However, $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is offering $12,500, which is more than what John is offering.  It's getting close to my minimum, so I'm going to accept his offer."
