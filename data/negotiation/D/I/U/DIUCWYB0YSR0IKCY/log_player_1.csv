Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd be interested. I'm offering it to you for $145. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate if he counters. It also leaves me room to potentially lower the price if needed while still making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum desired price, but it's still closer than my initial offer.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let's try to work something out."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to what I'm willing to pay, but I still think $137.50 is a fair price for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum desired price, but it's still below it.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to negotiate, which is great.  How about we split the difference and go with $138.50? That way, we both get a little closer to what we want."", ""product_price"": 138.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $135? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This round marks a turning point. Bob's counter-offer is still below my minimum price, and we're already halfway through the rounds.  To maximize my profit and avoid further negotiations, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  This ensures a guaranteed profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation rounds."
