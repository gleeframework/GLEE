"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really only able to pay $14,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I can do $15,500, which is a good compromise between our two prices. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
