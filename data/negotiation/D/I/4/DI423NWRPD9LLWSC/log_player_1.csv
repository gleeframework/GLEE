Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $400,000 surplus you could try to capture.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to get more than your minimum.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's appealing to Bob (saving him money compared to his valuation) while still maximizing your profit.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This offer represents a substantial saving compared to your estimated value, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,050,000 is significantly higher than your minimum but still offers Bob a $150,000 discount on his valuation.
* **Justification:** Highlighting his potential savings makes the offer more attractive.
* **Confidence:**  Projecting confidence in your offer can make Bob more likely to accept.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. You could adjust the price slightly depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to push for a higher profit margin."
