Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You want to make as much as possible, so starting at $15,000 sets a high initial bar. 
* **It's not outrageously high:**  You want to leave room for negotiation, so a price that's too high might scare Bob away immediately. 
* **It's accompanied by a friendly message:** This helps build rapport and opens the door for discussion.

Remember, you can adjust this price based on your understanding of the negotiation process and Bob's potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is your minimum, you can likely do better than that.  You want to try and squeeze out a little more profit. You will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  That gives you a good price while still allowing me to get a reasonable return on my investment.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
