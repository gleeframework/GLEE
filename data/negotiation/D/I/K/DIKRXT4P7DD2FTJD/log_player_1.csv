Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting at $10,000, I aim to maximize my potential profit. It's a strong opening offer, and I can always negotiate down. 
* **Value Unknown:**  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, a high starting point allows for more room to maneuver.
* **Plan B:**  I have a safety net with John's offer of $8,000, so I can afford to be somewhat aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  I've stated that the product is worth at least $8,000 to me. Accepting Bob's offer would mean no profit.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob is clearly interested, and his offer signals a willingness to negotiate. I can likely get a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer:** While John is a safe option, I believe I can achieve a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $9,000 is still above my minimum of $8,000, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Motivating Bob:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going and encourages Bob to come up a bit more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit:**  While $8,500 is not my ideal price, it still yields a $500 profit over my minimum.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks him walking away altogether.  It's unlikely I'll be able to get much more from him.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer is a safety net, but Bob's offer is only $500 less than John's. It's worth accepting the deal and moving on."
