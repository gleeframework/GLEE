"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to my business, but I need to be realistic about my budget. I'm willing to offer $500,000.  This leaves plenty of room for us to negotiate a price that works for both of us.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a new price of $900,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit while giving you a better deal than my initial offer. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? This would be a great deal for me and still give you a good return on the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $850,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
