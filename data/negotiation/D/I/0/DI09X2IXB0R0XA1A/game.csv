"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $7,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $6,800 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on it.",6800.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I respect your budget constraints. In order to meet in the middle, I am proposing a revised price of $7,000 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a fair transaction while making it more accessible to you.",7000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $7,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $6,900. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",6900.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your feedback, Bob. To further accommodate your budget, I am now proposing a price of $6,950 for the product. This is a slight increase from your last offer, but still below the original asking price. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both parties.",6950.0,Alice,5,
