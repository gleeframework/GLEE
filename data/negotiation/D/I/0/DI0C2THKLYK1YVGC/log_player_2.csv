"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it, but I have to be honest, I'm looking to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you'd be willing to pay. John offers the product at your target price, so it makes the most sense to buy from him."
