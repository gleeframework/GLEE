You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $12,000 to you, and Alice's offer is $15,000, so it's not a good deal. It's worth rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $10,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but it still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Alice is willing to come down from her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still above my limit.  I'm willing to negotiate further to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $11,000. This is closer to Alice's last offer, but still represents a good deal for me.  I want to show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to my price but still too high. I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm making a final counteroffer of $12,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  I'm confident that Alice will accept this offer, as it's the price she values the product at. If she rejects, I will buy from John."
