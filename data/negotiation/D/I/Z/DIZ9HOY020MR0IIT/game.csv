"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I can meet you halfway between $140 and $180, so I'm willing to offer it to you for $160. Let me know if that works for you!",160.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! I can see you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to compromise, so I'll meet you halfway between $145 and $160, which is $152.50. What do you think?",152.5,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $152.50 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $140, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you meet me at that price?",140.0,Bob,6,
