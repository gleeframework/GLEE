,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, that price is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but I'm only willing to go up to $10,000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. Let's see if we can make this work.",11500.0,Bob,4,
