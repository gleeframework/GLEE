Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to get you to lower the price.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, reminding him why he's interested in the first place. 
* **Confident but Fair:** The tone aims for confidence in the product's worth while suggesting a degree of fairness in the offer.

**Why not aim for the maximum $15,000?**

While Bob values the product at $15,000, starting at that price might scare him off. It leaves no room for negotiation and could make him feel like you're not willing to make a deal."
