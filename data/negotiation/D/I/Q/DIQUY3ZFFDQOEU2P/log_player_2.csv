"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's still very fair.  Would you be interested in paying $100 for it?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer ($100) is lower than your maximum willingness to pay ($120).**  This means you're getting a good deal.
* **It's also better than buying from John ($120).** 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial choice."
