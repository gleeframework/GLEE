Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm using positive language to create a good impression and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a potential negotiation.

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit while also being open to negotiation and avoiding a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While I could sell to John for $150, there's still potential to negotiate a better price with Bob. I'm willing to engage in further negotiation to try and reach a mutually acceptable price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $120 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This would still be a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within a reasonable range:**  $140 is a compromise between my minimum of $150 and Bob's offer of $120. 
* **Positive language:** I'm still using positive language and emphasizing the value of the product to encourage a deal.
* **Open-ended question:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, hoping to reach a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not enough:**  $130 is still below my minimum of $150. While it's closer, it's not enough of a difference to justify further negotiation.
* **John's offer is secure:** John's offer of $150 is my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose money on the sale. 
* **Time is valuable:** Further negotiation with Bob could take time, and there's no guarantee he'll eventually accept a price that meets my minimum.  

Selling to John ensures a quick and profitable sale without risking further delays or potential loss."
