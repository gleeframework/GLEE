**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently refusing to budge beyond a certain price point, and we're now at round 6 out of 10.  It's unlikely he'll suddenly agree to a price significantly closer to my $1,200,000 valuation.  Continuing the negotiation risks wasting time and potentially ending up with an even lower offer. Selling to John guarantees the full value and avoids further negotiation hassle."
