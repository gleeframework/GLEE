"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair and competitive offer, considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price, given my budget and the product's potential value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I can only go as high as $875,000.  I believe this is a fair price given our previous discussions and my financial limitations.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're committed to acquiring this product, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell the product to you for $885,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for.",885000.0,Alice,5,
