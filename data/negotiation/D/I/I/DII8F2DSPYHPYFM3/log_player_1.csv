Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to what I want.  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly. Remember, I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if I don't get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is better than selling to John, but it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a higher price through a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,700,000.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaving some room for a final agreement that's closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good deal. It's higher than what I'd get from John, and we've been through a few rounds of negotiation already.  It's time to accept and move on."
