"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $10,500? It's a fair price that would give us both a good deal. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
