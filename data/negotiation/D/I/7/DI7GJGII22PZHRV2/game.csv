"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $1,250,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we settle at $1,275,000?  It's a fair compromise.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a compromise.  While $1,275,000 is a step in the right direction, I need to be closer to $1,300,000 to make this work.  How about we meet at $1,290,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",1290000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  $1,290,000 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,280,000. This is a fair offer considering we are getting close to my limit.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  $1,280,000 is getting close, but I'm still a bit short.  To make this work, I need to be at $1,295,000. It's a small difference, and it would give us both a fair deal.  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for your business.",1295000.0,Alice,7,
