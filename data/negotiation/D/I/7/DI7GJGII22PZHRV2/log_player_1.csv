"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for both of us, which can make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message clearly indicates that I'm open to negotiation, which can encourage Bob to engage. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to establish a starting point for negotiation. By offering a price above Bob's perceived value, I can potentially extract a higher price.  I'll then assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,250,000 is better than Bob's initial assessment of $1,200,000, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to settle for that amount yet. 

**Strategy:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counteroffer in the next round. I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,400,000, but I'll also consider the limited rounds remaining and the potential of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your position, $1,250,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and demonstrating a willingness to compromise by moving closer to his price. 
* **Splitting the difference:** I'm suggesting a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($1,250,000). This strategy can feel fair to Bob.
* **Value proposition:** I'm reminding Bob that he's still getting a good deal at this price. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still remaining close to my minimum desired price.  I'm also trying to maintain a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to agree. I'll carefully assess his response to determine my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we settle at $1,275,000?  It's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price than his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum target of $1,500,000.  Selling to John would be a much more profitable option, and I'm not yet ready to give up on the negotiation with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds. My next counteroffer will likely be closer to Bob's offer, but I'll still try to hold out for a price closer to $1,300,000. I'll also need to carefully consider the remaining rounds and the potential for selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a compromise.  While $1,275,000 is a step in the right direction, I need to be closer to $1,300,000 to make this work.  How about we meet at $1,290,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1290000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small compromise:** I'm making a small concession to Bob's offer by moving closer to his desired price. 
* **Value justification:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify my proposed price.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair solution for both of us.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our positions while still remaining within my minimum desired price range. With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to balance my desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal to Bob or being forced to sell to John. I'll closely analyze Bob's response to determine my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  $1,290,000 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,280,000. This is a fair offer considering we are getting close to my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum target of $1,500,000.  Selling to John would be more profitable.  With only 4 rounds left, I want to see if I can squeeze a little more out of Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counteroffer once more, aiming for a price closer to $1,300,000.  I'll emphasize the value of the product and try to find a compromise that meets both of our needs.  However, I'm also carefully considering the potential of selling to John if negotiations with Bob fall apart."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  $1,280,000 is getting close, but I'm still a bit short.  To make this work, I need to be at $1,295,000. It's a small difference, and it would give us both a fair deal.  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for your business."", ""product_price"": 1295000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small Increment:**  I'm only raising my offer by $15,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm again highlighting the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Finality:**  I'm subtly implying that this might be my final offer, adding pressure on Bob.

**Strategy:**

With 3 rounds remaining, I'm aiming for a price close to my desired range. I'm hoping Bob will agree, but I'm also prepared to accept his offer if the next round fails. If that happens, I'll likely choose to sell to John."
