"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,500,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  How about we meet in the middle? I propose $1,875,000.",1875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I propose $1,687,500. Can we agree on this price?",1687500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,687,500 is closer to what I envision, I need to be mindful of the product's true value. Let's settle at $1,781,250.  This reflects a reasonable compromise for both of us.",1781250.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I propose $1,700,000. This is the highest I can go without exceeding my budget. Can we agree on this price?",1700000.0,Bob,6,
