"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to start with an offer of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $12,500? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I really think the product is worth more than $11,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $13,000? It's a fair price that I think reflects the product's value, and it's still a good deal for you.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",11500.0,Bob,6,
