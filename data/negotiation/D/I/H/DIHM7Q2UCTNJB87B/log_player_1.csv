Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $18,000. This is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but closer to Bob's offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate.  I hope this price will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price. There's no guarantee that I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate."
