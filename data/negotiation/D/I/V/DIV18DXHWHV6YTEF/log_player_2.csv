I'm willing to offer it to you for $725,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?

Alice is clearly signaling this is her final offer. While I could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of her refusing and me having to buy from John at $1,200,000.  $725,000 is a good price and within my acceptable range."
