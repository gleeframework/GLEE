Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly lower allows for potential profit from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still represents a potential ""deal"" compared to your fallback option. 
* **Open Negotiation:** The message invites a response from Bob, leaving room for counter-offers or further discussion.

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, you increase the chances of securing a higher profit than your guaranteed sale."
