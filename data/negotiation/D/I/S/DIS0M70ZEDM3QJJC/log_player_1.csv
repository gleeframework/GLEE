Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm setting the price at $11,500."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she needs to incentivize Bob to buy.
* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so Alice needs to offer a price that's appealing but still profitable for her.
* **Time Value & Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John guarantees $12,000, so offering a price slightly below that to Bob acknowledges the potential for a faster sale. 

By offering the product at $11,500, Alice creates a win-win scenario:

* **Bob:**  Gets the product for $1,500 less than its perceived value to him.
* **Alice:** Earns a $1,500 profit and potentially avoids the time and effort of finding another buyer."
