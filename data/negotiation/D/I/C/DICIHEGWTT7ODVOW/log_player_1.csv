Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $100.
* **John as Backup:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John if Bob refuses.

Offering the product at $119 gives Bob a chance to gain some value ($11 saved compared to his perceived value) while still maximizing Alice's potential profit. It's unlikely Bob would accept a price closer to $120, knowing he could get it for $100 elsewhere."
