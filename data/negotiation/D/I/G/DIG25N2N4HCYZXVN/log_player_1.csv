Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $11500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $10500 for the product.  This price is still within my budget, but allows for some room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
