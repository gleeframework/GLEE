Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $119."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob before resorting to selling to John at $120.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's buying price ($119) creates a sense of urgency and potential value for Bob. While it's more than Bob inherently values the product at, it's possible he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives it as a good deal he might miss out on. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, starting slightly high leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or willingness to pay more than his perceived value."
