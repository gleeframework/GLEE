"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Since Bob has a higher limit with John, he can afford to negotiate further with Alice to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you understanding the value to me.  However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This would still give you a decent profit and allow me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,250. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to his ideal price, it's still higher than his preferred target. Bob can continue negotiating with Alice and potentially secure an even better deal. He also has the fallback option of buying from John if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,250 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a fair compromise, given my budget and the value to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate the effort. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'll offer you the product for $11,100. This is a final compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still $400 higher than his preferred target. At this point, Bob has negotiated as much as he can with Alice. Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but it's not guaranteed. Bob has a clear fallback option with John, who is willing to sell the product for $12,000. Since Alice's final offer is still above Bob's comfortable spending limit, he decides to stop negotiating and purchase the product from John for $12,000. This ensures Bob gets the product and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a higher price."
