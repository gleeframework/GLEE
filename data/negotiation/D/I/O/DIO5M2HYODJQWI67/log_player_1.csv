Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get the highest price possible from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** I know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John.

Therefore, I'm starting with a price of $175. This allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle, but still ensures I make a profit above my minimum."
