"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for you than buying from John.** You'd pay $140 from Alice, while John wants $150.
* **While you could try to negotiate with Alice, there's no guarantee of a better deal.** There's no reason to risk losing the product altogether by rejecting her offer."
