{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a fantastic deal, given its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer gives you a substantial profit while also being appealing to Bob, as he still gets a $50,000 savings. It sets the stage for negotiation while keeping John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its true worth to me. How about $750,000? This would allow us to both benefit from the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $750,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still allows for a good profit for both of us.  Let's find a way to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer carefully. While I understand your position, I would like to propose $800,000 as a fair price for the product. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while keeping within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, accepting his offer ensures I meet my financial goal and avoids the risk of further negotiations that might lead to a lower price or a failed deal altogether."
