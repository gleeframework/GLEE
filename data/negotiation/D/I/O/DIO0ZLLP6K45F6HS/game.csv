"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $90.  This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price.  Let's work together to make this happen!",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $75? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 is just not enough for me.  Let's meet halfway again - I'll offer you the product for $85.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.  What do you say?",85.0,Alice,5,
