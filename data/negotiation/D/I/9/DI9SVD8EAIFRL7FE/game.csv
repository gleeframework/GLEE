"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is still quite low.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a good deal. Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still too far from what I need to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This would be a fair compromise, and it would give you a great deal on a valuable product. Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your efforts to reach a deal, but $10,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm going to offer a final price of $9,750. This reflects my maximum willingness to pay and represents a significant concession from my previous offer. Let's see if we can make this work.",9750.0,Bob,6,
