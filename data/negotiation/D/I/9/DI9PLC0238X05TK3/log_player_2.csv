"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $130. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price. Alice is starting high.  You are willing to walk away and buy from John, so you have leverage."
