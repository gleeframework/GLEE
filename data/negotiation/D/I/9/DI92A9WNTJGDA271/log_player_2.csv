"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know you'll find extremely valuable.  It's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement that benefits us both.  Let's discuss a price that's fair to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still costs more than what the product is worth to Bob. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can then purchase the product from John for $1,500,000, which is within his budget and aligns with his goal of saving money."
