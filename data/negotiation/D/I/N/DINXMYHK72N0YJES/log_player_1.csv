Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000 vs. $8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""significant value"" to encourage Bob to consider the higher price.
* **Safety Net:** I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I can sell the product for at least $8,000 if Bob declines.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Excellent! I earn more than my minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  We can negotiate a price within his range while still aiming for a price above $8,000.
* **Bob Rejects:**  I sell the product to John for my minimum acceptable price.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging the possibility of selling to John at my baseline price."
