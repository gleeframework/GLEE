"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I could go up to $725,000. That's a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about $837,500? This meets us halfway between our last two offers and represents a significant discount on my initial price.",837500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see that we're getting closer. While $837,500 is closer to what I can do, it's still a bit of a stretch. I'd be willing to settle at $780,000. This would be a significant investment for me, but I believe it's a fair price that respects the value of your product.",780000.0,Bob,6,
