"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** The message frames the price as related to the product's ""unique features and potential,"" subtly implying there's more value than Bob might initially see.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking ""What do you think?"" I invite Bob to engage in the negotiation process. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:** If Bob accepts my initial high offer, I gain the most.
2. **Gather Information:**  Bob's response will reveal how eager he is to buy and give me insights for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While his message indicates interest, accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially with the safety net of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is considerably higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant drop from my initial price ($250,000 reduction) to demonstrate flexibility and signal that I'm open to negotiation. 
* **Holding Firm:** Despite the concession, my price is still significantly above Bob's offer and comfortably above my minimum. I want to see how much he's willing to move.
* **Justification:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the still-high price. This aims to nudge Bob towards my valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind. I could stretch to $1,200,000. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met his own perceived value of the product but is still below my minimum of $1,500,000. While he's stating it's his ""final offer,"" there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to push a bit further.  The risk of losing him is somewhat mitigated by John's standing offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being upfront about your budget constraints. I'm aiming for a deal that works for both of us. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,450,000?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer splits the difference between Bob's last offer ($1,200,000) and my previous counteroffer ($1,750,000). 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By saying ""Let's meet in the middle,"" I'm suggesting that this is a fair compromise and encouraging a quicker resolution.
* **Slightly Above Minimum:** I'm still aiming for a price above my absolute minimum to maximize potential profit, but I'm moving closer to an acceptable range for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me.  I can do $1,300,000. I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now offered $1,300,000, which is above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000 and a reasonable profit. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that:

* **Bob Walks:** He might be losing patience and decide to walk away from the deal entirely.
* **Stalemate:**  We might get stuck in a back-and-forth with diminishing returns.

Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit and avoids the potential downsides of continued negotiation."
