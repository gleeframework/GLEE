"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $100 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125?  It's still a great price for this product, and it would allow us both to walk away happy.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.",112.5,Bob,4,
