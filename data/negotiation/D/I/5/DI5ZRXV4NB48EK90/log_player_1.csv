{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  Given its unique value, I'm asking for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,400,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down slightly. I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. I think this is a fair compromise given the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a great opportunity. Bob's offer matches John's price, and we're already in round 4, meaning we have limited time to negotiate further. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing time or getting a worse price."
