"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $110. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While $110 is lower than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. This might encourage her to propose a lower price, closer to her product's value of $80. If not, you still have the option to buy from John for $120."
