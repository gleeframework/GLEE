"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value and the impact it could have on your operations, I'm offering it to you at an exclusive price of $11,000. This is a special opportunity tailored to recognize your interest and commitment. Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is higher than her product valuation ($10,000), it's still less than your maximum budget of $12,000 and the price John offers. Accepting this offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John."
