"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll get a great value out of it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's message is tempting, $1,100,000 is significantly more than your maximum budget and what John offers. You can save a considerable amount of money by going with John."
