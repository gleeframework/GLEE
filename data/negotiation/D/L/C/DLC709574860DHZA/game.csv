"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $95? ",95.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I need to make a profit. I can do $110, which is the lowest I can go for now.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to go for $105, and that would be a fair deal for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, but I still need to make a profit. I can meet you halfway between $105 and my last offer of $110, so I'll do $107.50. That's the best I can do.",107.5,Alice,5,
