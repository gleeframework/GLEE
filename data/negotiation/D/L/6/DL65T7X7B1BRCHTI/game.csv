"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $9,500 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  This is my best offer, as I'm confident I can find a similar product elsewhere for that price.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. To better align with your financial considerations while still valuing the product's true worth, I am willing to negotiate down to $9,000 for the product. I believe this price offers a fair compromise, allowing us to move forward with the transaction while staying within your budget.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident I can find a comparable product for $8,250. If you're serious about selling, this is my final offer.",8250.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $8,750 is closer, but I'm still hoping for something closer to my initial budget.  Would you consider $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.",8500.0,Bob,6,
