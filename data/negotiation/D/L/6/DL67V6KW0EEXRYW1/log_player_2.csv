"Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $80 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $175. This is far above Bob's maximum value. It makes sense to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
``` 
This offer reflects Bob's maximum value for the product.  It's unlikely Alice will accept, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $125 is closer to Bob's maximum value, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  Rejecting and counteroffering again is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
``` 

This offer is a compromise between Bob's maximum value and Alice's previous offer. It shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is still trying to get a good deal."
