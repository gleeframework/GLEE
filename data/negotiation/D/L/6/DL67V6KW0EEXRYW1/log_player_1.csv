Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I'm willing to accept from John, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'm confident that the product is worth more to Bob than $80, so there's room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to accept it. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to show good faith, but I'm still holding out for a profit. I believe $125 is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product to Bob while allowing me to earn a decent return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to budge much. While I could continue negotiating, I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price and I don't want to risk losing the deal with John.  Selling to John guarantees me a decent profit, so I'll take that option."
