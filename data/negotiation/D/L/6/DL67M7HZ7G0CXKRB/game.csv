"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $80 for it.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell the product to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $110 is still a little out of my range.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  That's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $95 and sell the product to you for $102.50. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  While $102.50 is better, I'm still hoping to get it for $90.  I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $97.50. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as I still need to make a profit. What do you think?",97.5,Alice,7,
