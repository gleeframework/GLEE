Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,500.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations slightly above your target price. This leaves room for potential compromise while still aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value and potential,"" Alice subtly justifies the higher price without revealing her true minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing ""initially proposing"" and ""What do you think?"" signals to Bob that Alice is open to discussing the price and potentially negotiating.

**Goal:** 

The goal is to ascertain if Bob is willing to pay a premium for exclusivity and early access. If he rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John, ensuring she doesn't lose out."
