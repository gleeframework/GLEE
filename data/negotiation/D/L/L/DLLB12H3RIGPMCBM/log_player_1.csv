"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. That said, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $950,000? I think that's a fair offer considering its true value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's not worth the risk of him lowballing me further. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  It's time to make the safe and profitable choice."
