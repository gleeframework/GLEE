"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you being interested.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $125?  That's still a good deal for you, and it helps me get closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and getting the product for $120 from John is the best possible outcome.  There's no point in risking further negotiation with Alice."
