Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are aiming to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above your desired price point. It is better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, and it's still within my budget.  It's a good starting point for negotiation and shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has matched my counteroffer, and $10,500 is within my budget and a good deal.  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially end up buying from John at a higher price."
