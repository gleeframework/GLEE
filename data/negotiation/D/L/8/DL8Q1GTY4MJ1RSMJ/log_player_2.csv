"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  Is there any room to negotiate?  I'm really interested in the product, so I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible. While $9,000 is a better deal than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise, and Bob can likely get a slightly lower price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference at $8,500?  That way we're both getting a fair price."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more profit. I can offer it to you for $9,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer is a Good Deal:**  $9,250 is significantly lower than John's price of $12,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 5 rounds left, there's a risk that further negotiation will fail, and Bob would be forced to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Final Offer:** Alice has explicitly stated this is her final offer.  Further negotiation might just waste time. 

While Bob might be able to squeeze out a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John outweighs the potential savings. Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible move."
