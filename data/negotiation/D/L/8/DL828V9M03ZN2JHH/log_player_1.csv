Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering its significance in the market.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 to John, it's always best to aim higher initially.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, but I'll still be above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong Initial Stance:** A high initial price conveys the product's value and my confidence in it. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limits beyond the product's value to him."
