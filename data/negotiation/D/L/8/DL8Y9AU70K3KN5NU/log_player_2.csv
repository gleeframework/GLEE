You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is tempting, it's still a significant markup from her own valuation of $800,000.  By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a better price or proceed with your backup option:

* **Negotiation:** Alice might be willing to lower her price to avoid losing the sale entirely. 
* **John's Offer:** Buying from John for $1,200,000 is your absolute maximum, but it's better to try for a lower price first."
