"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its unique value, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000.  What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is way out of my budget. This product would be valuable to me, but  $22,000 is simply too high.  Would you consider something closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $16,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me.  How about we try $12,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is still quite low, however.  To move things along, I'd be willing to accept $14,000.  This is my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a fair product, but $14,000 is just too much for me.  I could go up to $12,500, but that's absolutely my limit.",12500.0,Bob,6,
