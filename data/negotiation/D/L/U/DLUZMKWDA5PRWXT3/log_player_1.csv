"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000 to gauge Bob's interest. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,000 is a decent profit, it's still below my desired price point. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profit higher than $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to go much higher.  Accepting his offer at $17,000 secures a good profit, and it's still significantly better than selling to John for $15,000.  There's a risk of getting a better offer in the future, but the longer the negotiation goes on, the more likely it is to collapse."
