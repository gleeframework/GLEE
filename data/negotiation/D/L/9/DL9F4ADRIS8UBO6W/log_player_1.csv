Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit if he accepts the initial price.
* **Avoid a Lowball:** Offering a price too close to John's $80 backup offer ($85 for example) leaves potential profit on the table. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
