"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good price, it's still a significant amount of money. Since you have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer of $600,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price and shows my willingness to negotiate. It's likely Alice will reject this offer, but it will give me a good starting point for further negotiation in the next rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but $750,000 is still too high.  I believe I can push for a lower price with a counteroffer, as I have several more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $700,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but still want a better price. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise that Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $725,000 is getting closer to my ideal price.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and potentially raising her price again is too high. With only 5 rounds remaining, it's safer to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
