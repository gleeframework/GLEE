Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value and could be a great asset to you. I'm willing to part with it for $14,999. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to push Bob as close to that amount as possible.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high gives you room to negotiate if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By implying the product's value and your willingness to sell, you might encourage Bob to act quickly rather than overthink the offer.

**Important Note:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, there's a good chance you can still negotiate a price higher than $8,000, especially since he knows you have another buyer lined up."
