"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming to maximize my profit.  I'll see if Bob is willing to bite, but I'm ready to lower the price if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $140 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
``` 

I'm lowering the price a bit to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a profit.  Hopefully, this offer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum acceptable price.  I'm happy to close the deal and get $150 for the product.  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with less."
