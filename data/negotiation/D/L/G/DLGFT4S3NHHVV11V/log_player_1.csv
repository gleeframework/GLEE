"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I think the product is worth a lot to me, but I'm not willing to pay $900,000. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  The product's value to me is higher than $750,000. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're not willing to go down to $750,000, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $775,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired target. I'm not willing to accept an offer that's less than $800,000 yet.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to compromise further, but $775,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $812,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 812500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $812,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $790,000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $790,000 is getting closer to my desired price, we've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significant improvement.  I've already gone through several rounds and feel like I've made enough concessions.  Selling to John at $800,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
