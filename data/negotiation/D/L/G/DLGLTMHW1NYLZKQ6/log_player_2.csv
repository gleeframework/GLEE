# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I see in the product, but also acknowledges your budget constraints. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.
