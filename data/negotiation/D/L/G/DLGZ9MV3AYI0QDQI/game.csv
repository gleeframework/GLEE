"Bob, I'm confident that this product is a valuable asset for your company, and I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $850,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it still offers you a great value for the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your proposal, Alice. While I understand your position, I am unable to meet the price of $900,000. I am prepared to offer $875,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer meets your needs and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",875000.0,Bob,4,
