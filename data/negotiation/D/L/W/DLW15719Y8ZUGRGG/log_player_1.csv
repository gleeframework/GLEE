Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm confident it would be valuable to you. I'm proposing a price of $16,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 16000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response will be telling. If he outright rejects the offer, you can significantly lower the price. If he counters, you know he's interested and can negotiate from there. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so you're not desperate. This allows you to be more assertive in your initial asking price with Bob."
