"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $110
* **Your Maximum:** $120
* **John's Price:** $120

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $10 compared to buying from John.  While you could try to negotiate with Alice further, it's likely she won't go lower than her own value of $100."
