"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value, but it's still a good starting point that allows room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to come close to my minimum value before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's significantly below my minimum value, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $1,000,000. This is still above my minimum value but shows I'm willing to compromise. I hope this will encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below it.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I want to try to push for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $975,000. This is a small concession from my last offer, but it shows that I'm willing to be flexible. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are nearing the end of our rounds and Bob has not shown much willingness to budge. It is becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach a price I am comfortable with. To avoid potentially ending up with a price I am unsatisfied with, I will sell to John.  This ensures I get my minimum desired value."
