Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a chance to acquire a valuable asset."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a significantly higher price than your minimum ($1,200,000 vs. $800,000) sets a strong anchor point. This can make Bob more receptive to a lower counter-offer, even if it's still above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The high initial price leaves space for Bob to negotiate, making him feel more involved in the process. This can increase his willingness to ultimately agree on a price.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 from John, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response."
