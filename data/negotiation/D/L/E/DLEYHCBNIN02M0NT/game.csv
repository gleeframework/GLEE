"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to make a profit.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a deal, but I was hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm going to counter with a price of $1,300,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get the product, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This offer is a significant step closer to your target price, and it would allow us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,250,000. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm going to counter with a price of $1,280,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price.  While $1,280,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that fits my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,260,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer and demonstrates my commitment to a mutually beneficial deal.",1260000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I still need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to compromise further and counter with a price of $1,290,000. This is a reasonable offer that I think is fair for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",1290000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,300,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm willing to sell the product at this price. I'm hoping you'll accept it and we can finalize the deal.",1300000.0,Alice,9,
