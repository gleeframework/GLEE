"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is still too high. It's worth exploring if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a deal, but I was hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm going to counter with a price of $1,300,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get the product, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This offer is a significant step closer to your target price, and it would allow us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,250,000. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm going to counter with a price of $1,280,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While Alice's offer is lower, it's still higher than Bob's preferred price.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a fair price.  While $1,280,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that fits my budget.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I still need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to compromise further and counter with a price of $1,290,000. This is a reasonable offer that I think is fair for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money.  Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still higher than Bob's preferred price. Bob has already explored the price with John, who is willing to sell for $1,000,000, and this is still a better option than Alice's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price that fits my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,270,000.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,300,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm willing to sell the product at this price. I'm hoping you'll accept it and we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated that $1,300,000 is her lowest price.  There's only one round remaining, and Bob is unlikely to get a better deal with Alice. It's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John for $1,000,000, which is a significantly lower price."
