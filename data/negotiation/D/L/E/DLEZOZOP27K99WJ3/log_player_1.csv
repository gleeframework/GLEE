Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to make a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a good starting point.** It's a significant discount from your minimum value ($15,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly and open.** It acknowledges the product's value to you, but also expresses your willingness to negotiate. 
* **This strategy aims to:**
    * Gauge Bob's interest.
    * Potentially get a quick sale at a price that's good for you. 
    * Set the stage for further negotiation if Bob counters. 

Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  It's significantly below your minimum value of $15,000 and even below what the product is worth to him ($10,000). Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation.**  You can counter with a price closer to your desired value, potentially finding a middle ground.
* **Selling to John is always an option, but not the best choice yet.**  You've already invested some time in negotiating with Bob, and you might be able to reach a better price than $15,000 through further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

You will need to send a counteroffer to Bob. A good strategy would be to counter with a price slightly lower than your initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. For example, you could offer $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is above Bob's offer but below your initial offer.** This shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting your interests. 
* **The message is friendly and emphasizes a win-win situation.** It highlights the value for both parties.
* **$10,500 is a reasonable compromise.** It's a fair middle ground that could potentially lead to a quick agreement. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob accepts, the deal is done! If he rejects, you can decide whether to make another counteroffer, or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  I'm trying to stick to a tight budget.  Could you do $9,750? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While closer to your minimum, it's still below what the product is worth to him, and it's not a price you're comfortable with.
* **Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going.** It allows you to try to reach a more favorable price. 
* **Selling to John is a tempting option, but not the best choice yet.** You're close to a deal with Bob, and further negotiation might get you closer to your desired price.

**Next Steps:**

You should send a counteroffer to Bob.  You could try a slight increase from his last offer, aiming for a price around $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  $10,000 is my final offer.  This price is fair for both of us, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer signals a strong commitment to closing the deal while still being within a reasonable range. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** The message highlights the mutually beneficial aspects of the deal, encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Slight Increase from Bob's Offer:** $10,000 is a small increase from Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise while keeping your interests in mind.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob accepts, the deal is done! If he rejects, you will need to decide whether to sell to John or make another counteroffer. However, since this is presented as your final offer, it's a good time to consider selling to John if Bob rejects."
