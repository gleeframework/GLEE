"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth $18,000. I'm open to negotiation, but I won't go below $15,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget, $10,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000. I'm still a bit above my budget, though. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're still a bit away from my price. To be honest, I'm starting to feel like this isn't going to work. I'm willing to come down to $14,000 for this round, but if we can't find a mutually agreeable price soon, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm still really interested in the product.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's my absolute limit. Let's see if we can make this work.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer!  $13,000 is a good offer, but I'm still holding out for a little more.  How about $13,500?  If you're not willing to go that high, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.  This is my final offer.",13500.0,Alice,7,
