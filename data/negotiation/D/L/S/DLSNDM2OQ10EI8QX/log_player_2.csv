"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth $18,000. I'm open to negotiation, but I won't go below $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way above his maximum budget of $10,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Direct and clear:**  Bob states his budget directly and clearly to Alice, establishing his negotiation stance.
* **Expresses interest:** By stating he's ""really interested in the product,"" Bob shows he's motivated to buy but is sticking to his financial limits.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  While offering his lowest price, Bob doesn't close the door completely. This allows Alice the space to counter with a slightly higher offer, potentially finding a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget, $10,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit.  He should continue negotiating with Alice to try and get a lower price.  He can potentially counter with a slightly higher offer to see if they can find a middle ground, keeping in mind that he can always buy from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000. I'm still a bit above my budget, though. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Is that something you'd be willing to consider?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Shows progress:** Bob acknowledges Alice's concession and expresses his own willingness to compromise.
* **Gradual increase:**  He increases his offer by $2,000, demonstrating that he's taking her counteroffers seriously.
* **Open-ended question:**  By asking if she's ""willing to consider,"" Bob leaves the door open for further discussion and negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're still a bit away from my price. To be honest, I'm starting to feel like this isn't going to work. I'm willing to come down to $14,000 for this round, but if we can't find a mutually agreeable price soon, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to the limit:** $14,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still $4,000 over his ideal price. 
* **Time pressure:** Alice is starting to put pressure on the negotiation, suggesting that she may move on to other buyers if they don't reach an agreement soon.
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's still potential for Bob to negotiate a lower price, and he has several rounds left.

Bob should reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the next round. He could counter with a slightly higher offer, perhaps $13,000, and see if he can close the gap. If Alice rejects that offer, he'll have to seriously consider whether buying from John at $10,000 is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, and I'm still really interested in the product.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's my absolute limit. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge pressure:** Bob acknowledges Alice's concerns about finding a mutually agreeable price, showing he's taking her stance seriously.
* **Final offer:**  He clearly states that $13,000 is his ""absolute limit,"" signaling that he's prepared to walk away if she rejects this offer.
* **Open to compromise:**  While stating his limit, he still leaves the door open for a slight negotiation by saying ""let's see if we can make this work.""

This counteroffer balances firmness with a willingness to compromise, giving Alice a final chance to reach a deal before Bob potentially turns to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer!  $13,000 is a good offer, but I'm still holding out for a little more.  How about $13,500?  If you're not willing to go that high, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is putting a lot of pressure on Bob, and while $13,500 is getting closer to his limit, it's still above his ideal price.  He's already been through several rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that Alice is unwilling to go lower.  

It's time for Bob to cut his losses.  Buying from John for $10,000 is the best option at this point. It saves him $3,500 compared to accepting Alice's offer and ensures he gets the product within his budget.  While he might have been able to negotiate a slightly better price with Alice, the risk of further negotiation failing and losing the product entirely outweighs the potential for a small saving."
