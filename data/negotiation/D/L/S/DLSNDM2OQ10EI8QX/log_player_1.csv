"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth $18,000. I'm open to negotiation, but I won't go below $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I'm also making it clear that I have a minimum price, setting the stage for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget, $10,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm also highlighting my willingness to compromise, hoping to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000. I'm still a bit above my budget, though. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still offering too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round, but if he doesn't come closer to my minimum, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're still a bit away from my price. To be honest, I'm starting to feel like this isn't going to work. I'm willing to come down to $14,000 for this round, but if we can't find a mutually agreeable price soon, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm making a significant concession to $14,000, but I'm also putting pressure on Bob by implying that I'm close to walking away.  This is my last significant offer before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I'm still really interested in the product.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's my absolute limit. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm tempted to accept Bob's offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, but if he doesn't budge, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  $13,000 is a good offer, but I'm still holding out for a little more.  How about $13,500?  If you're not willing to go that high, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer, aiming for a price that's almost halfway between Bob's offer and my minimum. I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.  This is a high-stakes situation, and if this offer is rejected, I'm prepared to sell to John."
