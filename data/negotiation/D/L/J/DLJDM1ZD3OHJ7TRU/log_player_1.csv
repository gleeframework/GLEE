"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a price higher than my minimum value to give myself room for negotiation. 
* **Showing Flexibility:**  I'm emphasizing my willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to engage.

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. I'll adapt my strategy based on Bob's responses and the progression of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe $18000 would be a fair price for me considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While closer to my minimum, $18,000 is still below my ideal selling price. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room to increase the price through further negotiation.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John now would guarantee $15,000, but I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob for the potential of a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. While $18,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $19,000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 19000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm presenting a counteroffer that's a midpoint between my initial price and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" and a ""win-win"" scenario to make the offer more appealing.
* **Finality:** While open to further negotiation, I'm aiming to close the deal in this round.  I'm confident that $19,000 is a good price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose $17500 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** $17,500 is getting closer to my minimum, but still below my ideal price. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I'm not sure if Bob will budge much more, but I want to explore if I can get closer to $18,000 before considering selling to John.
* **Risk Assessment:** While selling to John is always an option, I still see some potential for a deal with Bob that's more profitable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $17,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more. How about we settle on $18,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finally close this deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's right in the middle between my previous offer and Bob's last offer.
* **Closing Tone:** My message is  more direct and emphasizes the finality of the deal. 
* **Increased Pressure:** I'm subtly putting the pressure on Bob to close the deal, as I'm only willing to come down a small amount further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. Based on my budget, I would like to propose $18000 for the product. This seems to be a reasonable compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob has come up to $18,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Factor:** We're halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale. 
* **Potential for John:** While I could try to get a slightly higher price, it's not guaranteed, and I'm wary of risking further negotiation. Selling to John is always an option, but I'd rather secure a sale with Bob at my minimum price."
