Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $12,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still a gap between your offer and Bob's perceived value, which allows for potential counteroffers and a chance to reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Remember:** If Bob rejects your offer, you can always counter with a higher price, or if you feel he's not serious, you can move on to John and sell the product for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to Bob. There's room for negotiation, and you can likely get a higher price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away if the price isn't right, which can put pressure on Bob to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $9,000 is a fair offer, I need a bit more to make this deal work. How about $10,500? This would be a great price for you, considering the value you'll get from this product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet Bob halfway:** This counteroffer is halfway between your previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000.  
* **Show willingness to negotiate:** This demonstrates flexibility and a desire to find a solution.
* **Highlight the product's value:**  You emphasize the value Bob will gain, potentially pushing him to reconsider his initial offer.

**Remember:**  If Bob rejects your counteroffer, you can always go back to John and sell for $8,000. You're now in a stronger position, knowing that Bob is interested and you have a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal for you.  $10,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $8,000 and closer to your initial asking price of $12,000.

* **You've made progress:** You've successfully negotiated a higher price from Bob's initial offer of $9,000.
* **Limited upside:** It's unlikely you'll be able to get much more from Bob, and pushing further could risk him walking away completely.
* **Securing the deal:** Accepting the offer ensures you'll make a good profit, and you'll avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation.

While you might be tempted to try for a higher price, $10,000 is a solid outcome considering the circumstances."
