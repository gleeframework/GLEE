"While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time. This reflects the maximum value I see in the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is your maximum offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. While I appreciate the offer, $1,000,000 is still beyond my current budget. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product, reflecting the value I see in it and my current financial capacity.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think that we're close, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  $950,000 is closer, but still slightly above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  To demonstrate my genuine interest, I'm willing to offer $925,000 for the product. This represents a significant step towards a deal, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both see in this opportunity.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a significant profit. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package and a 6-month warranty. I believe this will add significant value to the product and justify the price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $925,000, but I expect you to take the extras into consideration.",925000.0,Alice,7,
