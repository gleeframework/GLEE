# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is your maximum offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, $950,000 is still a bit too high. It's worth pushing for a lower price, but I need to be mindful of the number of rounds left. If I can't get a price closer to my target, I might need to consider buying from John."

# Alice's message: I can see that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a significant profit. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package and a 6-month warranty. I believe this will add significant value to the product and justify the price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally reached my counteroffer of $925,000. While I would prefer a lower price, it's getting close to my budget, and the added value of the support package and warranty make this offer more appealing. With only a few rounds remaining, it's a good deal that avoids the risk of failing to reach an agreement and having to buy from John."
