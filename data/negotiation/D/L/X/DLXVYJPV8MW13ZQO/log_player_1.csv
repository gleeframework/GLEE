{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**  Bob has indicated this is his final offer.  His offer is less than John's standing offer. It's unlikely further negotiation will close the gap significantly enough in the remaining rounds. Accepting John's offer ensures a guaranteed sale at your minimum acceptable price."
