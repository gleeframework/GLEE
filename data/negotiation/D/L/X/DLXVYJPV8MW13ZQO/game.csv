"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,125,000 for the product.",1125000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,125,000 is quite a way off from what I can accept. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I agree the product is valuable, my budget is firm. I could do $1,312,500.  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",1312500.0,Bob,4,
