Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, it's always good to aim higher initially. Bob might be willing to pay a premium for exclusivity and a quicker deal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** A starting price of $12,000 allows room for potential negotiation. If Bob counters, you can strategically lower the price, making him feel like he's getting a better deal. 
* **Justify the Price:**  Mentioning ""value"" and ""interest from others"" creates a sense of desirability and scarcity, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept your offer.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still being realistic about Bob's valuation of the product."
