"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product! Given its value, I'm asking for $25,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $25,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but $18,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $21,000? It's a competitive price for a product of this quality.",21000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $21,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $19,500. Can you consider that?",19500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $19,500 is close, but I need to get at least $20,500 for it to make sense for me.  This is my final offer.",20500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best price, but $20,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $19,000, but that's my final offer. If you can meet me at that price, I'd be happy to buy the product from you.",19000.0,Bob,6,
