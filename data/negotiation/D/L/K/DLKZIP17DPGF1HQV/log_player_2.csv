"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make this deal happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you have another option with John at $15,000.  There's a chance you could get a better price from Alice if you reject her first offer. By rejecting, you signal that you're willing to walk away and might encourage her to come down closer to her $12,000 valuation."
