# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a special price, knowing it's valuable to you. I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, but I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair offer. Let me know if you're interested!
