"Alice, your offer is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  This represents a significant investment for me and aligns with my budget constraints.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your perspective.  While that offer is significantly below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to work with you.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit higher than my ideal price point.  Would you be willing to come down to $900,000? I believe this is a fair compromise and a good starting point for us both.",900000.0,Bob,4,
