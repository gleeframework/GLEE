Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm close to my minimum price, but I'm not willing to sell for $145. I can offer you a slight discount at $158, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me here.

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is unlikely to go below $155, and her latest offer is even higher than before. John offers a guaranteed price of $150, which is a better deal at this point."
