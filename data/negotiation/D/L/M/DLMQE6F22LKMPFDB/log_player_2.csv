"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a price closer to what it's worth to me.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is closer to her desired price, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000.  Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to reject Alice's offer and purchase from John."
