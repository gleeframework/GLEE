"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is lower than what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This would give you a good deal, and still allow me to recover some of my costs.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,3,
