Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's currently priced at $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that allows for some negotiation space. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still less than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Positive message:** It's important to start with a friendly and positive message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to:

* Gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.
*  Leave room for a counteroffer without immediately risking a rejection. 

I'm willing to drop the price further if necessary, but I'm not going to give it away!  I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to sell the product for such a drastic discount. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value. I'll need to find a balance between getting a reasonable price and ensuring he doesn't walk away completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is lower than what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This would give you a good deal, and still allow me to recover some of my costs.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  Offering $10,000 is a compromise. It's significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, but still lower than my previous offer.
* **Reframing the offer:** Highlighting that $10,000 would be a ""good deal"" for Bob can make it more appealing.
* **Reasoning:**  Explaining that this price would ""allow me to recover some of my costs"" is a subtle way of emphasizing that this is the lowest I'm willing to go.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* Show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give away the product.
*  Hopefully, this will lead to a final agreement closer to my desired value. 

I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a backup if this round of negotiation fails."
