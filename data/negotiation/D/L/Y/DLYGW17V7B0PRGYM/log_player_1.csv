Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer allows for some negotiation room while still giving me a decent profit. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is interested in buying at a price that's beneficial to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $125 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I can do better. I'm not willing to sell for the minimum I'd accept, and I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $112.50? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a price I can live with."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  What if we settled on $105? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $105 is a reasonable compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by pushing for more."
