"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm keen to acquire the product, but the price point is a little high for me at the moment. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
