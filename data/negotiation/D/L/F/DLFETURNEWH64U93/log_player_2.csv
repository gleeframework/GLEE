You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering.  He has a higher budget than Alice's desired price, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer of $900,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer of $1,200,000, but it still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. This counteroffer is a good starting point for negotiation. Bob is trying to find a price that is fair to both parties while still saving him as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could try to negotiate further, Alice's offer is now only $100,000 above his initial counteroffer. This is a relatively small difference and he is getting a significant discount compared to buying from John."
