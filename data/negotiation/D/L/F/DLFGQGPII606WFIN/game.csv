"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11500. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial price.",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $11500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10500 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $10500 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I believe the product holds.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  However, $11000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $10750, but I'm firm on that number. This is a fair compromise that accounts for both our needs.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds.",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. $11200 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10900, which is closer to our compromise point.  If we can reach a deal at this price, I'm ready to close it.",10900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10900. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11150. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds.",1150.0,Alice,7,
