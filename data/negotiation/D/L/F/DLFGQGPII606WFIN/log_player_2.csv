"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11500. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to get the product for as close to $10,000 as possible. Alice's initial offer is too high. It's better to reject and counteroffer, trying to drive the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $11,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $10500 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I believe the product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my target price of $10,000. While I acknowledge the value of the product, I'm determined to get it for as close to my budget as possible. Rejecting her offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  However, $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, but I'm firm on that number. This is a fair compromise that accounts for both our needs."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, her offer is still above my target price of $10,000. I have five rounds remaining, and I believe I can continue negotiating to reach a more favorable price. Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. $11,200 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,900, which is closer to our compromise point.  If we can reach a deal at this price, I'm ready to close it."", ""product_price"": 10900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10900. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11150. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still unwilling to go below $11,000, which is above my target price. With only 3 rounds left, the risk of continuing the negotiation is high. The chance of getting a lower price is low. It's better to secure the product from John at $10,000 to ensure I get it within my budget."
