"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000. This offer reflects a more accurate valuation while still recognizing your interest.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $750,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the gap between our valuations remains significant.  I'm willing to accept $850,000, which is a substantial compromise on my end. I believe this offer fairly reflects the value you'll gain from the product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $825,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your budget constraints, but accepting $825,000 would be significantly undervaluing the product for me.  I can come down to $840,000, which is my final offer. I believe this price represents a fair deal for both of us.",840000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a fair deal, but $840,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $820,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable price considering the value I'll get from it.",820000.0,Bob,8,
