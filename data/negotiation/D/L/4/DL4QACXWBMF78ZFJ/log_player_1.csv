Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is playing hardball and has now revealed he has an alternative option at his ideal price point.  He's unlikely to move significantly from his $1,000,000 offer.  It's not worth risking losing the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John in hopes of getting Bob slightly higher."
