"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this reflects its worth while acknowledging your potential return on investment. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $950,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $900,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and quickly recoup that investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your response, Alice. After careful consideration, I am still unable to meet the price of $900,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $875,000. This price aligns more closely with my budget while still recognizing the value of the product.",875000.0,Bob,4,
