Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some incentive to negotiate and potentially come closer to your desired price.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** You're leaving room for negotiation and potential counteroffers.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows that you're serious about selling but also willing to be flexible.

This approach balances your goal of earning as much as possible with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This reflects a significant discount from my original asking price, and it's a price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit shy of that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $9,500 is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000.  I've already made a significant concession, and I'm not sure Bob is willing to meet me halfway.  John is offering a guaranteed $15,000, so it's the most sensible choice for me at this point."
