Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,500 is still above my budget. I'm happy to go to $11,500. This is my final offer, as I can always go with John for $10,000.

Bob is bluffing, he won't get a better deal than $10,000 from John. It's not worth going any lower than $12,000."
