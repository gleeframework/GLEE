I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but still below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer, but if things don't work out with Bob, I have a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. I will counteroffer and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm reducing my price slightly, showing flexibility while still staying above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a little more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell for less than $1,500,000 unless I absolutely have to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm making a final counteroffer, slightly lower than my minimum but still higher than Bob's current offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while also leaving room for further negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum and I've already made several concessions. I'm not willing to go lower, and I don't want to risk further negotiation. It's time to secure a guaranteed sale with John."
