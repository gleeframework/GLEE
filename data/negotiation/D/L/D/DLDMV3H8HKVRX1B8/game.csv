"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in the product, but I need to be within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows you to make a significant return on your investment, while also giving me a fair return. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still not acceptable for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is my best price, and if you're unable to accept it, I will have to move on to another buyer.  Let me know your decision.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
