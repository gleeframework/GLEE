{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer allows for a good profit for me while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob wants a lower price. It's also a strategic starting point that avoids giving away too much of the value upfront."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to make this deal work.  This is still a great price considering the value the product offers you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"

# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?
