,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $150. Can we meet in the middle at $165?",165.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $165 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $170? It's a fantastic product, and I'm sure you'll find it's worth every penny.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is great, but I'm still not comfortable with $170. I'd be willing to meet you at $155. Can we discuss further?",155.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here. How about we split the difference and settle at $162.50? That's my final offer.",162.5,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $162.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $157.50. Can we discuss further?",157.5,Bob,6,
