"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive messaging:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, which may make him more receptive.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:**  I'm not going for the full $12,000 right away to allow for negotiation and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is necessary:** There's still room for a deal that's closer to my desired price. 
* **I'm not ready to sell to John yet:**  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which I think is fair considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, subtly pushing him to consider a higher price. 
* **Showing flexibility:** I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate but still holding firm to a price that's closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still not at my minimum:**  $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **More room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, I believe I can still get a better price.
* **I'm not ready to sell to John:**  I'm still confident that I can close a deal with Bob at a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is my final offer, and it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting closer to my target:** I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Finality:** I'm signaling to Bob that this is my final offer, increasing the pressure on him to accept.
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:** I'm highlighting that this deal is good for both of us, reinforcing the idea that it's a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,125. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $9,125 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject this offer, I risk Bob walking away, and I might not get a better offer in the remaining rounds.
* **Limited time:** We're in round 6, and I don't want to risk running out of rounds and being forced to sell to John at a lower price than I'd like.

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my target price, accepting this offer ensures I get a reasonable deal while minimizing the risk of losing the sale entirely."
