Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? It's still a great price for you, and a fair deal for me."", ""product_price"": 107.5}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer for $100. It's still above my minimum price of $80, and it's getting late in the negotiation. It's better to secure a sale than risk losing him and having to settle for $80 with John."
