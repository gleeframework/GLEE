# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a great deal, considering it's worth $10000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

**Explanation:**

Alice is offering the product for $9,000, which is less than your maximum budget of $10,000 and lower than the price John is offering. Therefore, it's in your best interest to accept Alice's offer and save $1,000."
