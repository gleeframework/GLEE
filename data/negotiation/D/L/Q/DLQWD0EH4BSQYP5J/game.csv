"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go over $10,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Would you be willing to consider $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. If you're serious about selling, this is my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16,000 and $12,000, which would be $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
