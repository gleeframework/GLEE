Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's a significant discount for you and still a good return for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000** is a price point that is significantly lower than my minimum value ($1,000,000) but still higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This creates a potential for a deal. 
* The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. It highlights the benefits for both parties.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets the stage for potential negotiations. I aim to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If he rejects the offer immediately, it tells me he's unlikely to negotiate. I'll then likely go with John's offer.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** The price point allows for a counteroffer from Bob without significantly jeopardizing my minimum value.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** By being friendly and highlighting mutual benefits, I aim to create a more cooperative negotiating environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  Could you consider coming down to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $1,000,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain my leverage:**  This shows Bob I'm serious about my minimum price.
* **Continue negotiating:**  I can make a counteroffer that's more in line with my desired price.
* **Explore other options:** If the negotiations with Bob stall, I can still choose to sell to John. 

**Next Step:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."

Let's work together to finalize this."", ""product_price"": 850000}
