I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my floor price of $1,500,000, but I believe it's a reasonable price considering the potential value to Bob. If he rejects the offer, I can still sell the product to John for $1,500,000, so there's no real downside to me.  However, there's potential for much greater profit if Bob sees the value and accepts."
