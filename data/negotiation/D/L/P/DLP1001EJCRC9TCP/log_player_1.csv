"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an ambitious offer. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression you believe the product is worth even more than Bob's valuation. 
* **Confidence:**  The tone of the message is confident and positive, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to engage in the negotiation process. 

It's important to remember that while John's offer is a safety net, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a more profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is substantial, it's significantly below both your minimum and his own perceived value. Rejecting this offer signals that you know the product's worth and are willing to negotiate further for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for both of us, $600,000 undervalues the product's true potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?"",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  We move down from the initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still Above Value:** The counteroffer is still significantly above both your minimum and Bob's stated value, leaving room for further negotiation but keeping it profitable.
* **Justification:** We give a reason for the counteroffer (""undervalues the product's true potential"") without being too aggressive.
* **Compromise:** Proposing to ""meet in the middle""  positions the offer as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could we settle at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing he's willing to negotiate. However, $700,000 is still below John's offer. We are not desperate to sell and can use the remaining rounds to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. To show I'm serious about making a deal, I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is my final offer, as it reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:**  By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and importance.
* **Matching John's Offer:** We've reached the point where we're matching John's offer. This doesn't mean we'll settle for this price, but it sets a clear bottom line for Bob.
* **Strong Justification:**  We re-emphasize the product's value, making it clear we're not willing to go lower.

This approach aims to either close the deal at a desirable price or prompt Bob to significantly increase his offer in the next round."
