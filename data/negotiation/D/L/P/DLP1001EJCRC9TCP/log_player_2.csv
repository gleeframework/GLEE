"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for both of us, $600,000 undervalues the product's true potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. To show I'm serious about making a deal, I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is my final offer, as it reflects the true value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is the best option for a few reasons:

* **Matching Prices:** Alice's offer now matches John's price. There's no financial benefit to buying from John at this point. 
* **""Final Offer"":** Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  Trying to push for a lower price might lead to her walking away.
* **Time:** While you have rounds remaining, securing the product now avoids potential delays or complications later in the negotiation."
