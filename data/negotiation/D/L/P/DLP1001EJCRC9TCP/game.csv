"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for both of us, $600,000 undervalues the product's true potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could we settle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. To show I'm serious about making a deal, I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is my final offer, as it reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
