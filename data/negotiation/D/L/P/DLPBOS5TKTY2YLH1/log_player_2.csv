Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 undervalues the product's true potential and the returns you'll see. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
