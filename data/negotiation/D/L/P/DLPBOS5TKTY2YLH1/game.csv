"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I recognize the value of this product, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it,  which reflects its potential while remaining within my financial constraints.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 undervalues the product's true potential and the returns you'll see. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering the potential of this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
