"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This is a no-brainer. Alice's offer is way above your budget and even above her own valuation of the product. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a much lower price.  Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Significant Difference:**  The $6,000 counteroffer creates a significant gap from both Alice's asking price and your walk-away price ($8,000 from John). This gives you both room to move towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Polite and Interested:** The message conveys that you are serious but also highlights your interest in the product, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down in price, $10,000 is still above your maximum budget and John's offer.  There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, $10,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere around $7,000? I'm eager to make a deal, but that price would make it much easier."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up, But Slowly:**  It's important to show Alice that you're willing to move from your initial low offer, but you shouldn't concede too much too quickly. A smaller counteroffer keeps the negotiation going.
* **Targeting Below the Midpoint:** Aiming slightly below the midpoint between her last offer ($10,000) and your previous offer ($6,000) keeps the pressure on Alice while signaling that you're willing to compromise. 
* **Expressing Eagerness and Budget Limits:**  Reiterating your interest while reinforcing your budget limitations encourages Alice to consider a price closer to your target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is the minimum price I need to make a profit. I'm confident that this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000.
