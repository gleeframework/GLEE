"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product to you, which holds significant value for you at $15,000. Considering its exceptional quality and benefits, I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $12,000. This is a special opportunity tailored to meet your needs and expectations. Should you be interested, please let me know, and we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can still do better. Since the product is only worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice or potentially find another seller with a better deal."
