"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $900,000. This represents a substantial investment for me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the unique advantages this product offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects its true worth while acknowledging your interest."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I recognize the value of this product, $1,300,000 is still above my comfortable price point.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This shows my commitment to acquiring the product, while still ensuring the deal is mutually beneficial. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still in the early stages of negotiation, and Bob is steadily increasing his offer. While $1,100,000 is a good profit, it's worth seeing if we can push for a higher price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about $1,225,000?  This reflects a compromise that acknowledges the product's true value while bringing us closer to a deal."", 
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm committed to making this deal work, but $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,150,000. I believe this offer fairly reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly committed to purchasing the product and is steadily increasing his offer.  $1,150,000 represents a strong profit above our minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks pushing him away. Accepting now secures a favorable deal."
