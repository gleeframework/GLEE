"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,200,000 is way above Bob's maximum budget, and he can get the product for $800,000 from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, but only if she's willing to come down significantly in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $1,200,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fantastic deal considering the product's value to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,050,000 is lower than her previous offer, it's still above Bob's target price of $800,000. Bob can still get the product from John for a lower price, and there's room for negotiation with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your desire to sell. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  However, $900,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's meet at $975,000.  This price is fair, considering your potential profit, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $975,000 is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still above his ideal price.  There's still a chance to negotiate with Alice, and Bob can always go with John if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $975,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $925,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and puts us closer to a deal. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $925,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product for you and the progress we've made. Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $950,000 is getting closer to his ideal price, it's still above his target of $800,000. Bob can still buy the product from John for a better price, and it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if they can reach a mutually agreeable price."
