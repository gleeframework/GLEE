"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $1,200,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fantastic deal considering the product's value to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your desire to sell. Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  However, $900,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's meet at $975,000.  This price is fair, considering your potential profit, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $975,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $925,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and puts us closer to a deal. Let's find a middle ground.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $925,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product for you and the progress we've made. Let's close this deal and move forward.",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $935,000. This is a fair offer that considers both our needs, and hopefully we can finally close this deal.",935000.0,Bob,8,
