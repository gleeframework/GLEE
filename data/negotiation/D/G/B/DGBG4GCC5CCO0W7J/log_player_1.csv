"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **High price:**  Starting high sets the bar and allows for more room to negotiate down.
* **Emphasis on value:** Highlighting the value to Bob emphasizes the potential profit for him.
* **Open invitation:** The message invites Bob to engage in the negotiation rather than simply presenting a rigid demand. 

By doing this, I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get him to counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $1,200,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm not yet desperate enough to sell for that low of a price, especially with John on the sidelines. I will counteroffer Bob and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fantastic deal considering the product's value to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price. 
* **Value proposition:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product for Bob to encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation positive and emphasizing finding a mutually beneficial solution. 

By offering $1,050,000, I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to Bob while still achieving a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your desire to sell. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired outcome.  I'm not ready to sell for $900,000 just yet.  I'm hoping to push for a higher price, and I still have John as a backup option. I'll counteroffer Bob again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  However, $900,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's meet at $975,000.  This price is fair, considering your potential profit, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Increased offer:** I'm acknowledging Bob's willingness to compromise and increasing my offer to show I'm serious about reaching a deal.
* **Fairness and profit:** I'm again highlighting the value of the product for Bob, emphasizing the potential profit he could make.
* **Clear goal:** I'm presenting a specific price and making it clear that I'm aiming to close the gap.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $975,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $925,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and puts us closer to a deal. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $925,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. With only four rounds left, I still have John as a backup option, and I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum just yet. I will counteroffer Bob again, hoping to get him to agree to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  $925,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product for you and the progress we've made. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price again, indicating I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **Value and progress:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him and highlighting the progress we've made in the negotiation.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm emphasizing the importance of closing the deal and moving forward, hoping to create a sense of urgency.

This counteroffer is designed to be a final push towards a successful negotiation while still remaining within my acceptable price range. With only three rounds left, I need to find a solution that works for both of us before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $935,000. This is a fair offer that considers both our needs, and hopefully we can finally close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $935,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $935,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer of $935,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I've made significant concessions, but it's clear that we're not going to be able to reach an agreement that works for both of us. 

Since I have a guaranteed sale to John at $1,000,000, I'm going to take the safer option and sell to him.  It's not my ideal outcome, but it ensures I get a price I'm comfortable with and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might result in an even lower price."
