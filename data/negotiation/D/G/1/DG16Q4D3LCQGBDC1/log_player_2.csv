"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your budget and what you know John will sell the product for.  It's time to start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $650,000?"",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from a starting offer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and helps gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a polite and professional tone is key to successful negotiations, even while making a low initial offer. 
* **Signaling Interest:** The message clarifies that you are interested in the product but need a more agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, the price is still $100,000 more than your backup option with John. There's room to negotiate further and see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  I'm getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you do $725,000? That would make a big difference for me."",
""product_price"": 725000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  Instead of another large jump, this offer increases incrementally, showing willingness to move towards Alice's price but also indicating that there's still a gap.
* **Emphasis on Budget:** Reiterating budget limitations strengthens your position and reinforces the need for a price reduction.
* **Seeking Common Ground:** The message aims to find a middle ground that works for both parties while still leaving room for potential further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has drawn a line in the sand at $850,000.  While this is below her initial offer and closer to your budget, it's still more expensive than your guaranteed option with John.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation if you're unwilling to pay more than John's price."
