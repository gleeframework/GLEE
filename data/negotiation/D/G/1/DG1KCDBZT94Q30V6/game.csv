"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me for this product.  However, $20,000 is a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $17,000, which is still a great deal for you. What do you think?",17000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $17,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $18,500?",18500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  $18,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $17,750? It's a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy. ",17750.0,Bob,4,

"You drive a hard bargain, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle on $18,125?  That's my final offer.",18125.0,Alice,5,
