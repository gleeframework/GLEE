"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. $20,000 is more than his budget, so he should reject Alice's initial offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me for this product.  However, $20,000 is a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $17,000, which is still a great deal for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $17,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $18,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to save money. While $18,500 is closer to his budget, he can likely get it for even less with continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  $18,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $17,750? It's a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy. "", ""product_price"": 17750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle on $18,125?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is determined to get the best price possible. While $18,125 is getting close to his limit, he's still not at his ideal price. He'll try one more counteroffer to see if he can get Alice to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm happy to go to $17,900, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 17900}
