Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how Alice might approach this and the offer she could make:

**Alice's Reasoning**

* **Minimum Acceptable Price:** Alice's absolute floor is $1,000,000 because she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This means there's potentially a $200,000 surplus Alice could capture.
* **Negotiating Power:** Alice is in a strong position. She has a fallback option, giving her leverage to aim high.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers you."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message Tone:** The message is confident and positions the product based on its value, not just the price.
* **Price Strategy:**  Alice aims high within the potential surplus. This leaves room for negotiation (if Bob counter-offers) but still secures a significant gain above her minimum.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $1,150,000. He might counter-offer, or Alice might need to adjust her price if she wants to avoid going to John. This strategy simply maximizes her potential gain in the initial offer."
