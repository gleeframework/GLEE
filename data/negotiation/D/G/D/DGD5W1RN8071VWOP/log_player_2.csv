Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $122.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product.

You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $120, and it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. It's better to secure the product from John at the known price."
