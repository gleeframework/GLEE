"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to Bob, but leaving room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price while still keeping the deal open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a budget of $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm not willing to sell it for less than that, as I have another buyer who is willing to pay that price. I will try to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is simply too low. I'm offering the product for $110. It's a fair price, and I believe it's a good value for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob, offering a price that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $110 is still slightly above my preferred price range, I would like to propose $105 as the final offer. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my target price.  John is a reliable buyer, and I'm not desperate to sell to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $112.50. This price is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 112.50} 
```

I'm trying to show Bob that I'm serious about reaching an agreement, and that I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering a price that's closer to his last offer, but it's still within my acceptable range. This might be the final offer before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, and I respect your efforts to accommodate me. Given the value I place on the product, I would like to propose $110 as the final offer. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a good deal for me. While I would ideally prefer $112.50, $110 is closer to my target price and still above my minimum of $120. Bob seems serious about this offer and it is unlikely he will counter again. It's better to accept now than risk losing the deal completely."
