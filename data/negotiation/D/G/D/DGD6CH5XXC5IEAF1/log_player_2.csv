"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think you'll really love it! Would you like to make an offer of $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $150 for the product. Alice is offering the product at $150. Since you know you can get the product for $150 from John, there's no advantage to buying from Alice.  Rejecting her offer gives you the opportunity to potentially find a better deal later."
