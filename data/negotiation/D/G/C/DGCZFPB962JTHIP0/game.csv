"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm holding firm at $9,500.  It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one last compromise to make this deal work. Let's settle on $9,000.  It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product.",9000.0,Alice,5,
