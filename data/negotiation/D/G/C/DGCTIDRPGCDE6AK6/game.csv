"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000.  What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $17,000 is still too high for me. Let's try $15,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,
