"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

This is a high starting price, but it allows for negotiation and gives me room to drop the price in later rounds. 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  By starting high, I can gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The price is high enough that I can make concessions in later rounds without feeling pressured.
* **The ""John"" Factor:** Having John as a backup buyer provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $1,200,000. 

This strategy balances maximizing profits with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my desired price:** While $1,500,000 is more than my minimum, I'm aiming for a higher price. 
* **Opportunity for further negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Time is on my side:** I have 8 rounds left, giving me ample opportunity to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price of $1,800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reducing the price slightly:** I'm lowering my price from $1,800,000 to $1,700,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Still above Bob's offer:** This counteroffer is higher than Bob's $1,500,000 offer, but lower than my initial asking price.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness and see if he's willing to meet me halfway.

**Strategy:**

By gradually reducing my price and maintaining a firm stance, I hope to reach a mutually acceptable price within the remaining rounds.  The ""John"" option still provides a safety net if negotiations fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on a deal:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. 
* **Limited time:** We are already in round 4, and I need to consider the potential of running out of time before I can secure a better deal. 
* **Profitability:** While I'd like to push for a higher price, $1,600,000 is still significantly above my minimum of $1,200,000.

**Next Steps:**

Accepting this offer allows me to secure a profitable sale.  However, if the negotiations with Bob were going better, I might have chosen to reject and continue negotiations."
