"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was hoping to negotiate a better price. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value you mentioned earlier.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your position, but  $1,200,000 is  a significant undervaluation of this product's potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $1,350,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
