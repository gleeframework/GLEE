{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $130, knowing it's higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly tone and highlighting the product's benefits to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion, showing that I'm open to discussion and potentially adjusting the price.

**Strategy:**

This approach allows me to:

* **Maximize profit:**  Aiming high initially gives me the best chance of getting closer to my desired price.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** Bob's response will reveal his level of interest and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain flexibility:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his counteroffer or move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $90? I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is limited. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $90 is tempting, it's significantly lower than my desired minimum of $150. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Negotiate further:** I can counter with a price closer to my desired value, potentially securing a higher price.
* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to walk away.
* **Evaluate options:**  This rejection also gives me more time to consider John's offer of $150, providing a clear benchmark for my negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget is limited, but $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? That's still a great deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Empathy:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints while emphasizing the value of the product and the fairness of my counteroffer.
* **Positive framing:**  I use language like ""great deal"" and ""work together"" to create a positive and cooperative atmosphere.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain control:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving in a direction that benefits me without immediately resorting to John's offer.
* **Test Bob's willingness:**  Bob's reaction to this compromise will reveal his seriousness about purchasing the product and his potential for further negotiation.
* **Set a realistic expectation:**  $110 is a compromise, but it's still closer to my desired price point and potentially acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high.  Would you consider $100? I'm really serious about buying this product and think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is closer to my minimum price of $150, it's still significantly lower than I'd like to get.  Accepting would mean losing a considerable amount of potential profit.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  I can counter with a higher price, potentially securing a better deal.
* **Test Bob's limits:**  His counteroffer reveals his willingness to pay more, allowing me to gauge how much I can push.
* **Maximize potential:**  By rejecting, I keep the option of selling to John for $150 open, ensuring that I don't settle for a suboptimal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your enthusiasm and willingness to negotiate.  While $100 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $105. It's a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe we can finalize this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:**  I'm offering a slightly higher price than Bob's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet him halfway, but still staying within my acceptable range.
* **Positive tone:**  I use positive language like ""fair compromise"" and ""finalise this deal"" to create a sense of optimism and encourage agreement.
* **Strategic phrasing:**  ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and continue the dialogue, potentially leading to a final agreement.

**Strategy:**

* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's maximum willingness to pay while staying above my minimum price.
* **Minimizing risk:**  By staying close to $100, I minimize the risk of Bob walking away, but still maintain a reasonable profit margin.
* **Preparing for the final decision:**  Depending on Bob's response, I can either accept his offer, make a final counteroffer, or choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm really determined to get this product and I'm willing to pay $95. This is my final offer, so I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I've been able to negotiate closer to that price, it's clear that Bob won't budge further. 

**Strategy:**

Selling to John for $150 is the best option:

* **Guaranteed profit:**  This ensures I receive my minimum desired profit and avoid a loss.
* **Time efficiency:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would be time-consuming and may not result in a better outcome.
* **Avoiding disappointment:**  It's better to accept John's offer than to risk losing out on a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
