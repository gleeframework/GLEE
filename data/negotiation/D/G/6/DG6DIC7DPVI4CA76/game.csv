"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $90? I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is limited.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget is limited, but $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? That's still a great deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high.  Would you consider $100? I'm really serious about buying this product and think this price is fair for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your enthusiasm and willingness to negotiate.  While $100 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $105. It's a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe we can finalize this deal.  What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm really determined to get this product and I'm willing to pay $95. This is my final offer, so I hope we can reach an agreement.",95.0,Bob,6,
