"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget is limited, but $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? That's still a great deal for you and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.

While $110 is closer to your budget, it's still above your $80 limit. You should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate further."
