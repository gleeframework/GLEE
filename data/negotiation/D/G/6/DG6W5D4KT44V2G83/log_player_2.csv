"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer right away.  You have no information about her minimum price, and you might be able to get it for less. Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000} 
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price is a good strategy. It shows Alice you're serious about negotiating and forces her to reveal how much she's willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While $750,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting and counteroffering keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has moved closer to your initial counteroffer, so it's time to raise yours slightly.  A counteroffer of $700,000 is a reasonable compromise, showing a willingness to meet halfway while still keeping the pressure on Alice to drop her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** We're getting close to a good price, but there's still room to bargain. It's worth trying to see if Alice will come down further.  If she rejects this counteroffer, we'll likely be at a point where accepting her offer is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 710000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and this counteroffer is a small increase, indicating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a slightly better price. If she rejects this, we'll be very close to accepting her next offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  We've reached a point where Alice is likely close to her minimum acceptable price.  Rejecting and counteroffering again risks the possibility that she'll walk away, leaving us with having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer at $720,000 secures the product and saves us $80,000 compared to buying from John."
