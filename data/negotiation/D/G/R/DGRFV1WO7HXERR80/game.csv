"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price?",90.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a living. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least a little profit. How about $105?",105.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we split the difference and meet at $100? That seems fair to me.",100.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,110.0
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I've already come down to $105 and you're asking me to go back to $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about $107.50?",107.5,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable, but $107.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $102, which is more than your original asking price.  What do you say?",102.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,108.0
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $102, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we meet in the middle again at $102.50?",102.5,Alice,7,,
