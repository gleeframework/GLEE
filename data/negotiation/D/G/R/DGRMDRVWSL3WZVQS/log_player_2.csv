"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Let me know if that sounds good to you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely do better.  Since the product is only worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, that's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $12,000, demonstrating Bob's serious intent to negotiate.
* **Room for Compromise:**  $9,500 is still a good deal for Alice, as she values the product at $8,000. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This offer gives Alice an opportunity to counter, keeping the negotiation going and potentially finding a price that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** $11,000 is a good compromise between Bob's previous counteroffer and Alice's initial offer. It's significantly better than John's price of $15,000. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might become unwilling to sell at all. Accepting the offer secures the product at a favorable price.
* **Value for Both Parties:** $11,000 is still a profitable sale for Alice, and Bob gets the product for a price that is well within his budget."
