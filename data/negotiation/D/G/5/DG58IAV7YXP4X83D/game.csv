"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I value our negotiation and I'm willing to go a bit lower, but $85 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference at $92.50?  That's a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Alice,5,
