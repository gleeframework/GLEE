{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so this offer leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This offer is below your minimum of $15,000, giving you room to lower the price if necessary.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's not too aggressive, making it more likely that Bob will engage in the negotiation. 

Remember,  I can always accept John's offer of $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **Reject Bob's offer**.  

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price. 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a price that's more favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $11,000. This reflects the product's true value and gives you a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

Here's why I'm offering $11,000:

* **It's a compromise:** This offer is a compromise between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000.
* **It's closer to my target:** This offer is still below my minimum of $15,000 but closer to my desired price.
* **It's a good value for Bob:** The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, so this offer is still a good deal for him.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob, but I'm still prepared to walk away if necessary and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer**. While it's a slight improvement from his previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm determined to get closer to my target price, and I believe there's still room for negotiation.

I'll make a final counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price that's closer to my desired range. If Bob continues to reject my offers, I'll be happy to sell the product to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value. This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to move on.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

Here's why I'm offering $10,500:

* **Final offer:** This is my final attempt to reach a deal with Bob. I'm making a significant concession to try to close the deal.
* **Still above my minimum:** While this is below my ideal price, it's still above my minimum of $15,000.
* **Fair compromise:** This offer is a good compromise between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500.

I'm hoping this offer will be acceptable to Bob. If not, I'll move on and sell to John, as I've already reached my limit in terms of price reduction."
