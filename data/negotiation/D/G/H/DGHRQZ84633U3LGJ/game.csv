"I'm interested in the product, but I think your price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is around $1500000",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $900000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly lower than the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000 to facilitate a deal.  This price reflects the significant benefits this product will provide to your business, and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work together to find a solution that meets our needs.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
