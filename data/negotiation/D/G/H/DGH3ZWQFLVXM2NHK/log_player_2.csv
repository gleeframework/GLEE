# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $1,000,000.  

By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or, as a worst-case scenario, buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is still within his budget."
