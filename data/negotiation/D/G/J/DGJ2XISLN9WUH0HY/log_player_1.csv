I'm starting with a price of $14,500. This is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm also considering the potential sale to John for $15,000, but I'd prefer to sell to Bob if I can get a price closer to my own valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I can still try to get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is a slight concession from my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer.  I'm trying to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm concerned that we're getting bogged down in negotiations. I'd rather sell to John for $15,000 and guarantee myself a higher profit."
