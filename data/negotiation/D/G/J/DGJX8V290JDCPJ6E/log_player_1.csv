"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but still potentially attractive to Bob. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this will be a price he's willing to accept."
