"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, aiming for a good profit margin.  I'm confident the product is worth this to Bob, and it leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for less than what I consider a fair price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000} 
```

I'm dropping the price a bit, but still maintaining a profit margin. This shows flexibility while demonstrating I'm serious about selling to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, it's important to remember that I have limited rounds. This deal ensures a good profit, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
