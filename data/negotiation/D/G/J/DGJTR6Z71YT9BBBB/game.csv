"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm hoping we can find a compromise here.  What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there with $1250000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1300000? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to move forward.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, let's try to close this deal.  I'm willing to go down to $1290000.  This is a very fair price, and I don't think we can get much closer.  What do you say?",1290000.0,Alice,7,
