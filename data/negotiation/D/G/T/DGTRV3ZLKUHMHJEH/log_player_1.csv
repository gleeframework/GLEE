Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above the product's value to me, hoping to get a good deal. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your product is valuable, but I believe I can offer you $120 for it. This aligns better with my budget. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's better to secure the sale than risk further negotiation and potential rejection."
