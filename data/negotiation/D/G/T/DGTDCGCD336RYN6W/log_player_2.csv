"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price, especially since you have an alternative option (buying from John)."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $13,000. It's a fair compromise that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget of $10,000. I can still try to negotiate a lower price, as I'm willing to pay $11,000, and I have the option to buy from John for $10,000.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to pay $11,500, which is a fair compromise considering our previous offers. Let's see if we can seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,500 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still above my budget of $10,000. While I could continue to negotiate, it's getting close to my maximum price, and there's no guarantee she'll go lower.  Since I have the option to buy from John for $10,000, it's the most financially responsible decision to go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
