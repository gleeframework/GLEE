Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $85, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm getting a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, and I'd like to try to get closer to my target price.

It's becoming clear that Alice is not going to budge much from her desired price.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a price that's acceptable for you.  Buying from John for $80 ensures you stay within your budget."
