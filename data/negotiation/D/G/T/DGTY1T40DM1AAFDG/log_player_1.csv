Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that is slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 12,000}

I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $9,000. Since the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, I'm not interested in selling it to Bob at this price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll send Bob a new offer that's higher than his counteroffer but still lower than my minimum price. Let's try to get closer to the product's true value:

{""product_price"": 11,000}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I've sent a counteroffer to Bob. Here it is:

{""product_price"": 11,000}

I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further."
