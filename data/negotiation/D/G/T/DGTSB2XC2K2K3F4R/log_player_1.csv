Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it! I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport with Bob and make him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm asking Bob what he thinks to encourage a response and begin the negotiation process."
