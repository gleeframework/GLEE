"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly sought after.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting high, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my absolute minimum, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'll aim to counter in a way that keeps him engaged while pushing for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your perspective on the price, but I believe the product's unique features and potential warrant a higher investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By coming down from my initial price, I demonstrate a willingness to negotiate, which can help keep Bob engaged. 
* **Aim Higher:**  While I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm still aiming for a price significantly higher than his initial proposal. 
* **Highlight Value:** I'm reiterating the ""unique features and potential"" of the product to reinforce its value in Bob's mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I think we can find a better compromise. How about $1,250,000? I believe this is a fair price for the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing he's serious. However, the increase is still small. I'll hold firm and counter, aiming to get him closer to $1,300,000.  I'm willing to let go of some potential profit to secure a deal with Bob, as long as it's above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle on $1,350,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference (Almost):**  I'm coming down significantly from my previous offer, signaling that I'm getting closer to my bottom line. However, I'm not quite meeting him directly in the middle, leaving room for a final concession if needed.
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:**  By framing the price as a ""solution that works for both of us,"" I'm aiming to create a collaborative tone and make the offer more appealing. 
* **Reinforce Value:** While acknowledging Bob's negotiation, I'm still subtly reminding him of the product's value to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $1,325,000? I believe this is a fair price for the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is a significant profit above my minimum of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  After 6 rounds, it's likely that further negotiation will yield minimal gains. Continuing might risk Bob walking away.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now allows me to use the funds for other opportunities instead of potentially dragging out the negotiation. 

While I could push for slightly more, the risk of losing the deal and ending up with John's offer ($1,200,000) is not worth the potential but uncertain reward."
