Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for you."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price, even though Bob may not perceive it as such a high value yet. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer is a strategic move to gather information about Bob's willingness to pay and set the stage for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my minimum acceptable price and my initial offer. While his message mentions a ""tight budget,"" this could be a negotiation tactic.  It's worth seeing if I can negotiate a better deal before accepting such a low price or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I can offer it for $1,400,000. This price reflects a considerable compromise on my end while acknowledging the product's potential benefits for you."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Above Minimum:**  I've lowered my price by $200,000, showing flexibility but remaining well above my $1,200,000 minimum and John's offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, hoping to shift his perception and justify the higher price.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that's more appealing to Bob while still securing a profitable deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer slightly, but it's still significantly below my minimum and John's standing offer.  Bob's repeated mention of his budget makes me think he might not be willing to go much higher. I'll make one more counteroffer closer to my minimum, but if he doesn't budge significantly, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,200,000.  This is the lowest price I can accept considering the product's value and my other options. I believe it's a fair offer, and I hope we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my best and final offer.
* **Matching John's Offer:** I'm setting my price equal to John's offer, signaling that I'm willing to walk away from the negotiation with Bob if he doesn't accept. 
* **Direct and Firm:** The message is straightforward, emphasizing the fairness of the offer and my alternative option (selling to John)."
