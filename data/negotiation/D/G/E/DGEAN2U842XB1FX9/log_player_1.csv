"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiation theory suggests starting with an ambitious but not outrageous offer. This anchors the negotiation at a higher point. 
* **Justification:** I've included a reason for the high price, emphasizing the product's ""value and potential"". This frames the offer as less about taking advantage and more about the inherent worth of what's being sold. 
* **Room to Negotiate:** This initial price leaves significant room for negotiation, allowing me to potentially meet Bob somewhere in the middle while still surpassing my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Alternative:** By keeping John's offer in mind, I have a strong alternative if Bob doesn't offer a reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,300,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have my limits. How about we bring the price down significantly, to something closer to $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. It's clear there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter in hopes of reaching a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential impact.  To be fair, I'm willing to move closer to your range. Let's consider $1,900,000. This reflects the true value while recognizing your interest."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** I've made a substantial decrease from my initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, the new price is still significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm continuing to highlight the product's value, aiming to reframe the discussion from just a price point to the inherent worth Bob would receive. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer helps me gauge Bob's flexibility. If he's unwilling to move substantially from $800,000, I may consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit closer to my range, but $1,900,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  To be realistic, the price needs to be considerably lower.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has increased significantly, and it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. However, $1,100,000 is still below my target, and I believe there's room for him to go higher. I'm willing to counteroffer again but will carefully consider John's offer if Bob doesn't show substantial movement in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I appreciate you moving towards a more realistic price point. While $1,100,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a figure that reflects the true value of this product.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,500,000?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer positions the compromise as a ""meet in the middle"" scenario, which can be psychologically appealing in negotiations. 
* **Firm but Fair:** By stating my desired price outright, I'm signaling firmness while still leaving room for a final counteroffer from Bob if he's absolutely unwilling to go that high.
* **John as Leverage:** While I haven't explicitly mentioned John, having his offer in my back pocket gives me strength in this negotiation. I'm willing to walk away if Bob won't agree to a price close to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I see the value in the product, $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle right between our last two offers at $1,300,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:**  $1,300,000 is a solid offer. It's above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000 and a good return on the product.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Negotiations can be tiring. Accepting this offer avoids further back and forth and the potential for the deal to fall through.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While I could push for more, there's always the risk Bob will walk away. Accepting now guarantees a good profit and lets me move on. 

While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more, Bob's offer is strong, and the certainty of this deal outweighs the potential upside of continuing to negotiate."
