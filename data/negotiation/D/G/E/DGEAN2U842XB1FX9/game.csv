"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,300,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have my limits. How about we bring the price down significantly, to something closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential impact.  To be fair, I'm willing to move closer to your range. Let's consider $1,900,000. This reflects the true value while recognizing your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit closer to my range, but $1,900,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  To be realistic, the price needs to be considerably lower.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I appreciate you moving towards a more realistic price point. While $1,100,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a figure that reflects the true value of this product.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I see the value in the product, $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we settle right between our last two offers at $1,300,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
