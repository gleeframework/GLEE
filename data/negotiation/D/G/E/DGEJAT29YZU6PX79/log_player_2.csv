"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's worth $100 to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable item at a fair price. Let's discuss how we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price seems a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $70 for it."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay much less than Alice's asking price. Starting with a counteroffer of $70 gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $100 limit.
* **Gauging Alice's Position:** This counteroffer will help us understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price. Her response will give us a better idea of a realistic target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to propose a price of $85 for the product. This still reflects its value while allowing us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** Alice came down slightly from her initial offer, but $85 is still significantly higher than our target price and her product's value to her ($80). 
* **Leverage Remaining:** We have plenty of rounds left, and Alice seems willing to negotiate. Rejecting this offer encourages her to move closer to a price we find acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This approach often feels fair to both parties in a negotiation. It shows we're willing to compromise while still aiming for a price well below Alice's initial offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $75 puts us in a good spot. It's closer to our ideal price and leaves room for Alice to potentially counter with something around $80 (her value for the product)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. To find a mutually beneficial solution, I propose a price of $82 for the product. This respects its value while making the deal more attractive for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:**  Alice is moving slowly towards a price we find agreeable. While $82 is closer, it's still above her value and leaves little room for us to get a great deal.
* **Applying Pressure:**  By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about a lower price and willing to walk away if necessary. This might encourage Alice to make a more significant concession in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this, but $82 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to pay $78 if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're moving up slightly from our previous offer of $75, showing Alice that we're willing to compromise but not by much.
* **Staying Below Value:** $78 keeps us comfortably below Alice's $80 value for the product, maximizing our potential savings.
* **Time Consideration:**  With fewer rounds remaining, we're applying gentle pressure by nudging the price closer to our target while leaving room for one final counteroffer from Alice, if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Bob. Considering your latest offer, I am willing to sell the product for $79. This price respects the value of the product while making it a reasonable deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice has come down to $79, which is a great price and only $1 above her value. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we might be able to squeeze out another dollar in further rounds, the difference is negligible, and we risk Alice becoming frustrated and ending the negotiation.
* **Securing the Deal:** Accepting this offer guarantees we get the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer and saves us from potentially having to settle for a less favorable outcome in later rounds."
