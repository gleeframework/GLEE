{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer sets the price at $1,000,000. Here's why:

* **It's a good compromise:** It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still less than the full value of $1,200,000 for Bob. 
* **It maximizes potential gain:**  There's a good chance Bob will accept, as he still gets a significant value out of the deal. If he rejects, you're still guaranteed the $800,000 from John.

Let me know if you'd like me to adjust the offer price based on Bob's response!"
