Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the product's value, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we settle on $1,000,000?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you consider $1,100,000? I believe that's a fair offer that acknowledges the value while working for me.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum price, $1,100,000 is still a bit too low. I'm confident I can get a better price by counter-offering in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle.  I'm getting closer to my budget, but $1,150,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle on $1,120,000?  That's a significant move on my part, and I'm hopeful we can close this out.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,120,000 is getting very close to my minimum price, I'm only two rounds away from selling to John for $1,200,000. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to agree to a price closer to my desired range."
