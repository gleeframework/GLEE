"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I've carefully considered its value and believe a price of $1,400,000 would be fair for both of us. It's a great opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly beneficial. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the product's value, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we settle on $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, reflecting the significant value this product brings. It's a reasonable compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you consider $1,100,000? I believe that's a fair offer that acknowledges the value while working for me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is getting closer, I need to be closer to my minimum asking price. Let's split the difference - $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will bring you significant value.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle.  I'm getting closer to my budget, but $1,150,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle on $1,120,000?  That's a significant move on my part, and I'm hopeful we can close this out.",1120000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,120,000 is a great offer, but I'm just a little shy of my target price. To close this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,130,000.  That's a small difference, and I truly believe this product will be a game-changer for you.  Let's make this happen!",1130000.0,Alice,7,
