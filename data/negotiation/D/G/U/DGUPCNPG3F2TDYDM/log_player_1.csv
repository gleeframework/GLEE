Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and this offer reflects its true value."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $15,000. By offering it slightly below this at $14,500, I maximize my chances of securing the highest possible profit.
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $10,000, ensuring I don't make a loss.
* **Negotiation Room:** While the offer is close to Bob's valuation, it leaves a small margin for potential negotiation if he tries to haggle."
