Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $925000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to reaching a deal. I'm confident this is a fair price that works for both of us.

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a price closer to my minimum value of $1,200,000.
