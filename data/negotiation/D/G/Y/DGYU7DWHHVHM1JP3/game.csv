"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way outside my budget. This product would be valuable to me at a much lower price point. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I could come down to $18,000.  This is my best offer and reflects the true worth of this product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. To be realistic, I could go as high as $9,500.  This is a fair offer, considering I have other options available.",9500.0,Bob,4,
