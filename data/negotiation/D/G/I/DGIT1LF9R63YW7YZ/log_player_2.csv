"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly lower than its worth to you.  I believe this is a win-win situation, and I'm confident this product will be highly beneficial to your business. Let me know if you're interested, or we can discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to purchase the product for a lower price from John."
