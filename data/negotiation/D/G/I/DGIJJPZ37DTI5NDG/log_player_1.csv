Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds for you."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your alternatives:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000. This forms your ""walk-away"" point â€“ you should never accept less from Bob.
* **Aiming high, but realistically:** Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it at that price or slightly above would likely be rejected outright.  Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin above your guaranteed price. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" aims to frame the price as justified rather than arbitrary.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Your goal is to maximize your profit, but be aware that being too inflexible might lead to Bob walking away."
