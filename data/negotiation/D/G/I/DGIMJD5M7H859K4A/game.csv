"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $9500 is simply too low for me.  How about $9800? It's a fair price that's still a great value for you. What do you say?",9800.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $9600 as a counteroffer. This price is reasonable for both of us.",9600.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $9600 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9700?  I'm confident this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",9700.0,Alice,5,
