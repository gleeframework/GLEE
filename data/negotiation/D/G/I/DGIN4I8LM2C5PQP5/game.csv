"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a tempting price, but I'm hoping we can find a number that works for both of us. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. Would you be open to $12000? ",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15000 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $13500. This is still a great deal, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While $13500 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit lower. How about $13000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to comfortably purchase the product.",13000.0,Bob,4,
