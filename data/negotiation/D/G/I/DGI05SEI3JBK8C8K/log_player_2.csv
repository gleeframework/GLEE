Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is a good price for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think $85 is the minimum I can accept. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?

It's time to cut our losses.  Alice is unlikely to go below $85, and we have a guaranteed option at $80 with John."
