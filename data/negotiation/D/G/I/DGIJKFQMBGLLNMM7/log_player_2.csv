"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $900,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for much less than $900,000 (your maximum is $1,500,000) and Alice likely wants to sell it for more than $800,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $750,000.  This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident it's a price that would still be profitable for you."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit while giving you a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is still significantly lower than your maximum of $1,500,000. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and you'd be forced to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price."
