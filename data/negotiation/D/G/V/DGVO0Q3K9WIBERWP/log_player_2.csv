"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is within your budget, you can try to get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her $100 valuation. If she doesn't budge, you can always fall back on buying from John for $150."
