"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,300,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $950,000 is a significant drop. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,100,000? This price reflects the product's true value while still offering you a competitive advantage.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate the compromise, I must respectfully decline at $1,100,000. My budget allows me to consider a maximum of $950,000. I am open to further discussion if there's any room for negotiation within that range.",950000.0,Bob,4,
