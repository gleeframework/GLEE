"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $165. Let me know if that's more to your liking!",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $165 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $155?",155.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can offer it to you for $160. Let's see if we can meet in the middle!",160.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make another concession. However, $160 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $155?",155.0,Bob,6,

"I've already offered you $160, and you're coming back with the same offer as before. I'm not willing to go back and forth like this. I'm willing to meet you at $158, but that's as low as I can go. Let's finalize the deal!",158.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're not willing to go back and forth, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $155 and $158, which would be $156.50. Would you be willing to consider that?",156.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not going to go back and forth forever, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $157.50, but that's as close to $158 as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to consider other options.",157.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're not willing to go any lower, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $156.50, which is the best I can do. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $120.",156.5,Bob,10,
