Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet halfway at $850,000? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a competitive price."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. However, $850,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? That's a fair compromise, I believe. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:** Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll reach our minimum price within a reasonable number of rounds. Accepting John's offer of $800,000 guarantees us our minimum acceptable profit."
