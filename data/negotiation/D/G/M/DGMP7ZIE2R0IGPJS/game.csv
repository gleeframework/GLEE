"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet halfway at $850,000? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a competitive price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. However, $850,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? That's a fair compromise, I believe.",700000.0,Bob,4,
