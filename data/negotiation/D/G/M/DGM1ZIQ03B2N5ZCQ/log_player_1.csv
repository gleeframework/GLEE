Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but the price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price closer to its market value.  I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,500,000 mark I need.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed offer from John."
