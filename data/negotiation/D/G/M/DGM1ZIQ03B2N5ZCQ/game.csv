"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm confident it will greatly benefit you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  Let me know your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but the price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price closer to its market value.  I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $800,000 is quite a bit below its true value, I'm willing to find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,900,000? This reflects a significant reduction on my part while acknowledging the product's worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a fair price.  While $1,350,000 is closer to what I have in mind, it's still a significant gap from my initial asking price. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a substantial concession and a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I understand this is a valuable product, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget.  I can go up to $1,450,000. This demonstrates my commitment to making this deal happen.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
