"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, however.  How about $9,500? This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $9,500. How about $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about meeting in the middle, but $8,750 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to go down to $9,250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth it. What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but no higher. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,6,
