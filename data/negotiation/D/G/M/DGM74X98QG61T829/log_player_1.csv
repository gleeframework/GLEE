Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,500** is a starting point that leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for me. 
*  I've included a friendly message to start the conversation and emphasize the value proposition for Bob. 

This approach aims to:

*  Get a negotiation started with a reasonable offer.
*  Leave space for Bob to counter, allowing for potential higher gains. 
*  Provide a clear price to avoid ambiguity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can get closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, but it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to push the price closer to $11,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,800 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $11,200 for this valuable product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11200}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $11,200:** This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my desired profit margin.
* **Emphasize value:** Reminding Bob of the product's value and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal increases the chances of acceptance.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone throughout the negotiation can lead to a more successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can get to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is only $500 less than my initial offer and significantly more than John's offer of $10,000.  It's a good compromise and worth accepting to secure a sale and avoid further negotiation."
