(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, and $1,200,000 is significantly more than his $800,000 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer close to his maximum budget. This shows Alice he's serious about buying but also signals that he won't go much higher.  He's hoping Alice will be motivated to accept a deal that's still profitable for her, while still saving him a significant amount of money."

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Reasoning:**

However, he is still aiming to stay below his maximum budget while getting the best price possible. This is a strategic move to test if Alice is willing to accept a deal closer to Bob's desired price."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 990000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is raising his offer again, demonstrating his willingness to close the deal. However, he's still staying below his maximum budget and just slightly above his initial counteroffer of $950,000. This shows Alice he's willing to compromise but won't overpay. This is a final attempt to reach a mutually agreeable price. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will buy the product from John to avoid further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer, while lower than previous rounds, is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. At this point, it's clear that further negotiation might not result in a significantly lower price from Alice.  Bob has already made multiple counteroffers and demonstrated his willingness to compromise.  Rather than continuing a potentially drawn-out negotiation that might not yield a better outcome,  Bob decides to secure the product from John for his target price of $800,000,  avoiding further risk and ensuring the most cost-effective solution."
