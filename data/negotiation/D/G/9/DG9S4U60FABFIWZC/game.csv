"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,500. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to $10,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
