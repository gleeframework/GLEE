{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only three rounds remaining, Bob should accept Alice's offer. The price is a little higher than his last counteroffer, but it's still a significant savings compared to buying from John.  He's made good progress in the negotiation and there's a risk that if he rejects this offer, Alice may become less flexible or even walk away from the deal. Accepting this offer secures the purchase at a good price with limited risk of losing out."
