"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $12,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your target price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $13,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though. I'll sell the product to you for $12,800. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",12800.0,Alice,5,
