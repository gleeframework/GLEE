Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your target price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $13,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though. I'll sell the product to you for $12,800. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800

It seems like Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $12,800.  At this point, further haggling might not yield significant savings. It's more efficient to buy from John for $15,000 and avoid potentially protracted negotiations."
