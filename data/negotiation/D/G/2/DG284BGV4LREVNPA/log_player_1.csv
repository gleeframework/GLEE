Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I already have strong interest from another buyer."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning another buyer adds pressure for Bob to act quickly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows you to potentially negotiate down while still staying above your minimum. 

**Important:**  It's unlikely Bob will accept $15,000 knowing his valuation is $8,000. However, this opening offer sets the stage for potential counter-offers and lets you gauge his interest level."
