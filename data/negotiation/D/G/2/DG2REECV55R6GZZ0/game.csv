"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product at a competitive price of $1,400,000. It's a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still leaves room for a good profit for both of us. Let's find a middle ground that benefits everyone.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,275,000? It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can both walk away feeling satisfied.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but no higher. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at $1,225,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make a deal.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to find common ground.  While I'm willing to compromise, $1,225,000 is simply not enough for me. To make this work, I'd need to see $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this happen.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,225,000 and $1,250,000, which would be $1,237,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1237500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find a solution, but $1,237,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, at $1,243,750. This would be a fair compromise and allow us to both walk away feeling good about the deal. Let's see if we can find a way to make this happen.",1243750.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,240,000, but no higher. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1240000.0,Bob,10,
