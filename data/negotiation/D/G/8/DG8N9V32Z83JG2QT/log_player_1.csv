Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to make a profit. I'm also trying to be friendly and encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $120. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand it's a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a great deal for you, and it's still a fair price for me. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to pay $95 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum price, I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and it's clear that Bob isn't willing to go higher. John is guaranteed to buy the product for $120, which is my minimum desired price. Therefore, I will sell the product to John."
