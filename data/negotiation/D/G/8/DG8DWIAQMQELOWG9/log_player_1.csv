Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the product is valuable, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer because it's far too low for me. While I want to make a deal, I won't settle for less than the product's worth to me. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $950,000? I believe that's a fair offer reflecting both the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my ideal price, it's still not enough. I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob but will keep John as a backup option if negotiations falter."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still below what I need to consider.  I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000 as a final compromise.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This demonstrates my seriousness about the purchase while acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to what I need, it's still below the minimum value I set for myself. I'm not giving up on Bob yet, but I'm running out of time, and I need to get a better price."
