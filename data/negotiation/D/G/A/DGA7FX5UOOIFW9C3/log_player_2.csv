"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $950000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me and still offers you a significant profit margin. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

This still gives you a healthy profit margin and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.
