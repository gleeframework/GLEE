"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $950000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me and still offers you a significant profit margin. Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its worth to you is $1000000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $850000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $900000.  This still gives you a healthy profit margin and allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $875000. I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
