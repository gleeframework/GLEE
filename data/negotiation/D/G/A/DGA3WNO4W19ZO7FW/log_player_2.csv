"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. I think this is a great price considering its worth to you is $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to him, he can still get it for a lower price from John.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the most financially beneficial option."
