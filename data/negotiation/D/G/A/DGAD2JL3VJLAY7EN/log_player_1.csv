"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives him room to negotiate, while still ensuring I make a profit. I'll keep an eye on how he responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I want to close a deal, I won't settle for a loss. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate.  $1,600,000 is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's last offer, hopefully encouraging him to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and we're approaching the halfway point of our negotiations.  I'll make another counteroffer, but I'm also getting closer to the point where I might just sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price and signaling that I'm serious about making a deal. This offer gives Bob a chance to come up slightly, while still allowing me to get a fair price. If Bob rejects again, I'll be very close to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're nearing the end of our negotiations, and Bob's offer remains significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to risk further rounds with him and lose out on a guaranteed profit with John. It's time to close the deal with John and move on."
