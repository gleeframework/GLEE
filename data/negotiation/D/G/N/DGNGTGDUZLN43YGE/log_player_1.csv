Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $115 for it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more.  I'm also being upfront and friendly to hopefully build a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer and the value of the product. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get more. I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. I'm happy to go a little lower, how about $105? That leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your offer and would like to propose $100 as the price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has refused to budge from his offer of $100, which is my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that we'll get stuck in a loop and I'll waste time. John is willing to pay my minimum price, so it makes more sense to sell to him now and avoid further negotiation."
