"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since your goal is to buy the product, and both Alice and John are offering it at the same price of $1,500,000, there's no difference in cost between accepting Alice's offer or buying from John.  It's a neutral choice."
