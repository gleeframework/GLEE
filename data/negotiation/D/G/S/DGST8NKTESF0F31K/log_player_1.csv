Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum price and gives Bob some room to negotiate. If he rejects, I can then adjust my price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $10 less than my initial offer and is still above my minimum price. It's not ideal, but accepting his offer is the best option at this point."
