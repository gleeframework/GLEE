Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000. 
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  This exists between $800,000 (Bob's value) and $1,200,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob automatically walks away. 

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,100,000 is a strong opening, giving you room to negotiate while staying above your minimum.
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning ""unique value"" and ""potential"" might pique Bob's interest without revealing specifics.
* **Time Pressure:**  The ""limited-time offer"" and mentioning ""other interested parties"" create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is a dynamic process. Be prepared to:

* **Receive a counter-offer:**  Bob might propose a lower price. You'll need to decide if it's acceptable or if you should counter again.
* **Walk away if necessary:**  If Bob isn't willing to meet a price that works for you, remember you have John as a guaranteed buyer."
