"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm very interested in this product, though, and I'd be happy to pay $1,250,000. This is my best offer, and I'm sure it's a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you think it's a good opportunity. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,350,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value it holds for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I understand your position,  $1,350,000 is still more than I can comfortably pay.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows for a successful transaction for both of us.  I'm eager to finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're close, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that we could meet at $1,320,000. This is a slight concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
