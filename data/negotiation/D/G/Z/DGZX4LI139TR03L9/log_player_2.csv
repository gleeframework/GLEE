"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and your interest, I propose a price of $12,000 for it. This is a special offer considering its worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering the value of the product and your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $11,500. This is a fair compromise between our positions, and I believe it will be beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $11,500. This is a significant savings compared to buying from John.
* **Negotiation:** While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice might reject further offers or increase the price. 
* **Time:** With 10 rounds total, accepting the offer at this point ensures a good deal and leaves room for potential future negotiations or deals."
