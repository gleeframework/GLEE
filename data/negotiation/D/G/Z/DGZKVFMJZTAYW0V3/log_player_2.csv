"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,100,000.  This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I believe it's a great deal for you.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll be selling it to another buyer for a higher price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
