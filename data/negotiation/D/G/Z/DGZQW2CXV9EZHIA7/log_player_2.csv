Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $600,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  It's a fair price considering the potential of this product for your business.  Let's see if we can shake hands on this deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to push Alice's price down even further. Since I know I can buy the product from John for $800,000, I'll aim for a price that's close to that.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $750,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm prepared to make one final concession. How about we settle on $800,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  It's a win-win situation.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","This is an interesting development. Alice is offering me the exact price that I know I can get from John, which means she must be getting close to her minimum acceptable price. I'm not sure if I should accept her offer or try to negotiate further, but I'm also aware that I have the option to buy from John at the same price.

I'll reject Alice's offer and consider my options carefully.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $800,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if I don't get a better price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $750,000, and that's my final offer. If you can meet me at that price, I'm willing to do business with you."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
