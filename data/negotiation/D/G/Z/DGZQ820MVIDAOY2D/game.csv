"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to start with an offer of $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $10,500? This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get an amazing deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
