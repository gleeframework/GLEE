"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's talk!",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value, even considering your specific needs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and leaves room for both of us to feel good about the deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,500,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,500,000. I'm willing to offer $1,350,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a way to make this work.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
