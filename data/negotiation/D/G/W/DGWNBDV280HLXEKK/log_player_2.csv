"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this product! It's a fantastic opportunity to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100 and even higher than John's offer of $100. Buying from John is the most financially sensible choice."
