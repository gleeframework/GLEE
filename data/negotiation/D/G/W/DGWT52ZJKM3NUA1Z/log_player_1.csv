Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit lower than my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation. If Bob accepts, I'll make a good profit. If he rejects, I can see if he's willing to come up, or I can move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,500 is still a good price for both of us. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my desired price, and I'm confident I can't get much higher from him. It's still a decent profit for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by being too stubborn."
