"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good price, it's still worthwhile to try and negotiate further. You don't know Alice's bottom line, and there's a chance you can get an even better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing a willingness to negotiate. $700,000 is still a substantial amount, but it leaves room for further negotiation if Alice is willing to budge. This initial counteroffer also sets a baseline for future discussions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price significantly.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk is that she could reject my offer again, and the price could rise. At $775,000, I'm saving a significant amount of money compared to buying from John, and the likelihood of getting a much lower price from Alice seems minimal. It's time to secure the deal."
