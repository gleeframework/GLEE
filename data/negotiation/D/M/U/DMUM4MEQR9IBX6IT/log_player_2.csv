"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great deal for you on this amazing product! Would you like to make a serious offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to gauge your interest with her opening message.  This suggests there might be room for negotiation. 
* $120 is significantly more than Alice values the product at ($80). 
* You have a backup option with John at $150, so there's less pressure to immediately accept Alice's first offer.

By rejecting, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and open the possibility for Alice to lower her price."
