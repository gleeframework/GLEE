"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. It's a unique opportunity to own a valuable asset that will bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,100,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $1,100,000 is better, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to accept $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the benefits the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
