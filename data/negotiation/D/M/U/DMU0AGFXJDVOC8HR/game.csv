"I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to move forward with the purchase if we can meet in the middle.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize your perspective on the price, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher figure. I'm willing to meet you partway and propose a price of $1,650,000. This reflects a significant concession on my end while acknowledging the product's true worth.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate Alice's willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1,650,000 is a bit high. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
