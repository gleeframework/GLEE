"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to make a starting offer of $12,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose a price of $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my target profit. What are your thoughts?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $9,000 is closer, but still a bit above what I had in mind. Would you consider $7,000? That would be a good compromise for both of us, I think.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 was a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise at $7,000. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your initial offer of $6,000. What are your thoughts?",8000.0,Alice,5,
