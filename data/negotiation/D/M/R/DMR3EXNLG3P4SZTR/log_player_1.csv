Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're not giving away the product for less than it's worth to you. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This price is above Bob's value, but not so high that he'll immediately reject it. 
* **It's friendly:** The message makes it clear you're open to negotiation and that you think Bob would enjoy the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I really appreciate your offer, but $175 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $140 for it, what do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below your minimum acceptable price of $150.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired range.  

You have a good chance of getting a higher price from Bob, especially if you counter with a slightly lower offer than your initial price.  Selling to John for $150 is a safe option, but you have a chance to earn more by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand $175 was a bit high. I'm willing to come down to $160.  That's still a fair price considering the value of the product, but I want to make sure we both find a deal we're happy with. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Be within your acceptable range:** $160 is still above your minimum of $150.
* **Show flexibility:** You've lowered your price, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.
* **Be reasonable:** $160 is closer to Bob's offer, making it more likely he'll accept.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** The message reinforces your desire to find a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $150 for it, which is the same price I could get it for elsewhere.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $150 is your minimum acceptable price.  While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee you'll get a higher price.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and meets your minimum requirements.  Selling to John for the same price is a viable option, but accepting Bob's offer secures the deal immediately."
