"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course, but I believe this is a fair starting point considering its worth.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price of $1,300,000. Would you be willing to consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $900,000? I believe this might be a more feasible figure for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I must stay within my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I need to ensure I do not exceed my financial limits.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
