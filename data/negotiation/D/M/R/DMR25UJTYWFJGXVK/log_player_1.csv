Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering your desired value and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
