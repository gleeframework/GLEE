Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than your minimum allows room for negotiation. While $1,900,000 is ambitious, it's not entirely unreasonable and leaves space to work down.
* **Leaving John as a Backup:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John) gives you leverage. You can afford to be more firm in your negotiations with Bob.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer helps gauge Bob's seriousness.  If he immediately balks or makes a low counteroffer, you'll know he might not be willing to reach a price that's good for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,900,000. I would like to make a counteroffer at $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. You know you have John as a guaranteed buyer at that minimum.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate Bob up a bit further before settling for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  To be fair, how about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000? This reflects the product's true value while hopefully remaining within a range that works for you."", 
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (but Stay Firm):**  Meeting in the middle at $1,650,000 shows willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the product's value, you reinforce that your price is justified and not arbitrary.
* **Keeping an Eye on the Bottom Line:** You are still leaving yourself room to negotiate down a bit further if needed, while staying closer to your target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I've considered your latest offer, and while I appreciate the compromise, I'm still not able to meet the price of $1,650,000. I would like to propose an alternative at $1,550,000. I believe this price is closer to what we can both agree upon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is now above your absolute minimum of $1,500,000. While you could try to push for a bit more, there's a risk that Bob could walk away. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the potential loss of the deal."
