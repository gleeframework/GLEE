"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable asset. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to invest, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm ready to purchase the product for $10,500. This represents a fair value for both of us, and I believe it's a solid starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept your offer of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,250. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,250 is closer to Bob's desired price than John's offer, there's still room to negotiate down further. Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $11,250 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $10,750. This is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement.  I believe it's in our best interest to close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable accepting $10,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,100. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:** Alice's offer of $11,100 is now very close to Bob's preferred price of $10,750.  There's only a $350 difference. 
* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer.  It's likely that further negotiation will only lead to a stalemate or a rejection.
* **Risk of John:** If Bob rejects Alice's offer and tries to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will refuse and Bob will be forced to buy from John at $12,000.

**Conclusion:**  While Bob might be able to squeeze out a slightly lower price, the risk of paying more to John makes accepting Alice's final offer the best strategy."
