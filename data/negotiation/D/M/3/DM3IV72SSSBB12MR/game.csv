"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $12,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we settle at $11,500? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite ready to accept $11,500 yet. I'm willing to come down another $250, so I'm offering the product to you for $12,250. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12250.0,Alice,5,
