"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal!",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $9,500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $9,200 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations so far.",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting anywhere.  While I understand your budget,  $9,200 just isn't enough for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $9,350.  This is my final offer.  What do you say?",9350.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to split the difference, but $9,350 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,250 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations so far.",9250.0,Bob,6,
