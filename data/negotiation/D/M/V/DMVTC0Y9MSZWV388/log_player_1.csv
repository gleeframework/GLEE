Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $119. It's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:**  You have a backup offer from John for $100.

Offering the product for $119 maximizes your potential profit while still being attractive to Bob. He gains $1 in value compared to his alternative, and you make almost $20 more than your minimum and John's offer."
