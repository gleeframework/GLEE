Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?

We're getting closer, but I still have room to negotiate before considering John's offer."

Round 6

Bob has met our baseline price. There's no guarantee we can negotiate him higher, and it's not worth risking John's offer for a potentially insignificant gain."
