{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's higher than your minimum acceptable price ($12,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows Bob that you are serious about selling the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still below what you'd like to get. You can try to negotiate further with Bob to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  $12,500 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13,250.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13250. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to your minimum acceptable price, and it's likely you won't be able to negotiate much further.  Accepting his offer will ensure you get a decent price for the product without risking losing the sale entirely."
