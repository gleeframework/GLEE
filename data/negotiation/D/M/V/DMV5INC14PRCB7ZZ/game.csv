"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price of $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that price point be feasible for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your target price is $750,000, but I'm still looking to make a decent profit. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",825000.0,Alice,5,
