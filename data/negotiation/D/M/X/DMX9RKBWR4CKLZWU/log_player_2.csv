# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'm interested in buying the product, but I'm trying to save as much money as I can. Since Alice's offer of $120 is lower than what I'm willing to pay ($150), I'll accept her offer.
