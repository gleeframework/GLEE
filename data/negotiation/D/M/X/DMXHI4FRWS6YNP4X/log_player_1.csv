Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your value for it is $8,000. Let's make a deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
