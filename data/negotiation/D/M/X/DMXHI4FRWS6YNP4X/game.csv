"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your value for it is $8,000. Let's make a deal!",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer, but $9,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. This still leaves you with a good profit margin, and it's a fair price for the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal!",9000.0,Alice,3,
