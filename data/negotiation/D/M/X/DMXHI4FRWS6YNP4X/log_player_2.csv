"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get the product for a lower price than $9,500.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your value for it is $8,000. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer, but $9,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. This still leaves you with a good profit margin, and it's a fair price for the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $10,000 and leaves some room for profit.  At this point, further negotiation might risk losing the deal, so accepting the offer is the best course of action."
