"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity,  $1500000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product. This is my maximum budget, and I believe it reflects the product's value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm afraid $1200000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1350000. This is my best price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
