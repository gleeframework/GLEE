# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm afraid $1200000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1350000. This is my best price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?
