{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, giving me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for $100, as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price to $130, which is still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell for Bob's initial low offer. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my price, and I've already lowered my offer once.  At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Bob. It's better to sell to John for $120 and guarantee myself a profit."
