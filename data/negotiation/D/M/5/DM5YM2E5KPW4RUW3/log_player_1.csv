Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  $7,750 is still a bit low for me.  Could you do $8,100? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair deal, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $7,900? I think that's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's clear he's trying to stay well below the product's value to him ($10,000).  At this point, the difference between his offer ($7,900) and John's guaranteed price ($8,000) is minimal. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Bob for a potentially small gain.  Selling to John guarantees a profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued haggling."
