"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your asking price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This reflects the product's worth while still leaving room for negotiation.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $925,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to consider $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could go up to $775,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",775000.0,Bob,6,
