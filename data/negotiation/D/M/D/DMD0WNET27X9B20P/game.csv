"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your interest in the product. However, we cannot accept your offer of $600,000. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $900,000. This is a significant discount from our initial offer, and we believe it's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $700,000. Would you be open to that?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. We understand that you're trying to get closer to a price you're comfortable with. However, we're still not willing to go below $1,000,000. We're willing to meet you halfway again and offer a price of $850,000. This is our final compromise.",850000.0,Alice,5,
