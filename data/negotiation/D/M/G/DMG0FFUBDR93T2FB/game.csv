"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,900,000.  I believe this reflects the true value and potential of what's being offered.  What are your thoughts?",1900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,350,000. This represents a fair price considering the potential benefits I see in this product.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 significantly undervalues the product and the returns you'll see from it. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This feels like a fair compromise that considers both our positions.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits I see in this product and the price John is offering.  Let's find a way to make this work.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need you to understand that this product has significant value, and $1,350,000 simply doesn't reflect that.  To move things along, I'll come down to $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than fair.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my comfortable range.  Given my budget and the potential benefits I see in this product, I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This is a fair compromise, reflecting a significant step towards meeting your needs while staying within my limits.  I hope we can finalize this deal.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
