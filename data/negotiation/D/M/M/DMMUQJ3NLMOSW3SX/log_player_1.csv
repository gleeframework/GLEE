Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth, but I'm open to discussing it further if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher offer than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price above Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" and offering to discuss the price, you're framing the offer as potentially negotiable while subtly hinting at its worth.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  While you have a backup offer from John, you don't want to reveal this to Bob.  Knowing you have another buyer might make him less likely to negotiate.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and your assessment of his willingness to pay."
