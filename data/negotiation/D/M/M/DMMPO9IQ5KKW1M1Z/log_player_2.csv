"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $1,500,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice has come down to $1,300,000, this is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to negotiate and potentially get a lower price.  However, since Bob has a backup option of buying from John for $1,200,000, he should be prepared to accept that price if the negotiations with Alice don't go in his favor."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,275,000. This offer is a good compromise that's closer to my budget and still recognizes the value of your product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,275,000 and $1,300,000, which is $1,287,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,287,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,287,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $1,287,500 is still above his maximum budget of $1,200,000. Since Bob has a guaranteed alternative in John who is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000, it's more logical to take that option and avoid further negotiation. Continuing negotiations could potentially lead to a lower price from Alice, but it also risks Alice rejecting Bob's offer and leaving him without a deal.  The guaranteed price from John provides certainty and avoids potential risks."
