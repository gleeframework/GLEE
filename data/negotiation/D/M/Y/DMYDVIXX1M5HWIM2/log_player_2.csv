"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. It's a good starting point, but you can likely get a better price.  You're willing to pay up to $120, and you know Alice is willing to sell for $80, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to pay closer to $90.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still in a good position to negotiate. You're willing to pay $120, and Alice has dropped her price from $100 to $105.  There's still room for compromise, so continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle on $97.50?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $97.50. I'm willing to go up to $99.50, which is still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $99.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $99.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer.  You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is now offering the product for $99.50. This is a good deal for you, and you're close to your target price.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
