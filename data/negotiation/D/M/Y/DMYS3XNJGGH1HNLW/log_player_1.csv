"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This gives me a good starting point and allows room for negotiation. I'm confident the product is worth more than $15,000 to me, so I'm aiming for a significant profit.  Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is far too low.  I'm not willing to accept that.  I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $17,000. It's a significant decrease from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in my product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$11,000 is still too low for me. While time is running out, I'm not desperate enough to accept this offer. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if we can find a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $16,000. This is a compromise, but I'm hoping it's enough to entice Bob to agree. I'm feeling the pressure with the limited rounds, but I believe this product is worth more than $15,000 to me.  Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not convinced Bob understands the true value of the product. $11,500 is too low.  I'm going to counter again, but I'm starting to feel the pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $15,500. It's getting very close to my minimum, but I'm hoping Bob will finally see reason and agree to a price that's mutually beneficial. We're running out of time, and I'm starting to think about John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting very late in the negotiation and Bob is not budging. I'm not willing to go lower than $15,000, so I'm going to take John's offer. It's not ideal, but it's the best I can do at this point."
