"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm offering it to you for a very reasonable price. I'm looking to get $140 for it. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $150.
* Alice is offering the product for $140.
* You can get the product for $150 from John. 

Since you can get the product from John for $150, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy it from John. This allows you to save $10."
