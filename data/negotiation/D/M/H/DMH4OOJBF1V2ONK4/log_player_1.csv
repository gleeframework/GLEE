Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed even your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts, this offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we can confidently start high.  
* **Anchoring:** Offering $1,500,000 sets a strong anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, the final price is more likely to be favorable to Alice.
* **Urgency:**  The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Notes:**

This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable with a degree of risk. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer outright, but the potential for a significantly higher profit justifies the strategy."
