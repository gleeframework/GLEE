Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a deal if he pushes a little.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value, you provide a subtle justification for the higher price, even though you don't explicitly state what that value is.
* **Urgency:**  By mentioning other potential buyers, you create a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer and start a negotiation.

While John provides a safety net at $10,000, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a more profitable outcome."
