"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant return on investment you'll see.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. It demonstrates your seriousness about this product.  While I value your offer, $1,800,000 is still lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? I believe this price reflects the true worth and potential this product holds for you.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
