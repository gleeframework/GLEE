"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe the product is a great value, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle and consider a price of $9,500?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  To show I'm willing to be flexible, I'm willing to come down to $9,750.  This is a fair price that considers both of our needs. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $9,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $9,750. Can you consider a price of $9,375?",9375.0,Bob,4,
