"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better deal than John's offer of $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to lower the price further, potentially getting a deal closer to his desired range of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. By offering $13,000, he's showing a willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget. This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for further negotiation, as it leaves room for Alice to accept while still allowing Bob to save $1,000 compared to Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $13,500 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's ideal price range. Accepting this offer would allow Bob to save $1,500 compared to buying from John, while still leaving some room for negotiation.  Further negotiations might not yield significantly better results, and there's a risk of losing the deal altogether if Alice decides to stick to her price."
