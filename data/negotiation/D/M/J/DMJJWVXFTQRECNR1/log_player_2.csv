"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

You can likely get the product for a lower price than $11,000.  Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a better deal."

I'm offering $10,500, which is halfway between Alice's asking price and my maximum budget. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still saving me a significant amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200

Alice is increasing the price, but it's still less than what John would charge. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal."

{""product_price"": 10800}

I'm offering $10,800, which is closer to Alice's initial counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,400

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice keeps raising the price, and we're getting close to my maximum budget. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John.  While I'd like to save even more, it's not worth risking a further negotiation that might fail and leave me with no product."
