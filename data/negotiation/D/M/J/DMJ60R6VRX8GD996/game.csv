"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for a price of $950,000. This represents a significant value proposition for you, considering the product's worth to you. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a price closer to $900,000 to make this deal work for me. Let's try to bridge the gap and find a mutually beneficial solution.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there yet, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $875,000?  This would allow us both to come to a mutually agreeable deal. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort in finding a compromise.  $875,000 is still slightly below my minimum.  However, I am willing to accept your offer if you can increase it to $890,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let me know your decision.",890000.0,Alice,5,
