Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a fair price, as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $80 and leaves room for potential negotiation.  I believe this will be attractive to Bob, considering the product is worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial offer of $100, $90 is still a good price and above my minimum acceptable price of $80.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in future rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
