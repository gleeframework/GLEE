Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this unique product.  I know it's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's start with $1,400,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,200,000? I think that's a fair starting point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not ready to accept Bob's offer yet.  I believe the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,300,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $1,250,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product's value justifies it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation.  Accepting this offer will secure a good profit, and I don't want to risk losing out to John or spending more rounds without a deal."
