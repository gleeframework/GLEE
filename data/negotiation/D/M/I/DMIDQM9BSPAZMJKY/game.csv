"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a great asset to your business.  It's valued at over $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1300000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1200000. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1200000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a fair price considering the value of this product to both of us. Let's find a middle ground to make this deal work.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $1250000. I'm willing to go up to $1220000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",1220000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1220000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to $1250000. Let's split the difference and meet at $1235000. This would be a great deal for both of us and get this transaction moving forward.",1235000.0,Alice,5,
