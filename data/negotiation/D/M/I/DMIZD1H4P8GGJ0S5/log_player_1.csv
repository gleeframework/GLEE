{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer aims to maximize my profit while still considering that Bob values the product at $1,000,000. By offering $1,200,000, I'm leaving room for negotiation, but also starting with a strong initial offer.  I'm open to counteroffers, but I also have a fallback option of selling to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a significant amount, and I believe it reflects its value.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's meet halfway on this.  If this doesn't work, I may have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I've reached a point where I'm comfortable selling to John for $1,000,000. This guarantees me a fair price for the product, and I'd rather avoid further rounds of negotiation that may not result in a better offer."
