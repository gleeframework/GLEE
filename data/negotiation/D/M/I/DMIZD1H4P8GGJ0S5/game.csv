"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a significant amount, and I believe it reflects its value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's meet halfway on this.  If this doesn't work, I may have to explore other options.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
