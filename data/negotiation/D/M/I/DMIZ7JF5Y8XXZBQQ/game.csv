"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment for someone like you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you seeing the value in the product.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and it's closer to my target than your initial offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm ready to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us.  This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
