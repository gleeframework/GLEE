,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $900000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price, considering the value it will bring to my business.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1200000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1200000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $950000 for the product. I think this is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to my business, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can offer you the product for $1100000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1100000. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $980000 for the product. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've made a significant concession already, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm afraid I need to prioritize getting the best possible price for the product. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't meet at a price that's more favorable to me. I'm going to make a final offer of $1050000. This is my last offer, and I expect it to be accepted.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
