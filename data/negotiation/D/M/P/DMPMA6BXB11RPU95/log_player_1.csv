Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.  I'm proposing a price of $1,850,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation while aiming for a maximum profit. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing our bottom line. This allows for potential flexibility if Bob counters with a lower offer.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a guaranteed backup at $1,000,000 provides a safety net. This allows us to be more ambitious with our initial offer to Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  Negotiation is complex, and success depends on factors like Bob's personality, negotiating skills, and the perceived urgency of the sale."
