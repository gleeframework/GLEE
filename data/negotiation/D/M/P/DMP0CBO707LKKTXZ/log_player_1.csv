Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Knowing how much you could benefit from it, I'm willing to make a special offer just for you. Would you be interested in purchasing the product for $1,400,000?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible while ensuring he accepts.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, increasing his willingness to pay a higher price. 
* **Backup Plan:** We know John provides a safety net at $1,200,000,  so we can afford to aim high with Bob."
