"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.  This is a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which still gives you a significant saving compared to what the product is worth to you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to offer $9,500. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
