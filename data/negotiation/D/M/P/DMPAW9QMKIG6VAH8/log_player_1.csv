Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.  This is a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $10,000 is a strong starting point, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Appeal to value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob increases his incentive to negotiate. 
* **Win-win:** Framing it as a good deal for both of us builds goodwill and encourages a positive response.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great!  You've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects:  I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly, keeping in mind my minimum price of $8,000 and John's offer as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $8,000 is my minimum, it doesn't leave me with any profit margin. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I know the product is worth $12,000 to him, so there's room for compromise. 
* **John's offer as a backup:**  Having John's offer as a safety net gives me leverage in negotiating with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my original offer of $10,000, perhaps $9,000. This allows for a compromise while still ensuring I make a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which still gives you a significant saving compared to what the product is worth to you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** $9,000 is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Emphasize value:** I remind Bob of the product's high value to him, making my offer more appealing.
* **Flexibility:**  I show a willingness to negotiate,  encouraging Bob to come closer to my price.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've achieved a good outcome.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to offer $9,500. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:**  $9,500 is very close to my initial offer of $10,000.
* **Profitable:**  This sale will still bring me a significant profit, well above my minimum price.
* **No guarantee of a better deal:**  Bob's offer is reasonable, and continuing to negotiate might not lead to a significantly higher price. There's always the risk he might walk away, forcing me to settle with John's offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'm satisfied with this outcome. I've managed to secure a good price for the product, and the negotiation process has been relatively smooth."
