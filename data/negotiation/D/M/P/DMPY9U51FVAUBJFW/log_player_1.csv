Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's significantly higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. The message is friendly and aims to build a positive relationship."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is at your minimum, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting, you can make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $10,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway on our initial offers. How about $12,500? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $1,000 less than your previous counteroffer and is getting closer to your desired price.  Accepting this offer is the best option in this scenario. It ensures you get a better price than John's offer and avoids further rounds of negotiation that might result in a lower price or a stalemate."
