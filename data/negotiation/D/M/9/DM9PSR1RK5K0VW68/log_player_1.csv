Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get the price down to something closer to $8,500.  I'm confident this product is worth that to me, and I'm sure we can find a way to make this work for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.
