"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm proposing a price of $9,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get the price down to something closer to $8,500.  I'm confident this product is worth that to me, and I'm sure we can find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get the price down, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,800. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,800 is a significant improvement from her initial $9,000 offer and is getting closer to Bob's desired price point.  Given that there are only 7 rounds left, accepting this offer is a good strategy.  Continuing to negotiate risks the possibility of running out of rounds and being forced to buy from John at a much higher price."
