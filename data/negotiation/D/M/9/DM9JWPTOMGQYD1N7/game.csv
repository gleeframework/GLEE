"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $1800000 and $1500000. I'm offering you the product for $1650000. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1650000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1500000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
