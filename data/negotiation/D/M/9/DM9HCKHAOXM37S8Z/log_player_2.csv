You should reject Alice's offer because you can get the product for a lower price from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price, but you have a guaranteed alternative."

I'm offering Alice $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from her initial offer and is still within my budget. It also leaves room for some potential negotiation.  While I could go straight to John,  I'm aiming for a slightly better deal, hoping Alice might be willing to meet me halfway."

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, it's still not the best deal. I'm going to reject this offer and make another counteroffer, hoping to secure a price closer to $1,250,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that's significantly higher than John's offer."

I'm going to offer Alice $1,300,000. This is a compromise, meeting her halfway from my previous offer.  I'm hoping that the fact that I'm willing to negotiate and move closer to her price will encourage her to accept the offer.  If she rejects again, I'm ready to go with John's offer."

Alice has come down a bit, but her price is still higher than what John is offering. I've already negotiated twice with Alice, and the gap is shrinking slowly. However, I'm running out of time and the price is still a bit higher than my budget.  Therefore, I'll go with John's offer, as it's the most secure and guaranteed option."
