"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your response and understand your position.  While I'm eager to find a workable solution, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  Could we consider a compromise of $1,350,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,350,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
