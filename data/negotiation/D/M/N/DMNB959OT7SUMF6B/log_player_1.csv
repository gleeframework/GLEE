Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to Bob, so I'm hoping he'll bite. However, I'm prepared to counteroffer if he doesn't and to ultimately sell to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't lead to a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to accept a price that's less than half of what I believe the product is worth. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price. However, I've already spent time negotiating and Bob seems unwilling to budge much further.  To avoid further delays, I'll take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
