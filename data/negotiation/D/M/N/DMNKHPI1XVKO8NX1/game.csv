"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you first. Let's start with a price of $1500000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the value I place on it.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I understand this is a significant investment, and I want to make sure it's a good deal for both of us. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1350000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for some negotiation room. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. However, $1350000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $1250000 is getting closer to what I'm looking for, we're still a bit apart. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's try to close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, Alice. However, $1300000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1220000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",1220000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1220000 is still significantly below what this product is worth to me.  To be honest, I'm getting close to accepting John's offer of $1000000, as I don't want to waste any more time.  However, I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'm willing to lower the price to $1280000. This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I will be forced to move on to other buyers.",1280000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go above $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1260000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider buying from John.",1260000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate, but $1260000 is still not a price that works for me. I understand this is a significant investment for you, and I want to make sure this deal is mutually beneficial.  I'm willing to compromise one last time, but I need to be closer to $1300000. I'm willing to accept $1290000, but this is my final offer. If we can't agree, I will have no choice but to accept John's offer of $1000000.",1290000.0,Alice,9,
