"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm opening with a price higher than the product's worth to me, but still within a range that Bob might consider. This allows for negotiation and leaves room for me to come down.
* **Emphasis on value:**  Highlighting the product's uniqueness and value might incentivize Bob to think about the potential benefits of owning it.
* **Setting the tone:**  The message is polite but firm, indicating that I am serious about selling and that this is a good opportunity for him. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets a high bar and sets the stage for potential negotiations.  I will monitor Bob's response and adapt my strategy based on his reaction. If he rejects the offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and the remaining rounds before potentially switching to John as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While it's tempting to consider selling for $850,000, I have a better option with John, who is willing to pay $1,000,000.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'll use this opportunity to counteroffer with a price that's closer to my desired value. This will allow me to potentially reach a deal with Bob while still ensuring I receive a price closer to my minimum.

**Next Round:**

I'll need to carefully consider my counteroffer. I'll aim for a price that's still attractive to Bob, but also reflects the value of the product to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,050,000.  This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and it demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I acknowledge Bob's budget and express willingness to compromise while still emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Meeting in the middle:** I propose a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value proposition:** I reiterate the product's worth and highlight the potential benefits for Bob.
* **Reassurance:** The message assures Bob that I'm committed to finding a solution and that this counteroffer represents a significant step towards a deal. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to show Bob that I'm serious about finding a compromise while still maintaining a price that is profitable for me. I've lowered my price significantly, indicating flexibility and demonstrating a willingness to meet him halfway.  This approach might encourage Bob to reconsider his offer and potentially come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still outside of my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm hopeful it's a fair starting point for continued negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While it's tempting to accept his offer, given we're only on round 4 and have 6 rounds left, I believe I can still negotiate a better price.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate.  I will aim for a price closer to my minimum in the next round, while also being mindful of the remaining rounds and the potential of selling to John. 

**Next Round:**

I'll need to carefully assess Bob's willingness to compromise. I'll likely counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my minimum, but higher than Bob's offer, aiming for a deal in the next few rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your increased offer. While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the value of this product. I'm prepared to come down to $980,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can finalize this deal in the next few rounds."", ""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging progress:**  I acknowledge Bob's increased offer and express appreciation for his willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to justify my asking price.
* **Compromise:**  I propose a price that is significantly lower than my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's offer, indicating my commitment to reaching a deal.
* **Urgency:**  I mention the remaining rounds to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to consider my offer.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maintaining a price close to my minimum and incentivizing Bob to accept. I've made a significant concession, demonstrating flexibility while also emphasizing that I'm not willing to go any lower.  This approach could encourage Bob to make a final counteroffer to close the deal within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $980,000 is a good offer, it's still a little higher than what I'm comfortable with. To finalize this deal, I'm prepared to offer you $960,000. This price reflects the value of the product and is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  With only 4 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal. It's better to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale, even if it's slightly below my minimum, rather than risk losing the opportunity completely.

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer in this round ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a stalemate or losing the deal altogether. While I would have preferred to secure a price closer to my minimum, this offer provides a satisfactory outcome with only a small margin of loss."
