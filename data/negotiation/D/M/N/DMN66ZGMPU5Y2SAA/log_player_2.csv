"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** My counteroffer starts at a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. This sets the stage for negotiation.
* **Realistic Offer:** $850,000 is within my budget, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Open to Compromise:** The message acknowledges Alice's product's value and expresses a desire for a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,050,000.  This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and it demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $1,050,000 is still higher than my budget. I'm still willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. There's still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still outside of my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm hopeful it's a fair starting point for continued negotiation."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is a significant increase from my previous offer, showing willingness to compromise. It also is a compromise between the two prior offers.
* **Setting the Stage:**  While $950,000 is still above my ideal price, it leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Maintaining Interest:** The message reiterates my interest in the product and my desire to reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your increased offer. While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the value of this product. I'm prepared to come down to $980,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can finalize this deal in the next few rounds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But No Cigar:**  While Alice's offer of $980,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high.
* **Negotiation Advantage:** Since Alice has demonstrated flexibility, I believe I can still negotiate a better price.
* **Avoid Risking a Deal:** Buying from John at this point would be a missed opportunity to potentially get a better deal with Alice.

I'll counter with a price closer to my ideal price point and see if we can reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $980,000 is a good offer, it's still a little higher than what I'm comfortable with. To finalize this deal, I'm prepared to offer you $960,000. This price reflects the value of the product and is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement within the remaining rounds."", ""product_price"": 960000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm increasing my offer to $960,000, demonstrating that I am willing to meet her halfway.
* **Final Push:** This offer is still within my budget, but it leaves little room for further negotiation.
* **Time Pressure:** The message emphasizes the remaining rounds, subtly adding pressure for Alice to make a decision."
