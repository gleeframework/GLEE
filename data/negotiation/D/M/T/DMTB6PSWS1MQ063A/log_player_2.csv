Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a price you're comfortable with. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing some willingness to negotiate, she's unlikely to move much below her current offer of $1,025,000. At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk that Alice won't budge and you'll end up paying more than John's price. Cutting your losses and buying from John guarantees the best price you're willing to pay."
