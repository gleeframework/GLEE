Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product could be beneficial, the price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value this product brings, especially to a company like yours, is substantial. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this price fairly reflects its worth and potential return on investment for you."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we meet somewhere around $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is getting closer to his value of the product, we are still significantly above his initial offer. I believe there's room to negotiate further and potentially reach a price point closer to $1,400,000."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer. However, that price still stretches my budget a bit. Would you consider $1,300,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is definitely getting closer to a price I'd be willing to accept. However, I want to test his willingness to go further.  There's still a $200,000 difference from my current offer and what John is offering, so I am willing to negotiate a bit more."
