"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As the owner, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,200,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product has potential, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering your offer of $1,050,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,150,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle at $1,100,000? I think that's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not quite comfortable with the price of $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,125,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
