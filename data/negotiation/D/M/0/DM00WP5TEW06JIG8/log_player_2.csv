"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within the realm of possibility. It reflects his budget constraint while leaving room for negotiation. By offering a specific price, he's demonstrating his seriousness and initiating the bargaining process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10000 to try and make this work. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. He's willing to pay $8,000 maximum and can still get that from John. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully secure a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing that he's willing to compromise. The offer is still below Alice's price but reflects his willingness to meet halfway.  The message also reinforces the value proposition and the need for a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're coming up on your offer, but $9000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product and the potential for a long-term partnership, I'm willing to go down to $10500. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While Alice is showing some willingness to negotiate, the difference between their desired prices remains significant. With five rounds remaining, the risk of continuing negotiations and failing to reach an agreement is high.  

It's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product from John for $8,000. This guarantees him the lowest possible price and avoids the potential for further negotiation delays and setbacks."
