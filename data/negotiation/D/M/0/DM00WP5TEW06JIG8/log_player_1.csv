"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:** $12,000 allows for potential negotiation down to a price that is still profitable for me, but potentially attractive to Bob.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation and consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. Let me know if you're interested in this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.** Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **I have 10 rounds and the option to sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer.** I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob or go with the guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable outcome.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000 to try and make this work. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with a Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still keeping the price above his initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterate Value:**  Mentioning the value of the product reinforces the justification for a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages continued dialogue and avoids escalating the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $9,000 is still below my goal of $15,000.
* **Potential for Improvement:**  I've already moved significantly from my initial offer and Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate. There's potential to push for a higher price.
* **Selling to John is a Secure Option:**  I have the security of selling to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory result."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're coming up on your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product and the potential for a long-term partnership, I'm willing to go down to $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a margin above his last offer, indicating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Potential:** I'm emphasizing the potential for a long-term partnership to encourage Bob to see the value in a slightly higher price.
* **Fairness & Needs:**  I'm framing the price as ""fair"" and reflecting ""both our needs,"" emphasizing a collaborative approach rather than pure negotiation."
