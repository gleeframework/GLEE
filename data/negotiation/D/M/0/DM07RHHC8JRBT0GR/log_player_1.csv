Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefit you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little, while still ensuring a significant profit above your minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant benefit"" to make the offer more appealing.

By setting a high but justifiable price, we increase the chances of securing a deal with Bob, which is more profitable than the guaranteed sale to John."
