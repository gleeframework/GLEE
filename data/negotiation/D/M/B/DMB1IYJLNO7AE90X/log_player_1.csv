"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($800,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000) leaves room for negotiation. This allows you to potentially secure a price well above your minimum. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** The initial offer helps gauge how eager Bob is to purchase. A strong reaction might indicate he's willing to pay a premium. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind your backup offer from John for $800,000. This provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $600,000 at this time.  I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his own stated value of the product. This suggests there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and work towards a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While still above Bob's offer, reducing the price by $100,000 shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Holding Ground:** The new price of $900,000 keeps the negotiation well above your minimum of $800,000 and closer to the product's actual value.
* **Maintaining Firmness:** The message emphasizes the product's worth, reinforcing the idea that significant concessions can't be made."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000. This is a fair compromise that demonstrates my serious interest in purchasing the product, while also respecting my financial constraints. Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Bob's offer has increased significantly, indicating progress and his strong interest.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The offer is still below John's guaranteed $800,000. There's potential to negotiate further and secure a price closer to your target. 
* **Time Consideration:** You have several rounds remaining, allowing for continued negotiation without jeopardizing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  Let's settle this â€“ I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is my final offer, as it's crucial for me to receive fair value for this product."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This offer meets Bob halfway between his last offer ($750,000) and your previous asking price ($900,000), demonstrating a strong commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Finality:** By stating this is your final offer, you create a sense of urgency and signal that you're unwilling to go lower. This encourages Bob to seriously consider the deal.
* **Profitable Outcome:** $850,000 is a significant profit margin above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and John's standing offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to receive fair value, and I'm committed to finding a deal that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $825,000. This is a significant step closer to your last offer, and I believe it demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product. Let's reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $825,000 is a very good offer, exceeding your guaranteed sale price with John. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, demonstrating a commitment to the deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for more (like $837,500 by splitting the difference again) risks Bob walking away, leaving you to accept John's lower offer. It's better to secure a strong win now."
