"I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,500,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the product is valuable, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $1,300,000? This is still a good price for me, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. Would you consider $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your target price, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I can meet you at $1,280,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
