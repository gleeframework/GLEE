Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to make this offer attractive for you.  Would a price of $1,300,000 be agreeable to you?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and she has a guaranteed offer for $1,500,000. Starting high allows room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for Bob to feel he's getting a deal:** While the price is significantly higher than Bob's valuation, it's still significantly lower than Alice's guaranteed offer. This could make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal if he negotiates the price down even slightly. 
* **""Exclusive opportunity"" language:** This creates a sense of scarcity and importance, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  Her goal is to find a price that's acceptable to both parties but maximizes her profit."
