"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $15000. Let me know if you're interested!",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $20000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $15000 for it. This is my best offer.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm thinking of a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $17500? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $17500 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16250. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.",16250.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $16250. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $16750? This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",16750.0,Alice,5,
