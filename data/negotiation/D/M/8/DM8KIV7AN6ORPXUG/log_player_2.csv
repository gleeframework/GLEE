"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $15,000 is over his budget, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, so he's starting with a lowball offer. $8,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay. This counteroffer allows for some negotiation while still leaving room for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no need to accept Alice's offer.  He should counteroffer again to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

Bob is making a counteroffer of $9,500. This is closer to Alice's last offer, but still lower than her asking price. He is trying to find a middle ground and demonstrate that he is willing to negotiate but still wants to get the best deal possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000. The negotiations with Alice have gone on for a while and they are not getting any closer to a price that Bob is comfortable with.  Alice has now offered $13,000, which is still over Bob's budget.  Rather than continue to negotiate with Alice, it's more efficient for Bob to buy the product from John at his pre-determined price."
