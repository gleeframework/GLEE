Alice's offer:

This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a profit, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go below $7,300. I've already compromised a lot by meeting you halfway earlier, and I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we try $7,200? This is a very competitive price, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer. You've already managed to bring the price down significantly from the initial $7,500, and at $7,200, you're saving $800 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or you having to buy from John at a higher price is high."
