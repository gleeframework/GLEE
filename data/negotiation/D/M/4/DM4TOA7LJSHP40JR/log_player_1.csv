Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your business.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. I know that's a significant investment, but I'm confident it will provide a strong return for you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John is guaranteed to buy the product for $1,500,000, Alice's minimum acceptable price is met.  The goal is to get as much from Bob as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so Alice needs to start significantly higher.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering a price of $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while still staying comfortably above Alice's minimum. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk with the potential for a higher profit than selling to John immediately."
