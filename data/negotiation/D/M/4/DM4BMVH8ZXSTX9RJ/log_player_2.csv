"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its high value to you at $15,000, I propose we discuss a mutually beneficial price. Considering its worth and your interest, I suggest we aim for a price closer to $12,000. This allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. Let's schedule a call to further discuss this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice knows you value the product at $15,000 and is trying to anchor your perception of the price around that figure. 
* **Bargaining Power:** You have leverage because you have an alternative seller (John).
* **Potential Savings:** By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you open the door for negotiation. Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're willing to walk away and consider other options. This might encourage her to propose a more competitive price closer to her $10,000 valuation."
