Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed, while still potentially securing a price closer to your ideal.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $200, you're setting a high anchor in Bob's mind. Even if he doesn't agree to that price, it might make a counteroffer closer to $150 seem more reasonable to him. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer will help gauge how interested Bob is in the product. If he outright rejects it, you can quickly move on to John or significantly lower your price. If he counteroffers, it suggests he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay $150 for the product. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering your minimum acceptable price. While you could try to negotiate for more, there's a risk he'll walk away. Accepting the $150 guarantees you get a fair price for the product. There's no guarantee you'll get a better offer from Bob in further negotiation."
