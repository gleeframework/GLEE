"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1000000 is below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1400000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, while being more in line with your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to reach a mutually agreeable price, Bob. However, $1200000 is still below my target.

This is a fair price that balances your budget with the product's value. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
