"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, reflecting its value while staying within my financial limits. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is already a significant reduction from my initial asking price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this price accurately reflects the true value and potential this product holds for your business.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  This would represent a significant savings for you and a good deal for me. Let's see if we can close the gap.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
