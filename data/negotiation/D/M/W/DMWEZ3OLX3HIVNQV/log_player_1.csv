Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,900,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, reflecting its value while staying within my financial limits. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  This would represent a significant savings for you and a good deal for me. Let's see if we can close the gap.

**Reasoning:**  At this point, Bob is offering the exact amount John is willing to pay.  There's no benefit to continuing negotiations with Bob, as it's unlikely he'll go higher. Accepting John's offer guarantees the desired outcome."
