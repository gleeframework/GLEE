Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe it's a fair price that considers its value.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can get a better price with further negotiation.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

This is a fair price considering the value to you, and it allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. How about we settle in the middle at $1,075,000?  This shows I'm willing to move closer to your price, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.

While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate,  $1,075,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my desired range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  $1,075,000 is closer, but I need to stay above my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This represents a significant compromise, and it's a price that I believe is fair considering the value of the product to you.  Let's aim for a final agreement this round."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

Round 6
