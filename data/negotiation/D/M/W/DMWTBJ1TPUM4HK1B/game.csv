"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find immense value in. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. While I understand your perspective,  $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Could we settle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,175,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. My final offer is $1,210,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your desire for a fair deal.  Let me know what you think.",1210000.0,Alice,5,
