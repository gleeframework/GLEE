"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find immense value in. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. While I understand your perspective,  $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,175,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. My final offer is $1,210,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your desire for a fair deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,210,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,210,000

At this point, Alice has signaled this is her final offer. While I could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of her walking away. $1,210,000 is a reasonable price and a good deal compared to John's offer."
