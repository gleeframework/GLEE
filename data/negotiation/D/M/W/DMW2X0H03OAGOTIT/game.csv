"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree your product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me Alice. $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, I think $775,000 is still a bit low. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $825,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're very nearly at a deal here.  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I want to work with you, but I can't go higher than $800,000.  That's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that it's a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'll counter with $815,000. It's a compromise, but I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,7,
