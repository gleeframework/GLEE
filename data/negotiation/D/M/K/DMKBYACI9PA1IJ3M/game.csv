"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $750,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still allows me to recoup my investment and offers you a great opportunity for growth.  Let's keep the conversation going.",850000.0,Alice,3,
