"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe would be a great asset to you. My asking price is $9,500. I'm open to negotiation, so let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), leaving room for negotiation.
* **Optimistic but realistic:**  $9,500 is a good starting point, potentially leaving room for a couple of rounds of negotiation before I need to consider John's offer.
* **Friendly approach:** A positive message encourages Bob to engage and consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While I want to make a deal,  $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Opportunity to negotiate:** I have 8 rounds left, and I can still potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing that I can sell to John for $10,000 gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately it's a bit lower than I can go.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to see if we can make this work. Let's find a price that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my initial offer.
* **Maintain value:**  $9,000 is still a significant amount for Bob and closer to my minimum price. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm emphasizing finding a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Setting a deadline:** I'm using this counteroffer to signal that I'm serious about selling and Bob needs to act quickly to secure the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I am still looking to stay within my budget. Would $8,500 be possible for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer, $8,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation leverage:**  I have 6 rounds left, and with John's offer as a safety net, I can continue to push for a higher price. 
* **Time is on my side:**  The more rounds we go through, the more likely Bob is to increase his offer, especially if he wants the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to drop to $9,200. This is a fair price that respects both of our needs.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:**  I'm making a small concession, but not a huge one, demonstrating flexibility while staying close to my desired price.
* **Reinforcing Value:**  I'm emphasizing ""fair price"" to remind Bob of the product's worth and my commitment to a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Time Pressure:**  I'm still holding onto some leverage by suggesting that this might be the last opportunity for Bob to secure the product at this price. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone, hoping to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I've made an offer of $8,800 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Although Bob is increasing his offer, $8,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Time is on my side:** I have 4 rounds left, and I can continue to negotiate with Bob. The more rounds we go through, the more likely he is to increase his offer further, especially if he really wants the product.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $10,000 gives me leverage and allows me to hold out for a better deal with Bob.
* **Potential for a better price:** There's still a chance I can get closer to my desired price by continuing negotiations with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my asking price.  However,  $8,800 is still a bit short.  Let's meet in the middle: I'm willing to go down to $9,100.  This is a fair compromise and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.  I'm ready to close the deal if you're willing to go this high."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to compromise by coming down from my previous offer.
* **Fairness and Mutuality:**  I'm emphasizing ""fair compromise"" and ""finding a solution that works for both of us"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Urgency:**  I'm signaling that this might be my last offer, adding a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision.
* **Focus on the Deal:**  I'm shifting the focus to closing the deal rather than continuing endless negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I've decided to increase my offer to $8,900 for the product. I hope this proposal helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While Bob's offer of $8,900 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price of $10,000.
* **Two rounds left:** With only two rounds left, the chances of Bob increasing his offer significantly are slim. 
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $10,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of reaching the end of the rounds without securing a satisfactory price.

Given the limited time and the guaranteed offer from John, I've decided to sell the product to John for $10,000. This ensures that I receive my desired price and avoid the potential risk of a less profitable outcome with Bob."
