Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm looking for a price around $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed and potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** While a direct opening offer of $19,000 might seem high, the phrase ""given its value"" implies there are reasons behind the price.  
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message is open for discussion. By asking ""What do you think?"", Alice invites Bob to counter-offer and engage in the negotiation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, we don't know his financial limits or how much he's willing to spend.  
* **Negotiation Skills:** Alice's ability to negotiate effectively will play a significant role in the final price."
