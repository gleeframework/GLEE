Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum desired price of $1,200,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price and even lower than what the product is worth to him.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far too low.  The product is worth a lot more than that, even to you. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product holds value, but I have a firm budget in mind. I can go up to $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, his latest offer of $700,000 is still below my minimum desired price.  I'm confident John is a secure buyer and will pay my desired price of $1,200,000.  Selling to John ensures I achieve my desired profit and avoids further negotiation."
