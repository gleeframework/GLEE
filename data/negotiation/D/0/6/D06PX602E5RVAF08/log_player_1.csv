"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a price of $950,000 is a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with an offer slightly higher than what you hope to receive. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he can bring the price down a bit. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $950,000, we establish a high anchor in Bob's mind. Even if he doesn't agree to this price, it will make lower offers (closer to $1,000,000) seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While we want to maximize profit, we also need to keep John's offer in mind. Starting too high might make Bob walk away, forcing us to accept John's lower offer.  

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $900,000 is a significant step down from his perceived value of $1,000,000.  While it's tempting to accept and secure a good profit, we have room to negotiate further and potentially close a deal closer to his valuation.  We are still early in the negotiation process."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table. I understand your position on the budget and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $925,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This approach often feels fair to both parties involved. It demonstrates willingness to compromise while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Incremental Steps:**  We are moving in smaller increments now ($25,000) which signals to Bob that we are getting closer to a final agreement.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  We are still significantly above John's offer, allowing us to maintain a strong bargaining position.

Let's see what Bob thinks of this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has significantly dropped his offer to $875,000. While it's still a profitable price, it's getting too close to John's offer of $800,000.  We need to hold firm to try and secure a better deal.  Bob's willingness to negotiate suggests there's still room for us to reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we both see the value in this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.  It's a significant discount and a fair offer considering the potential this product holds. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We are making a smaller concession this time, only coming down to $900,000. This shows Bob we are willing to be flexible but also sets a firm boundary.
* **Bottom Line:**  By stating our ""bottom line,"" we create a sense of urgency and finality. It encourages Bob to make a decision and potentially meet our price.
* **Highlighting Value:** We are reiterating the product's value to remind Bob why he's interested and justify the price.
* **Time Constraint:** As we progress through the rounds, it's important to keep in mind that time is a factor.  We need to start moving towards a final decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to get the best deal I can. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I think is a fair price considering its value. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Margin:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is still a significant profit over John's offer of $800,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away, forcing us to accept John's lower offer. Accepting now secures a substantial profit.
* **Time:**  We are over halfway through the negotiation rounds.  Dragging it out further might not yield a significantly better result. 

It's a good deal, and it makes sense to accept now and avoid the risk of losing out on a substantial profit."
