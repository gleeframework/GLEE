"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm very interested in this product, and I'm prepared to pay up to $1,500,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,500,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm still hoping to find a price that benefits us both. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000.  This reflects the value I know this product will bring to your business.  Let's work together to close this deal.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident this product will be valuable for my business, and I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I can't go above $1,550,000.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
