"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for you, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your operations.  I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,100,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to establish a favorable starting point. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves space for Bob to counteroffer and feel involved in the process, increasing the chances of a successful deal. 
* **Above Minimum:**  The offer is significantly above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($800,000), ensuring a profitable outcome even after potential concessions. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message adopts a collaborative and enthusiastic tone to foster goodwill and encourage a positive response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Target:** While $950,000 is a substantial amount, it's significantly lower than our initial asking price and leaves a considerable sum on the table compared to Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There are still eight rounds remaining, providing ample opportunity to negotiate a price closer to our target range.
* **John is a Backup:**  The option to sell to John for $800,000 serves as a safety net, ensuring we don't have to settle for a price too far below our minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the product's value is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer represents a fair compromise, reflecting the significant benefits the product will bring to your business."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're lowering the price by $50,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong profit margin.
* **Highlighting Value:** We're reiterating the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential benefits and justifying a higher price. 
* **Compromise Framing:**  By positioning this offer as a ""fair compromise,"" we aim to nudge Bob towards a collaborative mindset.
* **Pressure to Negotiate:** By remaining firm but making a concession, we encourage Bob to engage more actively in the negotiation and potentially reveal his true willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value I place on the product, I am willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,000,000 is a very good price, exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($800,000) by a significant margin.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Bob has steadily increased his offer, signaling his strong interest. Accepting now demonstrates good faith and avoids the risk of him walking away. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal sooner rather than later allows us to reinvest the earnings or use them for other opportunities. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** While there's a slight chance we could extract a bit more from Bob in subsequent rounds, there's also the risk he could lower his offer or walk away altogether. Accepting now locks in a very favorable outcome."
