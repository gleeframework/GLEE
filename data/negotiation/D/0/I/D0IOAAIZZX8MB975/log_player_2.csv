"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $110. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering the product for $110. This is a good price, but you can try to get it for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you be willing to let it go for $105? "", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $105, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. How about we meet in the middle at $107? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and $107 is within your budget.  It's a good compromise and saves you $3 compared to buying from John."
