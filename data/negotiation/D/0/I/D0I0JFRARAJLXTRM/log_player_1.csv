Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but unfortunately, I cannot go above $15,000 for this product. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.

Explanation: Bob is holding firm at his maximum price of $15,000.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield a better result. Since John is offering the same amount, it makes sense to take the guaranteed sale with John."
