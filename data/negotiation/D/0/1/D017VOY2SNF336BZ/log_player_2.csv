"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal. Since the goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows Bob to potentially get an even lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a $50,000 discount. This is a bold move, but it demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate and potentially pushes Alice towards a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $920,000 is a good compromise. It's a better deal than buying from John, and while it's not as low as Bob's initial counteroffer, it's still a significant savings.  There's no guarantee that continued negotiation will lead to a lower price, and the risk of Alice walking away or Bob missing out on a good deal is high.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price, and allows him to move on."
