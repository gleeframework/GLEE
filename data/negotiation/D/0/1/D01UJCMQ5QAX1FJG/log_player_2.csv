Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $11,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and it's not worth the risk of her sticking firmly to her current price.  Buying from John guarantees the $10,000 maximum price without further negotiation."
