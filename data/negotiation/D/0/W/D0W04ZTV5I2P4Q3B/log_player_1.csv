Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($8,000), but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, potentially giving us a price we both agree on.
* **Positive tone:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the benefits of the deal for both of us.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I will consider his counteroffer. 
* If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I will make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* If negotiations stall, I will consider selling the product to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my desired price:** $9,000 is very close to my starting offer of $9,500. 
* **Time is a factor:** While I would prefer to get closer to $10,000,  I don't want to risk Bob changing his mind or going to another seller. 
* **Potential for a future deal:** Accepting Bob's offer builds a positive relationship.  I might be able to negotiate a better price with him in future transactions.

**Next Steps:**

* I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
