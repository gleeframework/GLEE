Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $750,000.  This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, we cannot start at that price. We need to leave room for negotiation or a counter-offer. 
* **Strategic Offering:** Offering it slightly below his valuation at $750,000 creates a sense of a deal and increases the likelihood of him accepting without further negotiation. 
* **Time Constraint:**  The 24-hour limit creates urgency, prompting Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid losing out on what he perceives as a valuable opportunity.
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 with John, ensuring we don't lose money if Bob rejects the offer.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while ensuring a high chance of a successful sale."
