Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher price.  While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $15,000 is still too low for me.  I'd be happy to accept $17,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 17500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $17500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $17000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $17,000 is a good compromise and a significant improvement over John's offer.  It's important to consider the value of my time and the risk of losing the deal altogether."
