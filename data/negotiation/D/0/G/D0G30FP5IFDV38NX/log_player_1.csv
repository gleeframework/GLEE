"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for discussions."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're beginning with a strong offer significantly above both our minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's eagerness.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" to justify the high price, without revealing specific details that Bob could use against us in the negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""fair starting point for discussions"" signals our willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor High:**  Influence Bob's perception of the product's value by setting a high anchor price.
2. **Gather Information:**  Observe Bob's reaction to our initial offer to better understand his willingness to pay. 
3. **Maintain Flexibility:** Leave room for negotiation while keeping our walk-away option (selling to John) open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. My counteroffer is $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above his perceived value, it's still below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We have room to negotiate, and selling to John at this point would be leaving potential profit on the table. We'll counter-offer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  However, the value of this product is substantial, and I'm confident it will bring you a significant return. To move this forward, I'm proposing a price of $1,700,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while recognizing the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're reducing our price by $200,000, signaling flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, the new price is still significantly above both Bob's offer and our minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:**  We're reiterating the product's value and its potential to benefit Bob, reinforcing the justification for a price above his initial offer.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to guide the negotiation towards a price point closer to our minimum acceptable price while leaving room for further adjustments if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your latest proposal, Alice, and while I understand the value of the product, I still feel that we're not quite aligned on pricing. My counteroffer is now $1,600,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better outcome. 

Accepting this offer secures a profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
