"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $90. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. She might come back with a counter-offer closer to her $80 valuation.  If not, you can always buy from John for $100."
