"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  You can try to get a lower price from Alice before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $1,050,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than Alice's initial offer and closer to Bob's target price.  While there's always the possibility of negotiating further, the risk of Alice rejecting a lower counteroffer and potentially having to buy from John at $1,000,000 outweighs the potential savings of a few thousand dollars."
