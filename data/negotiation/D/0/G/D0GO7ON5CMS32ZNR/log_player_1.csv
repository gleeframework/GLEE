Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is above your minimum:** You're still earning more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** It's lower than Bob's perceived value, allowing for some potential back-and-forth.
* **Shows confidence:** You're not giving it away for cheap, but you're also open to negotiation. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is above your minimum, it's still lower than what you initially proposed, and there's a chance to get closer to your desired price. 

You'll send a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between $9,000 and your initial offer of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $10,500? That's still a significant saving for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is above your minimum:** You're still earning more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **Is closer to Bob's offer:** This shows you're willing to compromise and meet him halfway.
* **Leaves some room for negotiation:** It's still lower than your initial offer, allowing for further discussion. 

Let's see if this is the magic number!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to a deal, but I still think $9500 is a more reasonable price. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, it's in your best interest to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Close to your desired price:** $9,500 is significantly closer to your initial offer of $12,000 than Bob's previous offer of $9,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's no guarantee that continuing the negotiation will result in a higher price. Bob might be firm on his current offer.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate could mean losing time and potentially missing out on a good deal, especially since you can sell to John for $8,000.

Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale that is above your minimum and is likely the best outcome in this scenario."
