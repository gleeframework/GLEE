{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts with a strong price point ($20,000), acknowledging the value of the product while leaving room for negotiation.  I've included a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $17000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $17,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $17,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $18,500? This is a truly unique product, and I think it would be a great investment for you."", ""product_price"": 18500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is unique, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $18000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $18,000 is close to my minimum value, and I'm not sure how much further I can push him. It's a good deal considering his initial reluctance, and it's better than selling to John for $15,000.  I'll accept his offer."
