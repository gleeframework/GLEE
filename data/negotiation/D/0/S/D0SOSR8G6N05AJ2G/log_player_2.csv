Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not comfortable going as low as $115, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $130 is the lowest I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

**Reasoning:** Alice is very slowly lowering her price.  At this rate, it's unlikely we'll get a deal that's significantly better than John's offer of $120. It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed savings."
