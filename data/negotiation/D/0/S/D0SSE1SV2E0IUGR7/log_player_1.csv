Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $90 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still believe I should be able to purchase the product for $90. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob seems firmly set at $90 and is unlikely to budge.  It's not worth risking further rounds to potentially get a slightly better deal from Bob. Taking the guaranteed $100 from John is the best option."
