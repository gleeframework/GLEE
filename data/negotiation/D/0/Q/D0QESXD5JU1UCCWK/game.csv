"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your initial offer of $1,000,000 is lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise given the value of the product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
