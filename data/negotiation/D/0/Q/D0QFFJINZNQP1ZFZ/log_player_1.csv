I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This gives me a good profit margin while still potentially being appealing to Bob, as it's likely he values the product higher than my minimum value of $1,500,000. 

If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not taking a significant risk by aiming high."
