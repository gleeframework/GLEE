"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's in great condition and worth every penny! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $140 is higher than your minimum of $120, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $140 is lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($150), giving him an incentive to buy.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You have space to lower the price if needed to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is still a decent profit, I'm aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a price closer to my initial asking price.  

Let's see if we can push for a bit more!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $130 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a price a bit closer to my initial offer. How about $135? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a little more wiggle room."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $135. How about $132? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:**  $132 is just a few dollars away from my initial offer of $135.
* **Good profit:** It still provides a decent profit above my minimum of $120.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer and counter again, I risk him walking away entirely. 

With only 6 rounds left, it's better to secure a good deal now rather than risk losing the sale."
