{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, offering a price that is a bit lower than Bob's estimated value, but still above your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing your potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I can potentially get a better price by negotiating further.  I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about $135? This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $130 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is very close to my desired price point and significantly better than selling to John for $120. It's a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept it to close the deal."
