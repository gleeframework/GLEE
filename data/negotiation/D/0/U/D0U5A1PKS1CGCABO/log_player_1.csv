Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have a strong baseline. Your goal is to see how much more Bob is willing to pay. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a significantly higher price than your minimum allows room for negotiation and gives the impression the product might be valued even higher elsewhere.
* **Justification:**  While not stating the exact value to you, the message hints at the product's worth (""highly valuable"") to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while still being appealing enough to avoid Bob outright rejecting the offer."
