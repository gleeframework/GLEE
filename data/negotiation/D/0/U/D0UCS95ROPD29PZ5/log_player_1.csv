Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm asking for $1,200,000.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit. 
* **Assessing Bob's interest:** A high initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's eagerness. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have gone even higher. If he negotiates, you can work your way down towards a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Backup plan:**  The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer gives you a strong negotiating position. You're not desperate to sell, so you can be firm in your pricing. 

**Important Note:**  While this strategy aims to maximize profit, be mindful of not alienating Bob with an unreasonably high offer."
