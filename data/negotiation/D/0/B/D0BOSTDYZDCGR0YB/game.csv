"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the market value,  I'm still confident in the unique value of this product and its potential benefits for your operations.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price fairly reflects the product's value while also being within a range that could benefit both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1,050,000, which is the same price I offered in the previous round.
