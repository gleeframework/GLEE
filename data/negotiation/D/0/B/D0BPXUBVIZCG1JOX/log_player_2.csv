Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a stretch for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000. It's still a great price considering the product's value. I can offer you a slight discount, though. How about we meet at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $1,025,000. At this point, cutting losses and buying from John for $1,000,000 makes the most sense to maximize savings."
