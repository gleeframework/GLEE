Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your minimum ($120) at $119 creates a sense of urgency and a perceived bargain for Bob.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, starting slightly higher leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested. 

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
