"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but I'm hoping to get a good price from Bob without having to resort to dealing with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and while I'm tempted by the quick sale, I'm going to try to push for a better price.  I have more rounds to work with, and I'm not desperate.  Let's see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping that this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to sell for a price significantly lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, and while I'd still prefer to get more, it's a decent outcome. I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for the same price. It's time to close the deal."
