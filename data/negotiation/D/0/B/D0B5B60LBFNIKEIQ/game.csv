"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor of something truly innovative. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see potential in the product, $1200000 is significantly higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm interested in exploring a deal closer to $800000, reflecting the value I see in the product currently. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to that range?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I have to consider the value I've put into the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1000000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a bit high for me. I believe a price closer to $850000 would be a fair compromise given the value I see in the product. This would also give us both a good deal. Let's keep working towards a mutually beneficial outcome.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $950000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and my investment. I believe it's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still a bit out of my price range.  Given the value I see in the product and the need for us to reach an agreement, I'm prepared to offer $900000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also giving us both a good deal.  I believe this would be a good compromise.",900000.0,Bob,6,
