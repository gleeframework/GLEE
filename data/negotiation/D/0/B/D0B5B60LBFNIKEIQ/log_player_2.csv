"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor of something truly innovative. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's best to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see potential in the product, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm interested in exploring a deal closer to $800,000, reflecting the value I see in the product currently. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to that range?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I have to consider the value I've put into the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1000000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $1,000,000 is still above your budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can reach a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I believe a price closer to $850,000 would be a fair compromise given the value I see in the product. This would also give us both a good deal. Let's keep working towards a mutually beneficial outcome."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $950000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and my investment. I believe it's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your ideal price, $950,000 is still above your budget. You still have several rounds left, and you can try to negotiate further.  You could also consider buying from John if you feel Alice isn't going to come down much further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  Given the value I see in the product and the need for us to reach an agreement, I'm prepared to offer $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also giving us both a good deal.  I believe this would be a good compromise."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $925000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $925000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but $925,000 is still outside your comfort zone.  You only have a few rounds left, and it's getting risky to continue negotiating with Alice.  Given that you can get the product from John for $800,000, it's a safer bet to go with John and ensure a deal within your budget."
