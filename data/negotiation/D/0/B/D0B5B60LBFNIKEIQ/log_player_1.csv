Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see potential in the product, $1200000 is significantly higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm interested in exploring a deal closer to $800000, reflecting the value I see in the product currently. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

Let's keep working towards a mutually beneficial outcome.
