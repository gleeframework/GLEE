I'm still holding out for a higher price than $14,000. While I'm getting closer to John's offer, I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."

Bob's offers have been consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I could continue negotiating with Bob, I'm running out of time and John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price. It's better to secure the sale with John and avoid further risk of losing even more money."
