Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still exceeding your minimum selling price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,999 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you make a substantial profit if he accepts.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale to John at $12,000, so there's no risk of losing money.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing potential profit."
