Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob has room to negotiate and still get a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can adjust the price up or down depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a nice product, but $125 feels a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's worth trying to negotiate a bit higher. Since you know the product is worth more to Bob, there's a good chance you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is definitely my minimum, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. Would you consider $110? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  How about $105? That's a fair compromise in my opinion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's best to accept Bob's offer.  You're getting $5 more than your minimum and selling the product to Bob keeps your profit higher than selling it to John.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Bob walking away and you ending up with $100 from John."
