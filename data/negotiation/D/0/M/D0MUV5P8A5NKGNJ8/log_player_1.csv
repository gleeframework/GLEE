Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially even more than my minimum asking price. Considering its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to maximize your profit, so starting with a price closer to his valuation makes sense. 
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** Offering $1,350,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 to John, ensuring you don't lose out completely if Bob rejects the offer.

This strategy aims to secure a price significantly higher than your minimum while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
