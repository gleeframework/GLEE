"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

 Bob's offer is too low.  It's worth more to me to continue negotiating and see if we can reach a more agreeable price.  I'm willing to go lower than my initial offer, but not that low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is significantly below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that still allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $950,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob is still too low, and I don't want to risk going through another round of negotiation.  While $1,000,000 is less than my ideal,  it's a safe bet and ensures I don't lose out on a substantial amount of money."
