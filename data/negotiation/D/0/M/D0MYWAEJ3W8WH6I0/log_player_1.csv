Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed and potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Provide Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly anchor Bob's perception to a higher price point.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" and the question ""What are your thoughts?"" signal that you're open to discussing the price further.

**Strategy:**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you're in a strong position. Aim high with Bob, but be prepared to negotiate down if he shows resistance. You can always gradually decrease your asking price in subsequent offers until you reach an agreement or hit your minimum."
