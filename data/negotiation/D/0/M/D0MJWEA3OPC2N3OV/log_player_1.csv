Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product. However, $1,350,000 is a bit steep for me. Considering the value I see in it, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we still have rounds to negotiate. It's likely he's willing to go higher, especially since he's emphasizing the product's value to him. We'll continue to counter in a way that shows flexibility but also maintains pressure."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you clearly recognize the inherent value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground: $1,200,000. I believe this price respects both our positions and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome."",

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're strategically moving closer to Bob's offers, applying pressure while still aiming for a higher price. By now, Bob likely understands our determination to secure a strong deal. This offer is a firm but fair attempt to finalize the negotiation."
