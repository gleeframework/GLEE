"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, the product is worth $1,500,000 to me. Considering your interest, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's value to both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value to both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. Considering your interest and the value you see in the product, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also acknowledging your budget constraints. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, so I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This price is a good balance for both our needs and reflects the value of the product.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to get closer to my desired price. Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This is a final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
