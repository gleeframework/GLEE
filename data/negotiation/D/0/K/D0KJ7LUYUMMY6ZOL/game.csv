"I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm eager to make a deal with you, $1,250,000 is still a bit below my desired price.  Let's try $1,300,000.  This is a good compromise, and it brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the price I was initially offered by John. I'm trying to be fair, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can we meet at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate you trying to be fair.  While $1,250,000 is tempting, I'm still looking for a bit more to make this deal work.  Let's compromise at $1,275,000. This is a small step closer to your offer, and it would help me bridge the gap to my minimum price.",1275000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,225,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet at this price.",1225000.0,Bob,8,
