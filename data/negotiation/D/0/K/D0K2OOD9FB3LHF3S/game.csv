"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $100 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $90 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $80.  Would that be possible?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is a great price for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I think $85 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done.",85.0,Alice,5,
