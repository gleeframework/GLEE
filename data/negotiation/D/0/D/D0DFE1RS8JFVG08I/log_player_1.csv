{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you. I'm asking for $130 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm not willing to sell it for less than that. It's better for me to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $115? That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm trying to be as close to my budget as possible. How about $112.50? That's my final offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $112.50 is still a bit lower than I would like, but it's close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  It's not worth risking losing the sale and having to go through more rounds of negotiation. I'm better off accepting his offer and securing the sale."
