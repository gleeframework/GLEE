"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Its value is significant, and I believe it aligns perfectly with your needs.  Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,800,000."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  Beginning with a strong offer anchors the negotiation in your favor. While $1,800,000 is significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, it leaves room for negotiation and signals the product's high worth.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""exclusive opportunity"" and how it ""aligns perfectly with [Bob's] needs"" aims to justify the high price tag. 
* **Leaving Room:**  This initial offer allows for flexibility in subsequent rounds. You can gradually decrease your asking price while gauging Bob's reactions.

The goal is to find a balance between maximizing profit and securing the deal within the 10-round limit, always keeping the option of John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is quite high. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum price and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting this would mean a substantial loss for you. While selling to John for $1,000,000 is an option, it's still early in the negotiation with Bob. There's room to maneuver and potentially secure a better deal than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is undeniable. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Lowering the price by $300,000 demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, but still keeps the offer significantly above both your floor and Bob's initial offer. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  Re-emphasizing the product's inherent value helps justify the still-high price.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving while gauging Bob's true interest and flexibility.  You're aiming for a balance between maximizing your potential profit and closing the deal within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but the gap is still too wide for me.  To be fair, I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, $900,000 is still below your guaranteed offer from John. You are early enough in the negotiation to hold firm and see if you can negotiate Bob closer to your desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to accept a price of $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to see this deal closed."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Step, But Controlled:** This counteroffer represents a $200,000 decrease from your previous offer, a more substantial concession to signal you're moving towards a deal.
* **Anchoring to a Higher Value:**  By emphasizing the size of your price reduction, you're implicitly reminding Bob this is a valuable compromise.
* **Sense of Urgency (Subtle):**  Phrases like ""find a middle ground"" and ""desire to see this deal closed"" subtly introduce a bit of urgency without resorting to hardball tactics.

You're now past the halfway point in the negotiation. The goal is to incentivize Bob to significantly increase his offer while still staying above your fallback option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This represents my maximum budget for this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met John's offer of $1,000,000. While you started higher, Bob has clearly stated this is his maximum budget. It's unlikely he'll go any higher. Accepting this offer secures you a fair price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
