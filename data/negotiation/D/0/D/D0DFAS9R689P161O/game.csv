"Bob, I understand your perspective, and while $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This is a fair price that recognizes your potential gain while allowing me to make a worthwhile profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $875,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $890,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal.",890000.0,Alice,5,
