# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. This is a great deal for you, as you've said it's worth $80 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
