This offer represents a significant profit for me while still being attractive to Bob.  It leaves room for negotiation, but it's a good starting point to see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value of the product to me and its worth to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below what I consider fair. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000 at this point."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position and respect the value of the product to you. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below the $1,100,000 I'm willing to accept. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for a significantly higher price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,060,000 for the product. I believe this price is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while staying within my budget.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm getting impatient. We've been negotiating for a while, and the gap is still significant. While I could continue negotiating, I'm not sure how much higher Bob will go. Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees a much higher profit and saves me the time and effort of further negotiation."
