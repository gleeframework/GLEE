{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $9,500 is above your minimum of $8,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's below Bob's perceived value of $10,000, giving him incentive to negotiate and potentially reach a price that works for both of you.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** The message is friendly and straightforward, focusing on the product's value and the price.

By offering $9,500, you create a strong starting point for negotiation and leave yourself room to adjust if needed."

# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still below my desired price.  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I understand your price point, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me at this time.  Would you be willing to consider $9,000?  It's a fair price, and I think it still leaves room for a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is higher than John's offer of $8,000. While it's still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum.  It's likely that Bob won't go any higher, and I don't want to risk losing this sale. I'll accept his offer."
