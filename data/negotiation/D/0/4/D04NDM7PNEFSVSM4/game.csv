"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to part with it for $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. Given my research and what I'm willing to pay, I'm offering $1200000.  This is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1800000. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to find a middle ground, but $1800000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go to $1500000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a deal that benefits both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more move. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll sell the product to you for $1700000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
