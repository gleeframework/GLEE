Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $13,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($10,000) but lower than Bob's perceived value ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Friendly Approach:**  I'm starting with a friendly message to build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable with the negotiation.
* **Open to Counteroffers:**  I'm not making a final offer, but leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000 gives me a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I am interested in purchasing it, but I can only pay up to $12,000. Let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:** While $12,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum of $10,000. This means I have room to negotiate further and potentially get a higher price.
* **Potential for a better price:**  I believe I can still get a better price than $12,000. Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to pay a significant amount. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage in the negotiation and signal that I'm not desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low just yet.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product and allows for a smooth transaction for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($13,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000). This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to maintain a good relationship.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not making it a final offer, leaving the door open for further negotiation if Bob rejects."
