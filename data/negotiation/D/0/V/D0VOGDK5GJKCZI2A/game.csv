"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this high-end product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product's value, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $8,500? I believe that's a fair price.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've invested a significant amount in this product, and I need to ensure I get a fair return. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to charge at least $11,000. This is my best and final offer for now. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $9,500? That's a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly by offering $11,000, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to charge at least $10,500. This is my final offer for now. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  $10,000 is the absolute highest I can go. This offer represents a fair deal for both of us, considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go below $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to charge at least $10,250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're so close to a deal!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,125?  This would be a win-win for both of us.",10125.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to split the difference this time. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I'm not going any lower. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",10500.0,Alice,9,
