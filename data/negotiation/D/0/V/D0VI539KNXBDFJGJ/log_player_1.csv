Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a great deal, given its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's lower than my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value and accept, but if not, we can work towards a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. While he is willing to pay a premium, it's still not enough for me.  I will counteroffer to try and find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum value, so I'm going to accept it. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for $15,000 and it avoids further negotiation."
