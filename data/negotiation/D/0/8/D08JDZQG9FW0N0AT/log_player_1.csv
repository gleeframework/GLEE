{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to his valuation as possible without exceeding it, ensuring he's likely to accept.
* **Backup Offer:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, so we need to aim higher.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, still landing us a great deal."
