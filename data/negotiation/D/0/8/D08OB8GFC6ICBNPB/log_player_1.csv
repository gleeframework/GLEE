"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,450,000. This is a significant discount from Bob's estimated value but still leaves a healthy profit margin for me. I'm confident this will be a strong starting point for negotiations, and I'll adjust my approach based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm confident I can still negotiate a better price, given his interest and the fact that he's already made a counteroffer.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I believe this is a fair price considering his demonstrated interest and my own valuation. I'm hoping this will be enough to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I'm confident I can secure a higher offer by continuing the process.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,375,000. This is a further compromise, but I'm confident it's still a fair price considering Bob's value of the product and the fact that we're getting closer to a deal. I'm hoping this will be enough to secure a deal, but I'm prepared to keep negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price,  $1,325,000 is above my minimum acceptable price and we are approaching the end of the rounds. I'm accepting Bob's offer and securing a deal."
