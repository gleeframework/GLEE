"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are looking to save as much money as possible and Alice's offer is still too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I agree the product has potential, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm proposing a new price of $825,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point.  It's worth seeing if you can push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $750,000.  This is the most I can afford at this time, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession and propose a price of $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $800,000 is the same as John's price.  Since you have the option to buy from John immediately, there's no need to risk further negotiation with Alice."
