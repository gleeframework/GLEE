"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her, and it's within my budget. However, it's still higher than what I'd like to pay. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  Given the value of the product to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to $1,400,000 for this deal to make sense for me. Would you consider $1,350,000?

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything over $1,300,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
