"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10,500. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go to $9,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that to me. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
