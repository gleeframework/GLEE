"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $750,000.  That's a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay and what you're willing to sell it for.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000.  That's a good price for both of us, and it's closer to my budget.  What do you think?",825000.0,Bob,4,
