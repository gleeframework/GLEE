Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a great investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your limits:** You have a strong fallback option with John ($1,500,000). This means you should aim for a price higher than what Bob values the product at ($1,000,000), but lower than your guaranteed sale price.
* **Finding a balance:** Offering the product for $1,400,000 creates a significant profit margin while still potentially being attractive to Bob. There's a chance he might value certain aspects of the product higher than initially assessed, or be willing to negotiate a bit above his initial valuation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the offer is $1,400,000, the message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer. This allows for some back and forth to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential earnings while acknowledging Bob's perspective and leaving room for a successful negotiation."
