Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950000 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product.
