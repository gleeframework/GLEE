"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment. My starting price is $1200000.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $900000 is a bit too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950000 is getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference. How about $1000000? This would be a great deal for both of us, and would let us close the deal quickly. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. However, $1000000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $975000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can make this deal happen.",975000.0,Bob,6,
