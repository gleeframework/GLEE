Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,060,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting very close to my desired price. With only 3 rounds remaining, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. It's better to accept this offer and secure the product at a price that's still significantly lower than what I'd pay John.  I can always try to find a better deal later if needed, but it's important to keep in mind the time limit and potential risk of losing the deal entirely."
