Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You're aware that the product is worth $10,000 to Bob. This information is powerful in negotiation.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation and potentially increases your profit. 
* **Backup Plan (John):**  You have a safety net: John is willing to pay your minimum acceptable price. This allows you to be more assertive with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you know his perceived value, consider factors like Bob's budget constraints and his potential willingness to pay a premium for the product's benefits.
* **Relationship Building:**  Even though you have John as a backup, maintaining a positive relationship with Bob might be valuable for future interactions or business."
