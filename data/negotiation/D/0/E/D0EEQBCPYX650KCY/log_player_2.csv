"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know is worth a significant amount to you.  I understand its value to you is $1,200,000, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. My offer is $1,000,000. This price is considerably lower than what you'd gain from owning the product, and it also allows me to earn a substantial profit. What do you say?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, while John wants $1,200,000. 
* **You still get a good deal:** Even though the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, getting it for $1,000,000 saves you $200,000.

This decision maximizes your savings while still achieving your goal of obtaining the product."
