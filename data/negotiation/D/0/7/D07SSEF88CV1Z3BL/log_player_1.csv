Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,500.  I think this is a fair price considering its value."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible to maximize my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:** Offering a price too close to John's offer ($10,000) leaves potential profit on the table.

This strategy balances risk and reward. If Bob accepts, I make a great sale. If he rejects it, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer."
