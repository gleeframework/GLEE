This offer starts the negotiation at a relatively high price, giving you room to negotiate downwards if needed. It's important to be polite and open to Bob's counteroffers, but remember your goal is to maximize your profit.  If Bob rejects, you can then assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing to negotiate or if you're better off selling to John for $1,000,000."
