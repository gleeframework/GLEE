"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'm only willing to pay $120 for this product.  Let me know if that works for you.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  Let's see if we can make this work.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $145. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still more than I'm prepared to pay. I'm sticking with my offer of $130.  This is my final offer, let me know if it works for you.",130.0,Bob,6,
