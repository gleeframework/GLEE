Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($150) but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay closer to my valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While I want to sell, I can't accept such a drastic discount. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. How about $125?  It's a good price for both of us and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's make a deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still too low.  While I'm open to negotiating, I'm not willing to go that low.  John is offering a price I'm comfortable with, so I'll sell to him."
