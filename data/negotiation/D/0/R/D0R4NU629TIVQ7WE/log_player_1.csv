Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a significant discount from its true value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit above what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering what I'm willing to spend and the value you've placed on the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm confident I can do better with further negotiation. I will try to push Bob closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that low.  $8,500 is simply not enough for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $10,250. It's a fair price, and it allows both of us to get a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,250 is still a bit steep.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to achieve our goals. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a higher price, and I'm not yet desperate enough to accept. I'll try to push Bob a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be fair. However, $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $9,750.  This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's reach an agreement, and I'll get the product to you right away."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $9,750 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,250 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,250 is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can achieve a better outcome. I'm not willing to settle yet, as I'm confident I can push Bob further with continued negotiation.  The deal with John is still on the table, providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob falter."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  However, $9,250 is still a bit below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $9,500.
