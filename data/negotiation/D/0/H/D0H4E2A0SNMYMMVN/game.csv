"Alice,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $7,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $8,500.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",9800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,800 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,200.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",8200.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that we're getting close to the wire, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price, but I need to make a minimum of $8,500 to break even. I can offer it to you for $9,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",9000.0,Alice,7,
