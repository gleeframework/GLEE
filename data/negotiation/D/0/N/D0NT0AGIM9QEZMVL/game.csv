"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. It's currently valued at $1500000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This represents a significant opportunity to acquire this product at a price well below its market value. I'm confident that it will be a profitable investment for you. Please consider my offer carefully. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
