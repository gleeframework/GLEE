"Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a starting price of $16,000.  I'm confident it's worth the value, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $16,000 is a bit outside of my budget.  I'm really interested in this product and would be happy to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is quite a bit below my bottom line.  I could consider letting it go for $14,000. This reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $10,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a bit more. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $12,000? That would be a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,5,
