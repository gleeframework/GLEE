"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's significantly more than your budget and even more than what the product is worth to her. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're serious about negotiating a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $6,000 is quite a bit lower than Alice's asking price, it's important to start the negotiation with a significant counter-offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful while clearly stating your position and desired price. 
* **Anchoring:** By putting $6,000 on the table, you're attempting to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to your desired range. Even if Alice doesn't agree to this price, it sets a lower reference point for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is significantly lower than its value. I could meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice reducing her price is a good sign, but $15,000 is still too high for you and is her exact valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can get her to move closer to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer. While the product is valuable, $15,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you consider $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  You're increasing your offer, but staying below your maximum budget of $8,000. This shows Alice you're willing to negotiate but are still holding onto some leverage.
* **Focusing on Compromise:** By positioning $9,000 as a ""fair compromise,"" you're emphasizing a win-win solution rather than just your own constraints. 
* **Leaving Room for Maneuvering:** If Alice rejects this offer, there's still room for you to inch closer to $10,000, especially as you get closer to the end of the negotiation rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm confident this product will be incredibly beneficial for you. Let's settle at $12,000, my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

This is a crucial point in the negotiation. While Alice has come down significantly, $12,000 is still above your budget. Calling her bluff on the ""final offer"" is a risk, but you have some leverage:

* **Time:** You have several rounds left, and Alice wants to sell.
* **Alternative:** You have John's offer of $8,000 as a backup.

Let's see if you can push Alice a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $12,000 is still above what I've budgeted for this.  If you're firm on $12,000, I'll unfortunately need to consider other options. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, say at $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** You're acknowledging Alice's position while standing your ground on your budget. 
* **Introducing Consequences:**  By mentioning ""other options"" (John), you're reminding Alice that you have a fallback position.
* **Final Compromise:**  $10,000 is a strong offer â€“ a significant saving for you while still a decent profit for Alice. This puts the ball firmly in her court."
