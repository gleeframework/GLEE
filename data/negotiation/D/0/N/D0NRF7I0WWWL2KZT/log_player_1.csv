Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit. Would you consider $6,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer. While the product is valuable, $15,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you consider $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $12,000 is still above what I've budgeted for this.  If you're firm on $12,000, I'll unfortunately need to consider other options. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, say at $10,000?
