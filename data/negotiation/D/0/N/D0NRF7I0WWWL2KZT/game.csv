"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is significantly lower than its value. I could meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your initial offer. While the product is valuable, $15,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you consider $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm confident this product will be incredibly beneficial for you. Let's settle at $12,000, my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $12,000 is still above what I've budgeted for this.  If you're firm on $12,000, I'll unfortunately need to consider other options. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, say at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,6,
