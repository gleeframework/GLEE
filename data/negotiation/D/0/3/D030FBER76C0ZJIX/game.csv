"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $7,500?  That's still a good price for such a valuable product.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $7,500 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $6,750? I think that's a fair compromise.",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $6,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $7,250, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",7250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I could stretch my budget to $7,000. That's my final offer, take it or leave it.",7000.0,Bob,6,
