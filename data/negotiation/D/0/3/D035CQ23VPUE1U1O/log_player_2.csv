"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a special offer just for you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While Alice's offer is higher than her product's worth to her, it's still $3,000 cheaper than buying from John. 
* **You're still getting a good deal.**  You're buying the product for $12,000, which is $3,000 less than your own valuation of the product."
