Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be interested enough to make a counteroffer, allowing me to potentially get a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send Bob a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $175. This is a compromise, as it's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial price. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing offer for Bob while still ensuring I earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $155 is slightly higher than John's offer of $150.  Since my goal is to maximize my profit, accepting Bob's offer is the best choice in this situation."
