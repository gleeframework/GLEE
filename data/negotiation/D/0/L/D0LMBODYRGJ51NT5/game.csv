"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its value. Let's start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value I've placed on this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's aim for a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that should satisfy both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $850,000. This price is fair considering the product's value and my budget constraints.  Let's close this deal and avoid further negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer, but I'm not willing to sell at $850,000. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, which is a 10% discount from my initial offer. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you say?",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $920,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to offer $880,000.  This is a fair price that's a compromise for both of us, and lets us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's close this deal.",880000.0,Bob,6,
