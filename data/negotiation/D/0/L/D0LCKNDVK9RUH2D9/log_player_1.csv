Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $170. I think you'll find it's a great value!"", 
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining or gives the impression of the product's high value.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** While I don't know Bob's exact willingness to pay, I know the product is worth $150 to him. Offering it slightly above that at $170 might entice him while still netting me a profit.
* **Backup Option:**  I have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
