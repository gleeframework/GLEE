"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value to leave room for negotiation. I believe this will pique Bob's interest without immediately discouraging him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $100. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still staying above my minimum acceptable value. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also determined to get a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. There are more rounds left, so I'm going to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering the price again, but I'm still holding out for a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable value.  I believe this shows Bob that I'm serious about selling the product, but I'm also not willing to give it away for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $87 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and Bob doesn't seem to be willing to budge much. With limited rounds left, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100, which is my guaranteed minimum. This ensures I don't risk losing more time trying to negotiate with Bob and possibly ending up with a worse outcome."
