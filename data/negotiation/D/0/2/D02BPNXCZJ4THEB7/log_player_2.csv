Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice's offer is $110, which is much higher. I will reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

I'm offering Alice the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.  This price is still lower than what the product is worth to her, but it's the best I can do without buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than I'm willing to pay. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $85.  This is still below Alice's ideal price, but I'm hoping we can reach a deal in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. While I'm running out of rounds, I'm confident we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

I'm increasing my offer again to $87, which is closer to Alice's last offer and still within my budget. With only 4 rounds remaining, I believe this offer is reasonable and we can hopefully close the deal."
