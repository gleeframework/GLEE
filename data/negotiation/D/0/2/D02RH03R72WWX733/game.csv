"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth, and I believe you might be the right person. I'm offering the product to you for $2000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this exceptional product. What are your thoughts?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1850000. I hope this is a more reasonable price for both of us.",1850000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $1800000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $1750000. I'm willing to make a small compromise, so I'll counteroffer at $1775000. I hope this is a more reasonable price for both of us.",1775000.0,Bob,6,
