"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  While $1,120,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product, and it's a price I feel comfortable with.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,100,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,087,500? This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1087500.0,Bob,6,
