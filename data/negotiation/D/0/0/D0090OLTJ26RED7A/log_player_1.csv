Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit. If Bob rejects, I can gauge his interest and adjust my price accordingly.  Remember, I have a guaranteed fallback option with John at $800,000, so I'm not afraid to lose this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good price, I believe I can do better. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial asking price and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still holding firm on a price that's closer to my initial value assessment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would have preferred a higher price, $920,000 is a good deal considering the negotiation progress. It's closer to my ideal outcome and significantly higher than John's offer.  This ensures a more favorable outcome than selling to John."
