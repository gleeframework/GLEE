Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to get more than $8,000, so $10,000 is a good starting point.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so there's room for both of you to compromise. 
* **It shows confidence:** Offering a higher price upfront can make you seem confident and less likely to settle for a lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, there's still room for improvement. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to try for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate.  $8,500 is a bit low for me, considering the value of the product.  How about $9,500?  I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, Alice, but I'm working with a tight budget. Could we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good point to accept. Bob has moved closer to your desired price, and you're getting $1,000 more than you would from John.  Further negotiation might get you another $500, but it's not worth the risk of losing the sale."
