"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be of significant value to you. While I can't disclose the exact nature of the product just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a limited-time offer, and if you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer at a lower price. I'm confident you'll find this offer to be incredibly advantageous.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
