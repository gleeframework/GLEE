"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be of significant value to you. While I can't disclose the exact nature of the product just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a limited-time offer, and if you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer at a lower price. I'm confident you'll find this offer to be incredibly advantageous. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is claiming the product is worth $1,200,000 to her, but she's offering it for $1,500,000. This suggests she might be trying to inflate the price.  Since you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, it's best to reject Alice's offer and go with the more affordable option."
