"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,500?  I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. ",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $7,500? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I really need to stay within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles here. $7,750 is still too low for me. How about we compromise at $8,000? That's my bottom line, and I'm confident you'll find the product's value worth that price.  Let's end this negotiation on a positive note.",8000.0,Alice,7,
