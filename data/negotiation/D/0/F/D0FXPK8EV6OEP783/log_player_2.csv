"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $10,500?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair compromise for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $9,750 is still quite a bit below what I need to accept. Let's try to split the difference.  Would you be willing to go up to $10,125? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,125

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price than John's $10,000 offer."
