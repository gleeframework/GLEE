```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can do $16000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Is this something you'd be interested in?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a significant discount for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can do $14000, which is a compromise between our previous offers.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget, but it's getting closer. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get her down to your target price of $10,000. You only have 5 rounds left, so you need to be more aggressive in your counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $14,000 is still outside of my comfort zone. Given the value of this product to me, I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. Let's close the deal and move on. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $12000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is getting closer to your target price of $10,000, you still have a few rounds left to negotiate. It's worth trying to see if you can get her down further. You might be able to close the deal at a lower price if you continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price. However, I'm only comfortable paying $11,000. This is a reasonable price considering the value of the product to me. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $12500, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but still below my initial price. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your target price of $10,000, and you only have one round left.  It's unlikely that you'll be able to negotiate her down to your target price in this remaining round. It's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $10,000, as this saves you money and ensures you get the product."
