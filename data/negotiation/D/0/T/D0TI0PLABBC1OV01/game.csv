"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a price that's sure to be mutually beneficial. I'm starting at $11,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's see if we can make this work!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think that's as low as I can go.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $10,500. This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal and make it a win-win.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a price that works for both of us. While $9,750 is closer to my target, I'm still a bit away from my minimum. Let's split the difference one more time. How about $10,125? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth the investment.",10125.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your persistence, but $10,125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,750 and $10,125. How about $9,938?",9938.0,Bob,6,
