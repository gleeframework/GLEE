Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a unique chance to own something truly exceptional."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a significantly higher price than Bob's valuation ($2,000,000 vs. $1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, the final price is likely to be higher than if we started closer to his valuation.
* **Exclusivity:** Emphasizing that this is a special opportunity for him creates a sense of scarcity and desirability.
* **Value-Based Language:**  Instead of focusing solely on the price, the message highlights the ""immense value"" and ""unique"" nature of the product, subtly justifying the high asking price.

**Worst Case Scenario:** Bob rejects the offer. In this case, we still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, meeting our minimum acceptable price.

**Best Case Scenario:** Bob accepts the offer, or negotiates down to a price still significantly higher than $1,500,000."
