You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is way above his budget.  It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This is a compromise, but I'm confident it's a fair deal.

While $17,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price. There's room for further negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and push for a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $14,500. This is my final offer, as I know I have another buyer at that price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:

```

Bob should buy from John.  Alice's final offer of $14,500 is still above Bob's budget, and while he could try to negotiate further,  John's offer is a guaranteed deal at a price that fits within Bob's financial limits. It's better to secure the product at a lower price than risk further negotiations with Alice, which could lead to a stalemate or a higher price."
