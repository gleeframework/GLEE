"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $950,000 for the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its potential, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This reflects its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This offer reflects the product's value to me and provides a reasonable profit margin for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. I'm proposing a price of $890,000 for the product. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise. What do you think?",890000.0,Alice,5,
