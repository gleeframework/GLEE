"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $950,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to start the counter-offer process and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its potential, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This reflects its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial proposal, I can still potentially get a better price. I'm closer to my target of $800,000. Rejecting her offer allows me to continue negotiating and hopefully find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This offer reflects the product's value to me and provides a reasonable profit margin for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. I'm proposing a price of $890,000 for the product. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my target price.  At $890,000, I'm getting a good deal and saving a significant amount compared to buying from John.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible or that I'll run out of rounds. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price within my budget."
