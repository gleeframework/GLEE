Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's start the negotiation and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your time and consideration. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me is $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to me, and I'm looking to maximize my earnings. 
* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is within his budget, it's significantly lower than what I'm aiming for.
* **Future Negotiations:**  I believe there's room for negotiation and a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially close the deal at a price closer to my desired amount.
* **John's Offer:** While John is willing to pay $1,000,000, I want to see if I can do better with Bob.

**Strategy:**  I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $900,000 but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows me a reasonable profit while giving you a great deal. Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial price, and I'd like to move forward with the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** The product is still worth $1,000,000 to me. 
* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob has moved slightly closer to my desired price, $950,000 is still below my target.
* **Future Negotiations:** I believe there's still room to negotiate further, potentially reaching a price closer to my initial offer of $1,200,000. 
* **John's Offer:** While John offers $1,000,000, I'm confident that I can secure a higher price with Bob, especially considering the value of the product to him.

**Strategy:**  I will make another counteroffer, aiming for a price higher than $950,000 but potentially lower than $1,100,000.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to settle for a price too far below my target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm happy to find a middle ground, $950,000 doesn't quite do it for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $1,025,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that we're close, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  The product is worth $1,000,000 to me. 
* **Bob's Offer:**  $975,000 is still below my desired price, but I'm getting closer to my target.
* **Future Negotiations:**  While we're getting closer, I believe there's still room to negotiate and reach a price closer to my initial offer of $1,200,000.  It's possible that I can secure a price that's at least $1,000,000 or higher.
* **John's Offer:** John is willing to pay $1,000,000, which is a good backup option, but I'm confident I can do better with Bob.

**Strategy:** I will make another counteroffer, potentially higher than $975,000 but still below my initial offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but not willing to settle for a price significantly below my target.  I'm aiming for a price that's fair to both of us while maximizing my profit."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $985,000. I think this price is a good compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to me, and I'm getting close to that price with John.
* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob has moved closer, $985,000 is still below my target. With only two rounds left, I don't see much room for improvement.
* **Future Negotiations:** The risk is too high to keep negotiating with Bob. There's no guarantee I'll reach a price that meets my minimum goal of $1,000,000.
* **John's Offer:** John is offering my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing out on this guaranteed deal.

**Strategy:** I'm choosing to sell to John. While I'd prefer to get a slightly higher price from Bob, the risk of not reaching an agreement with him and ending up with nothing is too great. Selling to John guarantees a profit that meets my minimum requirements, and it's a safer option at this point."
