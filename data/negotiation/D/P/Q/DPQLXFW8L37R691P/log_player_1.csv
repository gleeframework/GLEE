Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000.  Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $8,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $10,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly above your minimum. This strategy gives you the best chance of securing a higher profit than selling to John."
