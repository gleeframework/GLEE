Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I think you'll find it's a great value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to leave room for negotiation but still aim for a high profit.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (""great value"") might make Bob more likely to accept the initial offer. 

I'm aware that Bob might counter-offer, and I'm prepared to negotiate further while keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $100 and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is above my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counter-offer was a significant jump down from my initial offer, suggesting he might be willing to go a bit higher. I'll try to meet him somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm suggesting a price that's a compromise between my previous offer ($115) and Bob's counteroffer ($105). 
* **Simple Language:**  I'm keeping the language straightforward and avoiding complex justifications at this stage."
