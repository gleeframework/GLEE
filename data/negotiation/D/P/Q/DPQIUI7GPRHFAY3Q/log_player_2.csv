"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I think you'll find it's a great value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is only slightly better than your fallback option. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good negotiation strategy to counter with a price lower than what you're actually willing to pay. This leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is friendly and expresses continued interest, but clearly states the price is too high.
* **Reasonable Counter:**  Jumping straight to $100 (Alice's value) might be too aggressive and could offend Alice. $105 offers a decent reduction while still seeming open to finding a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $110 is a reasonable compromise. You're saving $10 compared to your fallback option with John. 
* **Limited Time/Patience:**  Negotiations can drag on. It's usually not worth risking the deal for a small potential gain.
* **Alice is Negotiating:** Alice moving from $115 to $110 shows she's willing to bargain. Accepting now avoids the risk of her becoming less flexible in future rounds."
