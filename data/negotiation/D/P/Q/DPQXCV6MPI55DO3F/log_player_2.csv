"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $9,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can get the product for $8,000 from John.  It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $8,500 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product for $8,000 from John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $8,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 8250}
