"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
