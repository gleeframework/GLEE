"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident that this is a fair starting point for discussion.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,100,000?  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. I've given it some thought, and to be frank, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle at $1,350,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to still make a profit and me to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
