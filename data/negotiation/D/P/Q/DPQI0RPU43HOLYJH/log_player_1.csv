"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident that this is a fair starting point for discussion."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room to negotiate and creates the impression that the product is highly valued. 
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in the offer can subtly influence Bob's perception of the product's worth.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The phrase ""starting point for discussion"" signals that you're open to negotiation without immediately undervaluing your product.

This strategy aims to:

* Gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate.
* Potentially secure a price closer to your desired outcome.
* Set the stage for a mutually beneficial deal, while keeping your alternative option with John in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,100,000?  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's good to know he's interested, accepting now would mean a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially with John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. I've given it some thought, and to be frank, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway – how about we settle at $1,350,000?  This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Counter:**  It's important to show Bob his offer was heard and considered, even if it's below my target.
* **Justifying the Rejection:** A brief, honest reason for declining his offer makes the negotiation more transparent.
* **Significant but Gradual Concession:** By dropping $150,000, I demonstrate a willingness to negotiate but still hold a strong position.
* **New Target Price:**  The $1,350,000 price point aims for a win-win – a significant profit above my minimum while leaving room for Bob to potentially negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to still make a profit and me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 meets my absolute minimum acceptable price. While I initially aimed for a higher profit, accepting this offer guarantees I don't lose money and avoids the risk of further negotiation or Bob walking away. It's a solid deal, and I'm happy to close it now."
