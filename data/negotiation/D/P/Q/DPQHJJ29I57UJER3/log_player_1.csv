"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate but not that far down. I'll counter-offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $12,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. Let's split the difference. I'll offer you the product for $16,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to counter-offer again in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $15,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to be flexible, but $14,000 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,500? This would give you a great deal while still allowing me to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough.  I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's too low.  I'll take Jhon's offer and move on."
