Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $130 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You've stated your minimum value is $100, so this price is above that.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's room for a compromise.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  Starting with a very high price could scare Bob off. 

This strategy allows you to potentially get a higher price while still leaving room for a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $130 is a bit more than I'd like to spend right now.  I'm willing to pay $110 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is lower than your desired price, but it's still better than selling to John. You should reject Bob's offer and proceed with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
