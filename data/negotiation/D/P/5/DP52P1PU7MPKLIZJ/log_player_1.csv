I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a good starting point because it's a bit higher than my minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to make a counteroffer.  I'm confident that I can get at least $11,000 from Bob, and if not, I can always sell to John for $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering with $11,200. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer.  I hope to meet somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's only $100 less than my minimum acceptable price, I still think there's room for negotiation.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering with $11,000.  This is my final offer before I'll accept Bob's offer or sell to John.  I'm hoping to get close to my target price, but I'm prepared to settle for $10,900 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  It's not my ideal price, but it's above my minimum and it's better than selling to John. It's likely that if I reject this offer, Bob will either walk away or offer a lower price, which wouldn't be in my best interest."
