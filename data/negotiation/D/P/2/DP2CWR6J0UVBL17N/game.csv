"Bob, I'm excited about the potential of this product for you. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your company.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,400,000, reflecting its quality and potential. I believe this price is fair for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in this product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  How about we settle at $1,100,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects its worth to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  However, $1,100,000 doesn't come close to the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price.  How about we settle on $1,300,000? This price still allows for a good return for me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price point closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $1,150,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
