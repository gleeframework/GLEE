"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $9000 is a good price, it doesn't reflect the true value of the product.  I'm willing to go down to $10500.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's the best I can do at this point. Let's try to find some common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
