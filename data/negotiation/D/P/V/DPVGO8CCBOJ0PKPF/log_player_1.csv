"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, hoping to secure a good price quickly.  I'm leaving some room for negotiation, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a higher price.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $10,750. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm trying to find a middle ground that's still profitable for me but might be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now the same as his previous offer, and I'm starting to run out of time. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent price for the product, and it's better than selling to John for a lower price."
