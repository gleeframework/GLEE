"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth that much to you.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice is right that the product is worth $10,000 to me, her offer doesn't save me any money. I can achieve the same result by buying from John.  I'll try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
