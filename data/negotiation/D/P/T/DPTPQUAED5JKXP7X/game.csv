,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $850000 is slightly above my budget. I'm ready to pay $750000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm still making a fair profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $820000.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. However, $820000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $780000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the product's value and my budget constraints.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",780000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer you a slight discount, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $810000. This is a compromise that should work for both of us, considering the product's value and your budget constraints.",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility in the negotiations.  $810000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $790000, which is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial limitations. I believe this is a good compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal.",790000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession to seal the deal. I can offer you the product for $805000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and your budget constraints.",805000.0,Alice,7,
