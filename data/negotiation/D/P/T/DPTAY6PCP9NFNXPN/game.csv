"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm firm on my offer of $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer of $10,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,500. This is as low as I can go. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm confident that we can find a solution that works for both of us. My final offer is $10,000.  Let's make this deal happen.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I've already made a significant concession, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and your offer, which is $10,250. This is my final counteroffer. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,7,
