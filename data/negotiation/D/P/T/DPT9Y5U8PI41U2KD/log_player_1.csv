Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a backup buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Negotiation Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's closer to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation while ensuring the deal is still attractive enough for him to accept.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can be a real asset. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000, which reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1350000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:** The message is clear and highlights the product's value to Bob.
* **Strong Starting Point:**  $1,350,000  leaves room for negotiation but anchors the price significantly closer to Bob's valuation than your minimum.
* **Justification:**  Phrases like ""true worth"" subtly imply the price is fair and well-considered.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob tends to negotiate aggressively, you might start slightly higher than $1,350,000.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, a less aggressive starting price might be preferable. 

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how much you're willing to negotiate."
