Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to you than that. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value to Bob, potentially making him more willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save a bit more. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle yet. There's still room to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. This price still allows you to get a great deal on the product, and it's a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,000. How about we meet at $9,250? I'm willing to make a bit of a concession, but I'd like to stay within my budget. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $9,250 is still a good deal for me, especially considering John's offer. It's getting closer to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
