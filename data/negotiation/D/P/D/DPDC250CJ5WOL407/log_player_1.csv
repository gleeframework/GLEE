""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully.  Please let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,450,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit, but still keeps the price significantly above your minimum.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer"") might encourage Bob to accept without trying to haggle too much. 

**Why not higher?**

* Going too close to $1,500,000 might make Bob balk, especially since he knows you have another buyer. It's a balance between ambition and realism."
