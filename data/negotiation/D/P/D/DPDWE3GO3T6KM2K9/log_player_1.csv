"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer is at the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'll choose option 1.
