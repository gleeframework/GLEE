I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for anything less than my minimum price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but still below my initial asking price. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below it.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
