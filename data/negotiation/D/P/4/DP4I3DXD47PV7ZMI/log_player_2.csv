"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $17,000 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

Bob should start by making the lowest offer possible within his budget.  This establishes his firm price point and lets Alice know he's serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $15,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  He should continue negotiating for a lower price. There are still rounds left to reach a deal that works for both of them."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

Bob should increase his offer slightly to $13,000. This shows Alice he's willing to compromise while staying within his budget. It's a reasonable middle ground that may be more appealing to Alice than his initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, he should still try to negotiate a lower price. There are still rounds left and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise. Bob should aim to get a price closer to his $12,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

Bob should increase his offer again, but only slightly to $13,500. This shows Alice he's serious about reaching a deal, but also that he's not willing to go much higher than his initial offer. It also leaves some room for a compromise that might be acceptable to both parties."
