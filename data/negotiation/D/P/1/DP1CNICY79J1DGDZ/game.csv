"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $130 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $115, which is a great compromise. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concern, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I can do $112, which is close to your offer. It's a good compromise, and I think we're getting close to a deal. What do you think?",112.0,Alice,5,
