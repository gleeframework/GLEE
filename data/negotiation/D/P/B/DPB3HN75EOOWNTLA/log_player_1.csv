"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it!  I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $115, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm starting with a positive and friendly message to build rapport. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By starting at $115, I have some space to go down if needed while still aiming for a profit higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still determined to get a better deal. 
* **I have room to negotiate.**  I have 8 more rounds to work with, so I'm not in a rush to accept a low offer.
* **John is a backup option.** Knowing I can sell to John for $120 gives me confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $110?  That's a good price for both of us and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but still maintain a profit:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price that's profitable for me.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  I'm reminding Bob that this price is good for both of us, keeping the negotiation friendly.
* **No need to rush:**  With John as a backup, I can be patient and see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference at $107.50. If you're not willing to go that low, I'm going to have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $107.50 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Bob is threatening to ""consider other options,"" which suggests he might walk away.
* **Time is running out:** I'm already in round 4, and with only 6 rounds remaining, I need to be cautious about holding out for too much longer. 

While I'd prefer to get closer to $110, it's likely that Bob won't budge much further. Accepting his offer ensures I secure a sale and get a profit, albeit a smaller one than I initially hoped for."
