"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
 
**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good idea to start negotiations a bit higher than your desired selling point. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Close to Bob's Value:**  Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, starting at $110 is close enough to his perceived value that he'll likely be interested while still giving me room to negotiate. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will also help gauge how eager Bob is to buy the product. His response will give me valuable information for the rest of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $90 is a decent price, it's still significantly lower than my target and closer to my minimum. Bob's initial offer suggests he's aiming for a price well below his perceived value.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are still 8 rounds left, providing ample opportunity to negotiate a better price. Rejecting Bob's offer signals that I'm willing to negotiate but not at any price. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $80 provides a safety net. I don't need to accept an offer below that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By countering, I demonstrate that I'm willing to negotiate and find a compromise. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Suggesting $100 is a classic negotiation tactic. It positions the offer as a fair compromise, even though it's still closer to my initial asking price.
* **Maintaining Value:** This counteroffer keeps the price well above my minimum and closer to Bob's perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob is moving very slowly in his offers. While $92.50 is better, it's only a slight increase from his last offer, suggesting he has more room to move.
* **Time is Valuable:** With each passing round, the potential profit decreases. I need to encourage Bob to make more significant jumps in his offers.
* **Alternative Option:** The option to sell to John for $80 provides a solid fallback. I don't feel pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit too far off for me.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $98? This feels like a reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 98}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I want to convey that I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to give the product away. By stating $92.50 is ""too far off,"" I reinforce my position.
* **Strategic Concession:**  Coming down to $98 shows flexibility on my part but is still a relatively small concession. This keeps the pressure on Bob to make a more significant move.
* **Time Constraint:** With fewer rounds remaining, I'm starting to apply more pressure. Highlighting the need for a ""reasonable compromise"" subtly reminds Bob that time is of the essence."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm still a bit short on budget, so I was thinking $95 would be a sweet spot for me. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Offer:** $95 is a reasonable price and a significant profit above my minimum. 
* **Limited Upside:** While I could potentially negotiate a bit more in the remaining rounds, Bob's increases have been incremental. It's unlikely he'll suddenly jump to $100 or higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing the negotiation carries the risk that Bob will walk away or I'll be forced to accept a lower offer as time runs out. Accepting $95 now secures a good profit. 
* **""Bird in Hand"" Principle:** It's often better to accept a good offer now than to risk losing it by holding out for a potentially slightly better offer later."
