"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000 for the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $9,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer you a price of $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
