"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $780,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for both of us to make a profit. Let me know what you think.",780000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I have to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $780,000. I'm now offering the product to you for $820,000. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $820,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and it's the absolute maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I've already had a confirmed offer from John to buy the product for $800,000, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to sell it to you for $810,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",810000.0,Alice,5,
