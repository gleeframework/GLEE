Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This gives me room to negotiate and gauge Bob's interest.  I'm confident I can get at least $1,500,000 from John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can get more.  I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,900,000. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this will bring us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum threshold of $1,500,000.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob completely and being forced to settle with John. It's better to secure a sale now."
