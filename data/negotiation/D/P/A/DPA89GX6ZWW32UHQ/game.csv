"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something I've carefully curated and it's worth at least $10,000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows me a small profit.  Let me know your thoughts!",11000.0,Alice,1,
