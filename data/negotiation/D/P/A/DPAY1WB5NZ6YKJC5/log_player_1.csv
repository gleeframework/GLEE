Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $160 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Personalization:** I'm adding a friendly message to make Bob feel valued and more likely to engage.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm asking an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I can likely secure a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is a safe option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:** I'm explaining my reasoning for the counteroffer, making it seem more fair and reasonable.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone friendly to maintain a good rapport with Bob."
