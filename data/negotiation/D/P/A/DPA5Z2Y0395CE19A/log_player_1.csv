Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to your maximum.
* **Appear Reasonable:**  While you know John will pay $12,000, starting too high with Bob might make him lose interest entirely.  $11,500 positions the offer as a potential win-win."
