# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

You can get the product from John for $10,000, which is less than Alice's offer of $11,500.  It's always better to save money if possible!"
