"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10000 for it. Would you be able to meet me at this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $10000. How about we meet in the middle at $11500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10750. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions. I hope this meets your needs.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $10750 is still quite a bit below what I need to accept. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $11250. This is a final offer from my end. Let me know if you're interested.",11250.0,Alice,5,
