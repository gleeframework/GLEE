"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's worth $120 to you, and I believe we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. Let me start by offering it to you for $110. I hope this price aligns with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $110 is too high. While it's a good starting point, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
