"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a fair and competitive offer of $12,000. This is a great value considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $9,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to go down to $8,200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?

It's not worth going back and forth with Alice anymore. She's unlikely to go below $8,000, and John is offering the product at that price right now. It's time to cut my losses and secure the deal with John."
