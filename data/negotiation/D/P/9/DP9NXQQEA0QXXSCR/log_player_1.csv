Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($120) without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little, while still ensuring a good profit for Alice.
* **Avoid Extremes:** Offering it at $120 is unlikely to work, as Bob has no incentive to accept. Offering it at $80 leaves potential profit on the table. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob is likely to accept the offer."
