"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value is worth $1,200,000 to you, I'm willing to offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further negotiations. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to find a good deal, and I'm always open to negotiation. However, $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,025,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver substantial value.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Alice. However, I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Considering your initial offer was $1,100,000 and you're now asking for $1,025,000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,012,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",1012500.0,Bob,4,
