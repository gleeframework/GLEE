"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,100,000?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than what John would charge and still allows Bob to save $100,000 compared to Alice's initial offer.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away or needing to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
