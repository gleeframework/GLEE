"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial valuation, you're aiming for a lower price. There's room to negotiate, and you can potentially get a better deal by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $11,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to come down that far. How about $11,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a little more flexibility. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your target of $10,000. You're still better off rejecting the offer and seeing if you can negotiate further. There's a possibility that Alice might be willing to come down further, especially since you've already shown a willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  This gives us both some wiggle room, and I'm confident this is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. How about $10,900? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to meet in the middle. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,900 is closer to your target than Alice's previous offers, it's still above your $10,000 limit. At this point, you've already spent 4 rounds negotiating, and there's a risk that Alice might not be willing to come down any further.  

Buying from John guarantees you the product at your desired price point. It's the safest and most efficient option to secure the product within your budget."
