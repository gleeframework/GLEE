"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $18,000, which is higher than the product's worth to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message highlights the value of the product and emphasizes a good deal for Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear I'm open to negotiation, allowing for potential counteroffers. 
* **Leaving Room for John:**  While I'm aiming for the best price, I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low. I have the option of selling to John for $15,000, so I can set a reasonable floor for my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can come to a more mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to pay $14,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $14,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, which is better than accepting Bob's current offer. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $16,000,  which is still a fair price considering its worth to me. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $18,000 to $16,000, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to me, justifying my counteroffer.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** The message encourages Bob to see $16,000 as a reasonable midpoint, increasing the chances of a deal.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $16,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring I don't sell myself short."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I would like to propose a price closer to my budget. I am willing to pay $15,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No need for further negotiation:** There's no guarantee I can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Secure Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale without the risk of further negotiation or potential rejection. 
* **Equal to John's offer:**  Since John is also offering $15,000, I have no reason to risk losing the deal with Bob by continuing negotiations."
