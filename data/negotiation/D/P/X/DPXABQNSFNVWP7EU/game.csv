"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100 for it. Would that work for you?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm thinking more along the lines of $140. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $140 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's the absolute maximum I can do.",120.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $120. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet at $130? It's still a good price for the product, and I think it's worth it.",130.0,Alice,5,
