"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Given its potential, I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the $900,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to encourage a deal. How about we settle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we settle at $975,000? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget.",975000.0,Bob,4,
