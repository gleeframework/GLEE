"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $17,500. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's make this deal happen.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go up to $15,500. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. I'm not getting any younger, and I'd like to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",16000.0,Alice,5,
