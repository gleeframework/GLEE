Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob has room to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's a good price for Bob:** It allows Bob to get the product for less than its value to him. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is above your minimum, it's still worth trying to get a bit more.  Since Bob is willing to pay more than John, let's see if we can push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit closer to my original asking price.  Would you consider $9,250?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a good outcome."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

This counteroffer is a good move for these reasons:

* **It's still within Bob's range:**  $9,250 is less than the product's value to Bob, making it a good deal for him.
* **It's a reasonable compromise:** This price is a midpoint between your original offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to meet in the middle.
* **It shows you're firm but flexible:** You're not giving in to Bob's initial offer, but you're also not being unreasonable. 

Let's see if this counteroffer gets you closer to your goal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your original offer. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is a good deal. It's higher than what John would pay and only slightly lower than your last counteroffer. Accepting it allows you to secure a good price and close the deal without risking further negotiation."
