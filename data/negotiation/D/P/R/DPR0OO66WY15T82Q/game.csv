"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it, considering its value to me. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $9,500 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,800, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the fact that I'm ready to close the deal. Let me know what you think.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad to see you're serious about closing the deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,800. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $10,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
