**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning another potential buyer (John) creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 
* **Justifying the Price:** Highlighting the product's value and anticipated demand provides a rationale for the high asking price. 

By offering the product at $12,000, Alice aims to:

1.  **Maximize Profit:** If Bob accepts, Alice gains a significant profit beyond her minimum.
2.  **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob negotiates down, Alice has a strong chance of selling the product for more than $10,000.
3. **Maintain Backup Option:**  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can still sell to John at her minimum acceptable price."
