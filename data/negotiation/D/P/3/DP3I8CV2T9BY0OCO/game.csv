"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this fantastic product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $15,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $14,000. Would you be open to $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but I'm still not comfortable going below $15,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $14,800. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",14800.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for sticking with this negotiation. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we land right in the middle at $14,400?  That feels like a fair deal to me.",14400.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're still talking. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,400. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,800 and $14,400, which would be $14,600. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",14600.0,Alice,7,
