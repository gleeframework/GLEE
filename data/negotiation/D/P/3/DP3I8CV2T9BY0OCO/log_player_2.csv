Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're still talking. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14,400. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,800 and $14,400, which would be $14,600. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly very firm on her price, and while I could try to push for a slightly better deal, it's unlikely I'll get much lower. Accepting $14,600 secures the product at a price significantly under my $15,000 limit, which is a good outcome."
