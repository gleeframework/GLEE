"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider a price of $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $925,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $737,500?",737500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your desire to meet in the middle, the value of this product is significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $862,500.  This offer reflects a considerable compromise on my end.",862500.0,Alice,5,
