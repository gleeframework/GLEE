Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $150. I believe it offers significant value, even at that price."", ""product_price"": 150} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired price, leaving room for negotiation. This also helps gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price (even if vague about ""value"") can make it seem less arbitrary. 
* **Leaving Room:** While $150 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it allows for counteroffers and movement towards a price acceptable to both parties, or you can move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $80 is far below your minimum acceptable price. While he stated it's his maximum, there's potential for negotiation. You'll counter-offer to see if you can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $80 is too low for me.  I could consider letting it go for $130.  This is a very fair offer considering its quality and value."", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:** This counter-offer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while staying well above your $120 minimum.  
* **Holding Firm (For Now):** While we came down in price, the message still emphasizes the product's value to justify the higher price point. We'll see if Bob budges or if further concessions are needed. 
* **Alternative is Still Viable:** Remember, John offers a guaranteed $120.  If Bob doesn't budge much in the next round, it might be time to move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Close Enough:** While not ideal, $110 is above your absolute minimum price of $120 and only slightly less than John's offer. 
* **Saves Time and Potential Hassle:** Accepting now secures a reasonable profit and avoids further back-and-forth, which may not yield a significantly better outcome. 
* **""Maximum"" Likely Means Business:** Bob has now stated his ""maximum"" twice. While it's possible he could go a little higher, it's unlikely to be significant enough to warrant the risk of losing the sale."
