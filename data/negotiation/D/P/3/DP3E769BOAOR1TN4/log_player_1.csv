Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price is fair considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested. "", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000:** This price is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's maximum value but lower than my minimum value.  It gives Bob a chance to make a profit while ensuring I still earn a significant amount. 
* **The message:**  It's friendly and emphasizes the potential benefits for Bob. This approach aims to make him more receptive to the offer. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximizes profit:** This strategy gives me the best chance of getting the highest price possible while still ensuring I don't lose money compared to selling to John.
* **Negotiation potential:** Leaving room for negotiation (between $800,000 and $900,000) could lead to a successful deal. 
* **Minimizes risk:** By having a backup buyer (John) at a higher price, I don't have to accept anything less than $900,000."
