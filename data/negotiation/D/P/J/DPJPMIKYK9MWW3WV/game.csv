"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $900000 is simply too low for me to consider.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1500000.  This reflects the value I place on the product while still leaving room for you to negotiate. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
