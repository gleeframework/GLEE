# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, and we're looking to maximize our earnings. Let's start with an offer of $140. We believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  It's above my maximum budget of $150.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  There's room for a lower price, as the product is worth $120 to Alice.
* **Goal is to save money:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product, but $140 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $130.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a mutually beneficial solution. Considering your willingness to pay $130, I am proposing a price of $135 for our product. This still allows us to earn a reasonable profit while being mindful of your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within my budget:**  $135 is less than my maximum of $150.
* **Potential for further negotiation exists:** While I'd prefer a lower price, accepting this offer saves me $15 compared to buying from John.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the product altogether or running out of rounds."
