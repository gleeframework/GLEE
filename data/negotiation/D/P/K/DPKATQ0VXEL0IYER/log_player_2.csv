Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While $1200000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1700000. This price still allows me to profit and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the potential of the product. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. While $1400000 is still a bit below my minimum, I'm willing to go down to $1550000. This would give you a great deal on the product, and it would allow me to cover my costs.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal at this price.
