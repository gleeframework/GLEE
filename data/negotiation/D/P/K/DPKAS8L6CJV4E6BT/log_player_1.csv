Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $150 allows room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value might even be higher than $150, potentially justifying the price in Bob's mind.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy.  You could experiment with different opening offers and messages to see what works best."
