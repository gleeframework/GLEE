I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $100?,100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a little steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $85 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Would you be willing to meet me at $95?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $95 is closer to what I had in mind. How about we settle in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $98. Would you be willing to meet me there?",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  To be honest, anything over $95 and I'd be better off going with a different seller.  Would you be willing to do $93, as my final offer?",93.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $93. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $93, which would be $94. Would you be willing to accept that?",94.0,Alice,7,
