"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Alice's willingness to move on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice moved down $1,000 from her initial offer, showing some flexibility. However, there's still room for negotiation before reaching our $10,000 target (or getting close enough to warrant a deal). We'll counteroffer again and see how she responds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're proposing a price that's exactly halfway between our last offer and her current offer. This shows willingness to compromise while still moving towards a price point that's favorable for us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11,500 is still a bit lower than what I need.  Let's split the difference. How about $12,500?  This would be a great deal for you and would allow me to sell the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to a price we might accept, but we still have room to negotiate. We'll counter with a price slightly below her offer to see if we can get closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer! I'd be willing to do $12,100. That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're nudging the price down incrementally, demonstrating that we're willing to pay a bit more, but still aiming for a price below $12,500. This keeps the negotiation moving while maintaining pressure on Alice to come down further."
