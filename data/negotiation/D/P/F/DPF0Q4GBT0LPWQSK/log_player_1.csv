Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It is significantly higher than your minimum price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 

Here's why this is a good starting point:

* **Higher than your minimum:** This ensures you're making a profit and still leaving room for potential concessions.
* **Lower than Bob's maximum:** This gives Bob a good incentive to accept the offer, knowing he's getting a good deal. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  By not starting with a ""final"" price, you allow for both you and Bob to move closer to a mutually agreeable price. 

Remember, you can always adjust this offer based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $8500?  This is a fair price for both of us, considering your value for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your initial offer, aiming for a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  How about $9,000? This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - $8750.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is a good compromise.  While it's still below your initial goal, it's higher than your floor price and a good way to secure a deal. It's also important to consider that you could continue to negotiate, but there's no guarantee that Bob will continue to budge.  This is a good place to close the deal."
