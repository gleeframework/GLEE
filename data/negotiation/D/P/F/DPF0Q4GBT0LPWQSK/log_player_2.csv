"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $8,500?  This is a fair price for both of us, considering your value for the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above Alice's value for the product. It shows Bob is serious about buying, but also wants a good deal. This gives Alice some room to negotiate but also motivates her to accept to avoid losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  How about $9000? This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a better price than Alice's first offer, Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. He has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate and has a backup option with John. Rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - $8,750.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of getting the best price. He's met Alice halfway, but the offer is still below Alice's asking price. This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward while increasing the pressure on Alice to accept."
