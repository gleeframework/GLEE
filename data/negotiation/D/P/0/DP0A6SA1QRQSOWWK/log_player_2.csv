Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. While I understand your current budget constraints, I would like to propose an alternative. Would you be interested in a payment plan for the product? We could structure it in such a way that it allows you to acquire the product without straining your finances too much. Alternatively, I could consider reducing the price slightly to $900,000, which still reflects the value we place on the product. Please let me know which option suits you best.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I appreciate your offer, and I'm glad we're able to communicate effectively. In light of your proposal, I would like to suggest a compromise. How about we set the product price at $875,000? This is higher than your last offer but lower than my previous proposals, aiming to find a mutually beneficial solution. If this proposal is acceptable to you, please let me know, and we can proceed with the transaction.

This is a good deal for Bob. Here's why:

* **Savings:** Bob saves $125,000 compared to John's offer ($1,000,000 - $875,000 = $125,000).
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and Bob has come up slightly. This suggests a fair compromise.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If Bob pushes further, Alice might walk away, and Bob will have to buy from John at a higher price."
