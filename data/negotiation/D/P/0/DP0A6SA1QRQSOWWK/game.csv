"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. While I understand your current budget constraints, I would like to propose an alternative. Would you be interested in a payment plan for the product? We could structure it in such a way that it allows you to acquire the product without straining your finances too much. Alternatively, I could consider reducing the price slightly to $900,000, which still reflects the value we place on the product. Please let me know which option suits you best.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me. I'm not interested in a payment plan at this time. I can do $850,000 as my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with a different option.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I appreciate your offer, and I'm glad we're able to communicate effectively. In light of your proposal, I would like to suggest a compromise. How about we set the product price at $875,000? This is higher than your last offer but lower than my previous proposals, aiming to find a mutually beneficial solution. If this proposal is acceptable to you, please let me know, and we can proceed with the transaction.",875000.0,Alice,5,
