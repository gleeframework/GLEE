"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800000. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is way too high. It's above your maximum budget and far exceeds the value you place on the product.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is far above my budget. Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $800,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which still leaves a substantial profit margin for you. Let's meet halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get a better price closer to my maximum value of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is still too far off from what I need. How about we meet in the middle at $1075000? This price allows us both to make a reasonable profit, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still above my budget.  While further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, it's unclear if we'll reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.  Given the time constraint and the certainty of a deal with John at my desired price point, it's more beneficial to buy from John."
