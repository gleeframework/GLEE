Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is far above my budget. Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $800000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, so I'm not willing to sell it for $800,000. I'll try to negotiate with Bob to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still leaves a substantial profit margin for you. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1200000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll keep John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too far off from what I need. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This price allows us both to make a reasonable profit, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1075000}
