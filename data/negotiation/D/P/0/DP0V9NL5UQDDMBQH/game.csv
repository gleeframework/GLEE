"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800000. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is far above my budget. Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $800000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which still leaves a substantial profit margin for you. Let's meet halfway.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1200000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is still too far off from what I need. How about we meet in the middle at $1075000? This price allows us both to make a reasonable profit, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. ",1075000.0,Alice,5,
