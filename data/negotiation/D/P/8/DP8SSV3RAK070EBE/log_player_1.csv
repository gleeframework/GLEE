I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a profit.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $75. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a compromise."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $78. Can you consider it?

You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $78 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a price that's more agreeable for both of us."
