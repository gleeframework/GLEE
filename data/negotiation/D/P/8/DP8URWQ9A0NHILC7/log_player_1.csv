I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $125 is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $140. I'll make another counteroffer to Bob."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. It's a bit lower than what I originally hoped for, but it's still a good deal. It's more than I'd get from John and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go any higher."
