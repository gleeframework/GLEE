"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you and a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is above Bob's value but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I'm still making a profit.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the benefit for Bob while stating my position clearly. 

This is a good starting point for the negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a little too high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $65 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'm trying to maximize my profit, I'm not desperate to sell at this low price. 

I'm rejecting his offer and proceeding to the next round to see if we can reach a more agreeable price. I'm also keeping in mind the option to sell to John for $120, which is a guaranteed profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering $85, which is still above Bob's value but significantly closer to my minimum.  
* **Message:** I'm remaining polite and acknowledging Bob's offer while stating my position firmly.  I'm also emphasizing the ""good deal"" for Bob to encourage him to accept. 

This counteroffer is a good compromise and gives Bob a chance to reconsider without me having to drop to a price that's unacceptable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $75?  That's a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I'm not desperate to sell quickly, and I want to see if we can push a bit higher. I'm confident that with some more negotiation, we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm also mindful of my fallback option: selling to John for $120, which is still a very good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. But $75 is still a bit low for me. How about $80? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $80, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. 
* **Message:** I'm remaining positive and emphasizing the win-win situation, while making it clear that I'm not willing to go lower than $80.

I believe this offer is a good balance between staying firm on my price and showing willingness to compromise. Let's see if Bob takes it."
