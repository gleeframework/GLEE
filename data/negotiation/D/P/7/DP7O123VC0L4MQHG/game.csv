"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a little too high for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $75?  That's a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away happy.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. But $75 is still a bit low for me. How about $80? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this deal happen!",80.0,Alice,5,
