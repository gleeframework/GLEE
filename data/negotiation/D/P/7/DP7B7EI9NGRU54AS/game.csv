"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price of $2,300,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the price you're proposing doesn't reflect the true value of this product and the potential benefits it offers.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. I believe this revised price is still fair and allows both of us to benefit.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. While I respect the value of the product, I must stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. This price reflects a compromise that I believe is reasonable for both parties.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
