"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting and making a counteroffer.  He knows the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $13,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, as it's well above your value for the product. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $13,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my original offer. How about $13,500? This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $15,000 to you.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is attractive:** Alice has lowered her price to $13,500, which is only $500 more than Bob's counteroffer. This is a significant move towards Bob's target price.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  While Bob could reject and counter again, there's a risk that Alice will stick to her offer or become less willing to negotiate further.  
* **John's offer is more expensive:**  Buying from John for $15,000 is significantly more expensive than accepting Alice's offer.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer at $13,500 is the best option for Bob, as it secures a good deal and avoids further negotiation that might not result in a better price."
