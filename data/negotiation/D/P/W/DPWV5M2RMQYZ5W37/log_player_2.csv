Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John. There's room to bargain."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $110 is a bit low, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

Alice is meeting me closer to my budget, and this price is a good deal compared to John's offer.  It's time to accept and avoid potentially losing the deal."
