,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1050000 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1050000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $1100000, which is a $100000 reduction from my initial offer. Let me know if that's more in line with your budget.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to pay $1075000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and it's closer to my budget. Let me know if you're open to it.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1075000. I can meet you halfway at $1087500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
