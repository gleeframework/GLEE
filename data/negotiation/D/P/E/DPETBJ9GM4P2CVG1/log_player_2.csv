"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still more than Bob's maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1050000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $1100000, which is a $100000 reduction from my initial offer. Let me know if that's more in line with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While Alice's offer is a compromise, it's still above what Bob wants to spend. There's still room for negotiation.  Since Bob can buy from John for $1,000,000, he doesn't need to accept anything above that."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to pay $1,075,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and it's closer to my budget. Let me know if you're open to it."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1075000. I can meet you halfway at $1087500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,087,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, Bob can secure the product for a lower price from John. There's no guarantee Alice will budge further, and continuing to negotiate risks wasting time.  Buying from John ensures a definite deal within Bob's budget."
