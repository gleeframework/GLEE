"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. How about $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your position, but $2,300,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I could consider $2,100,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's true value.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
