"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $850000 is slightly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $750000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $810000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and your budget.",810000.0,Alice,3,
