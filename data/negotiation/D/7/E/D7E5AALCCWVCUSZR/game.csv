"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1200000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer you $1000000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and provides a good return for you.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $1000000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1100000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $1050000. This is a good compromise, and allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1050000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1080000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
