"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's tempting to try to negotiate, it's always best to start with a firm stance.  Since you have a backup option with John, it's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if you can get a better price from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $1000000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still above your budget.  You have a guaranteed option to purchase from John at $1,000,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, but you have a strong position because you have another option."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1050000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1080000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,080,000 is still above your budget. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. While there's a chance you could potentially negotiate Alice down further, there's also a risk of losing the deal completely if you reject her offer and she decides to walk away.  It's best to take the guaranteed lower price from John."
