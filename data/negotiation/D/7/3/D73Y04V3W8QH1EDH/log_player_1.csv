"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $115, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to hopefully get Bob interested. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  I'm setting up a situation where Bob can feel like he's getting a good deal if he accepts my offer, while still allowing room for counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $85 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:**  While Bob's initial offer was rejected, there's still an opportunity to negotiate a better price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price in the following rounds. 
* **Selling to John is a Backup:**  While selling to John is a guaranteed $120, it's not the most ideal scenario as I'd prefer to maximize my profit if possible through negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105.  This price still gives you a good deal, and I'm hoping we can close this deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:**  $105 is a compromise that's still above my minimum acceptable price of $120 but also closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintain my desired profit margin.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging a deal.
* **Highlighting benefits:**  I'm emphasizing that the price still gives Bob a good deal to incentivize acceptance.
* **Clear call to action:**  I'm directly asking for Bob's response to encourage a quick decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  I'm getting closer, but $105 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for higher offer:** I believe there is still room for negotiation and I can likely get closer to my target price in the following rounds. 
* **Selling to John is still a backup:** While selling to John is a guaranteed $120, I'm hoping to maximize my profit with Bob if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price. I'm willing to go down to $100, which is still a good deal for both of us. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and pressure for Bob to accept.
* **Compromise:**  $100 is a further compromise from my previous offer and is closer to Bob's price. 
* **Mutual benefit:**  I'm highlighting the mutual benefit of the deal, suggesting it's a fair price for both of us.
* **Strong call to action:**  I'm directly asking for Bob's decision to encourage a quick response."
