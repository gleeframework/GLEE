``` 

**Explanation:**

Accepting Alice's offer is the best choice for Bob.  Here's why:

* **Cost Savings:** Buying from Alice saves Bob $50,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so even at $1,450,000, Bob is still getting a deal. 

While Bob could potentially try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's no guarantee she'd agree. Accepting the offer ensures he gets the product at a good price without the risk of losing it to John."
