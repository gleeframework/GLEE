"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm aiming to sell it for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than both my upper limit and John's price.  There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($10,000) than Alice's initial price ($20,000). This creates room for negotiation and signals that her initial price was unrealistic.
* **Leaving Room:** While I'm aiming for a price closer to $12,000, I don't want to start there. Offering $10,000 allows me to potentially negotiate up slightly while still staying well below my budget.
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:**  This counteroffer will help gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price. Her response will provide valuable information for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved from her initial price, $17,000 is still significantly higher than my $12,000 limit and considerably more expensive than buying from John. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Her willingness to negotiate suggests there's still room to bring the price down further. 
* **Strategic Counter-Offering:** By continuing to negotiate, I can try to get closer to my target price or gain a better understanding of Alice's lowest acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $17,000 is still a bit steep for my budget, however. Would you consider $13,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm moving closer to Alice's price to demonstrate willingness to compromise, but staying above my $12,000 limit.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $13,000 puts me in a better position. It gives Alice room to counter, potentially somewhere between our two prices, while keeping the negotiation active.
* **Time Constraint:** With several rounds remaining, I can still afford to negotiate strategically, but moving closer to my limit increases the pressure on Alice to make a more substantial move."
