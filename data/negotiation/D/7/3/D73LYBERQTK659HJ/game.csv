"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it.  This price is still a good deal for you and allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the product's value.  While $1,300,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for a slightly higher price point.  Would you consider $1,375,000? This allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,375,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000. This offer is still within your desired range and allows me to stay within budget. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
