,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10500 is still below what I need to accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $11250? This would be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. Let's find a way to close this deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $10750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000 as a final offer.  This would give you a good deal on the product, and it would allow us to close this transaction. I'm confident we can find a way to make this work.",11000.0,Alice,7,
