"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11,500. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** $11,500 is a starting point that is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum desired price. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is designed to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will reveal his willingness to negotiate.
* **Set a high starting point:**  This gives me room to negotiate downward if needed.
* **Leave room for counteroffers:** By not going too low, I can potentially secure a better price than John's offer if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $10000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I am open to negotiation, I will not accept an offer that drastically undervalues the product.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price. I will counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find common ground.  While John's offer of $12,000 is tempting, I have ten rounds to try and get closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:** $11,000 is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility while still ensuring I receive a price closer to my minimum desired amount.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, while still maintaining a firm stance on my price expectations.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show a willingness to negotiate:** By lowering my price, I show Bob that I'm open to compromise.
* **Maintain a higher price point:** $11,000 is still a fair price considering the product's worth to Bob.
* **Test the waters:** This counteroffer will reveal if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $10500. This is the highest amount I can offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,500 is slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since John is willing to pay my desired price.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob.  While I'm open to compromise, I'm not desperate and I'm confident I can get a better price if I keep pushing. This approach will help me maximize my profits while ensuring I don't settle for less than my product is worth."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still below what I need to accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? This would be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. Let's find a way to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:**  $11,250 is a compromise between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $10,500. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum desired amount.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and positive, focusing on finding a solution that benefits both parties. It emphasizes the value proposition for Bob and highlights the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show a willingness to negotiate:** By meeting Bob halfway, I demonstrate my commitment to reaching an agreement.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to increase my offer to $10750. This is the maximum amount I can afford to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. John's offer of $12,000 is always a fallback option if I can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to counteroffer Bob's proposal to try and bridge the gap. While the remaining rounds are getting limited, I believe I can still negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 as a final offer.  This would give you a good deal on the product, and it would allow us to close this transaction. I'm confident we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:** $11,000 represents a slight reduction from my previous offer, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. It still surpasses Bob's offer, and brings us closer to a potential agreement.
* **Message:**  The message remains friendly and emphasizes the potential benefits for Bob. I'm positioning this as a final offer to push Bob towards a decision.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show a willingness to compromise:**  By offering a slight reduction, I demonstrate a commitment to reaching a deal.
* **Maintain a price closer to my desired value:**  $11,000 is still significantly closer to my minimum target price than Bob's offer. 
* **Create urgency:** By labeling it a ""final offer,"" I encourage Bob to reconsider and potentially accept the offer.
* **Secure a deal:**  With only a few rounds remaining, I'm hoping to close a deal before resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've reviewed the situation again and decided to increase my offer to $10875. This is the highest amount I can afford to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer of $10,875 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's clear that we're not going to be able to close the deal at a price that satisfies my minimum requirements.  

**Strategy:**

Rather than continuing a seemingly unproductive negotiation, it's more prudent to accept John's offer of $12,000. This ensures I receive my minimum desired price and allows me to close the deal without further delay. While I might be able to get a higher price with another buyer, the risk of losing the deal altogether is too high with only two rounds remaining."
