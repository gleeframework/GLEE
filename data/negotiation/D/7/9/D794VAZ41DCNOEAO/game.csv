"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  It's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's try $8,900. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would let us finally make a deal.  What do you think?",8900.0,Alice,5,

"I really like the product, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",8200.0,Bob,6,
