Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $115 for it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $115 is higher than your minimum of $100, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  $115 is below Bob's perceived value of $120, giving him some wiggle room to negotiate.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  The message is simple and straightforward, focusing on the value proposition for Bob. 

By starting with a slightly higher price and leaving room for negotiation, you maximize your chances of getting a good deal while still keeping the conversation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While $110 is lower than your initial offer, it's still above your minimum of $100 and provides a decent profit.  Since you're not sure if you can get a better offer in the next round, and John is only offering $100, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option."
