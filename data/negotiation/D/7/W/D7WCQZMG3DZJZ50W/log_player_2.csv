"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a better deal than John's $10,000, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to Alice's $8,000 valuation."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your value. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $9,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet halfway.
