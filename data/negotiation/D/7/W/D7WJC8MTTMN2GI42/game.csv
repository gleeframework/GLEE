"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $11000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $12500? It's still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $12500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking of $12250. It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good compromise.",12250.0,Bob,4,
