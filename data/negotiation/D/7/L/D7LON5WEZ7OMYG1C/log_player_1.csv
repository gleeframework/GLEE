"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a high starting point, but it gives me room to negotiate and still potentially make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more. I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully will encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm offering $8,500. This is a smaller compromise than before, but it's still a bit above my minimum and hopefully will be attractive enough for Bob."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  Bob's offers are getting too low, and while I could counteroffer again, I'm not confident I'll get a better price from him. John is offering my minimum, so it's a safer choice to sell to him and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
