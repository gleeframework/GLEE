Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Offering $100 ensures Bob has some room to negotiate if he wants to, but it's still a good price for you.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This allows for a back-and-forth, giving you the chance to either lower the price slightly or stick to your initial offer.
* **It avoids immediate rejection:** It's unlikely Bob will immediately reject a $100 offer when it's still significantly lower than your minimum desired value. 

This strategy aims to maximize your earnings while keeping the negotiation open and potentially leading to a successful deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I believe that's a more reasonable price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
While $90 is less than what I initially hoped for, it's still above my minimum desired value of $120. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and allows me to avoid the risk of further negotiation that might result in a lower price or a failed sale."
