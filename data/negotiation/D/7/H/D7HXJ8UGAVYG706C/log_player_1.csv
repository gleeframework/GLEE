Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  While I'm not happy about the fact that I'm not able to get more from Bob, I've reached the point where I'm not confident I can get a higher offer from him. I'm concerned that I'm losing valuable time and potentially hurting my chances of a better deal by continuing to negotiate. I've already rejected several offers and the bargaining range is getting narrower, not wider. It's time to move on and secure the $1,200,000 offer from John."
