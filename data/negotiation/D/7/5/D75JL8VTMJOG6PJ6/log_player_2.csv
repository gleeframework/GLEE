"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $18,000.  It makes more sense to try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go above $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $16,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a step in the right direction, it's still above Bob's target price. Bob should continue to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm really hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $15,500? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to lower the price to $16,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and the efforts we've put into negotiating. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While she has come down in price, it's still above Bob's target price. Bob should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a better deal. He only has five rounds left before he has to choose to buy from John, so the pressure is on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a little out of my budget. I'm committed to finding a deal that works for both of us.  How about $15,750? That's a reasonable compromise, and we're getting very close. "", ""product_price"": 15750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to lower the price to $15,800. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and the efforts we've put into negotiating. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. It is the best price offered so far and is very close to his target price.  The risk of continuing negotiations is that Alice might not come down any further, and with only three rounds left, Bob might have to buy the product from John for $15,000.  Accepting Alice's offer is a reasonable compromise and guarantees Bob gets the product."
