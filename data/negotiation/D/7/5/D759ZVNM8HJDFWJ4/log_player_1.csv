Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's a great deal at $19,000. It's a unique item, and I'm confident it will serve you well. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A starting price of $19,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Emphasize Value:**  The message highlights the product's value and uniqueness to make the price more appealing.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to see if Bob is willing to pay a price significantly above his perceived value. If he accepts, you earn a profit above your minimum. If he rejects the offer, you can always fall back on selling to John at your desired price."
