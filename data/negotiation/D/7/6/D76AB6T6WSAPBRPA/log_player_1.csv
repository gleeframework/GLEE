Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.

You have three options:

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's my minimum price, it's better than selling to John. I'll have to be more strategic in future negotiations."
