Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $10,000. This is a unique item, and I'm confident it won't last long."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your desired outcome. 
* **Justification:** While a simple ""This is my price"" can work, offering a reason (even if it's just perceived value) can make the offer more palatable. 
* **Urgency:**  Subtly implying the product is in demand (""won't last long"") can nudge Bob towards a quicker decision. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is very price-sensitive or dislikes haggling, a slightly lower initial offer might be better.
* **Risk Tolerance:**  There's always a chance Bob will walk away. You need to weigh the potential for a higher price against the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
