"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you is even higher. I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to accept.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work. This is a valuable product, and I believe we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $1,075,000 is still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,087,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow us to move forward. What do you think?",1087500.0,Alice,5,
