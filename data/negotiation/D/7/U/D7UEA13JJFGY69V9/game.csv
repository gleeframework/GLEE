"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer that I think is fair and reasonable. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time.  This is my best offer, and I hope we can find a way to make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on it, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. ",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to give up too much on the value of the product. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm now offering the product to you for $925,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm ready to make a final offer of $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. If you are not willing to accept this offer, I will be forced to move forward with a different seller.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're making a final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up on the value of the product just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm now offering the product to you for $912,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.
