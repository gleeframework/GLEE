"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit high, and Bob can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get the price down closer to his desired range."
