"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs and valued at $10,000 to us. Given its high quality and relevance to your requirements, we believe it would be a valuable asset to you. Considering its worth to both parties, I am extending an offer to sell this product to you for $9,500. This is a special opportunity to acquire a product that could significantly benefit you, and I hope you find this proposal attractive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial valuation, it's still significantly higher than your $8,000 limit and the guaranteed $8,000 price from John. You have a better alternative available."
