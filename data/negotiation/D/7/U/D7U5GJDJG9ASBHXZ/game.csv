"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a price below its market value, and I get to make a fair profit. Let me know your thoughts!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $1,050,000? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,025,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
