"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While $11,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll see if I can negotiate a bit higher in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'm starting to feel the pressure,  $11,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise. If not, I'll sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here. $11,800 is still a little low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $12,200.  I think this is a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12200}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  We've reached a point where Bob's offers are just too low, and I'm worried I might not be able to get a better deal with him.  It's better to secure the $12,000 now than to risk a lower offer or continuing to negotiate with Bob."
