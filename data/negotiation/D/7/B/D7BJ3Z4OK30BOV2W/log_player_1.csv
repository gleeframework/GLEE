Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000,  but still leaves room for negotiation. It also reflects the value of the product to Bob while giving you a comfortable profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below what the product is worth to me. I will reject it and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer is still a good price for Bob as it's well below the $1,200,000 value he places on the product. It also shows that I'm willing to negotiate but not at a price that significantly undervalues my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price. While I would prefer a higher price, it's worth accepting and ending the negotiation to avoid further rounds and the risk of Bob walking away entirely."
