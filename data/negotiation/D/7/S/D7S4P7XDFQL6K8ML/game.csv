"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my costs.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $12,250. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value and my costs.",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer!  How about we split the difference between your last offer and my last counteroffer? I'd be willing to pay $11,625.",11625.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal! However, I'm not willing to go as high as $11,625. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $12,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",12000.0,Alice,7,
