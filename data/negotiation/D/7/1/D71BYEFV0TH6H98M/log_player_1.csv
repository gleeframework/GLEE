Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $13,500. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the baseline:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, so you shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Targeting Bob's valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000.  Offering it slightly above that might intrigue him.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Starting at $13,500 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price closer to your desired $15,000. 
* **Professional and inquisitive tone:** The message aims to initiate a conversation rather than present an ultimatum. 

This strategy maximizes the chance of selling above Bob's valuation while still maintaining a polite and professional approach."
