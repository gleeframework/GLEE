"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. It's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer of $100 is higher than both your maximum price and what John is offering. It makes the most sense to buy from John for $80."
