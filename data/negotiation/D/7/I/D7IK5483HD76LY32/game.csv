"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significant, and $1,200,000 undervalues it considerably.  Would you consider $1,350,000?  I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,250,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
