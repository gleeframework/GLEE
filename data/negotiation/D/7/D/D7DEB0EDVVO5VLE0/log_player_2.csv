# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm able to go right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $16,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $16,000 is still above my budget of $10,000. I will try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $14,000.  This would give us both a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value I've placed on it, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $15,500. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,500 is still above my budget. While the deal might be getting closer, I'm concerned that we're running out of rounds. It's wiser to go with the guaranteed $10,000 price from John to avoid risking going over my budget."
