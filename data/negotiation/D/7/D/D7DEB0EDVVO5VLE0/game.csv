"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm able to go right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $16,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $14,000.  This would give us both a fair deal. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value I've placed on it, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $15,500. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
