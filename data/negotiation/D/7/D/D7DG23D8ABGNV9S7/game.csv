"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,000,000. I understand it's a significant investment, but I believe the value it brings to your business will more than justify the cost. I'm confident we can come to an agreeable price, but I do have another buyer lined up willing to pay the full asking price.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my financial constraints.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your budget constraints. While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value of the product and also allows for a bit of room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my financial constraints.",900000.0,Bob,4,
