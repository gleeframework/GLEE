You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. $6,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to see how much room for negotiation there is.  If Alice rejects this, I'll have a better understanding of her desired price range and can adjust my counteroffers accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $5,500 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still hopeful I can get it lower. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product.  $5,000 is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is getting closer to my preferred price point.  While I could potentially try for a slightly lower price, at this point, I'm comfortable accepting the offer and securing the product. It's a good deal, and I've saved a significant amount compared to buying from John."
