Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $800,000 doesn't reflect the true value this product brings.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting a sense we're both determined to find a good deal.  While I value your offer of $850,000,  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $900,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $825,000 still feels a bit low for the value of this product. To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to drop my price to $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  Let's close this deal!
