"I'm interested in the product, but I think $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $10500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $9500 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering a final counteroffer of $10200. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for the product. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
