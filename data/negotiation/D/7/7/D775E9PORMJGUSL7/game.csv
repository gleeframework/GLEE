"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe you'll find it valuable, and I'm confident you'll be willing to pay a premium for it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $9000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $9000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to pay $8500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I believe the product's value is worth it, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9500 is still a bit steep for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $8750 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we've both discussed.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm not ready to meet you at $8750 just yet. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I think $9250 is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit. How about $9000? I'm really interested in this product, and I believe this price is fair considering the value we've discussed. Let's close the deal at this price.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm thinking $9200 is a fair price. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",9200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to compromise. Let's split the difference one last time. I'm willing to pay $9100 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",9100.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $9300. I think this is the minimum price that reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can meet at this price.",9300.0,Alice,9,
