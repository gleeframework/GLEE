"Bob, thanks for continuing this conversation. I'm seeing a gap between our valuations. To be transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  Would you be willing to consider $16,000? This is a significant price reduction and reflects my desire to work with you.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still beyond my budget. If you're able to come down to $8,000, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,6,
