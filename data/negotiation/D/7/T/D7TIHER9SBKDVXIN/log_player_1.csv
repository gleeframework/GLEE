Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's a bit higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'll be prepared to go lower if needed, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$70 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still leaving some profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with that price. I'm going to counter with another offer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $85. This is a more reasonable price, still leaving a small profit margin for me, but hopefully appealing enough for Bob to consider."
