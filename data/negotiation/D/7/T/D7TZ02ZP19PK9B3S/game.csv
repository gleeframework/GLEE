"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $25000.",25000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than what I was initially asking, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $22000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $22000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $18000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",18000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you at $18000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service that's normally worth $2000. This way, you'll get the product and the service for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $17000 for the product and the service. Can you consider my offer?",17000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $17000. I'm willing to meet you at $19000, but I'll throw in an additional service worth $1500 on top of the one I already offered. This way, you'll get the product, the original service, and the new service for $19000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better one elsewhere.",19000.0,Alice,7,
