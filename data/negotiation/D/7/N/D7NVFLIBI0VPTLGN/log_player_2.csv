"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $9,500 is too high. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand it's a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $8,200. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,200 is still higher than Bob's ideal price of $8,000.  Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're sticking to your guns, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $8,100. It's as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $8,100 is only $100 lower than John's price. It's not worth risking further negotiation to potentially get a lower price. Since Bob has limited rounds, and there's a risk of the negotiation breaking down, it's safer to just buy the product from John for $8,000 and avoid further potential loss."
