"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and we're looking to sell it for $110. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $110 is less than what he's willing to pay, he can likely get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you coming down a bit from your initial price. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $105. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50 for the product? This is still a good saving for you compared to its value, and it allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's counteroffer of $107.50 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's below his maximum value of $120 and closer to his desired price of $105. Accepting this offer ensures a purchase within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation or needing to buy from John at a higher price."
