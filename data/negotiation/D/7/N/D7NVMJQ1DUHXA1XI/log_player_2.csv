"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $100 from John. While Alice's offer is tempting, you can likely do better.  Rejecting gives you more negotiating room."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within my budget.  This shows I'm serious about negotiating but also leaves room for compromise. I want to see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is closer to my budget, I'm still within the negotiation rounds and can potentially get a better deal. John's offer of $100 is still a safety net, but I want to see if I can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing I'm willing to compromise. This offer is still within my budget and is closer to Alice's last offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground and secure a deal without having to resort to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90 is within my budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $100.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's getting late in the game and there's a risk of losing the deal altogether. It's time to secure the product at a reasonable price."
