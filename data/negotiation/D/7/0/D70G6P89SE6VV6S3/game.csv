"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the value this product brings to you.  I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us. Let's make this deal!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,050,000, but I'm still hoping for a better price. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair offer that reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe we can both be happy with this outcome.",950000.0,Bob,4,
