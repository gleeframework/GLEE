I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer.  He's lowballing me.  I'll try to get a better price from him before selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $900,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced the product is worth $900,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $875,000.

I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob.  $875,000 is close to what I'd get from John, but I want to maximize my profit.  I'll counteroffer again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $875,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's settle this now and avoid further rounds of negotiation."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle anytime soon. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll meet you at $892,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'd like to make a deal, but I need to be comfortable with the price.

I've reached my limit with Bob. He's not willing to budge much further, and I'm running out of time.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my asking price, it's better to secure a sale now than risk getting nothing at all.  I'll accept John's offer and sell the product for $800,000."
