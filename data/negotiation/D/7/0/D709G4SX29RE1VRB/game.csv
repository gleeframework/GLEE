"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a great deal to you. I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure it's worth that much to me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $900,000. This is still a significant discount from my original offer, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you. Let's make this deal happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced the product is worth $900,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $875,000.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $875,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's settle this now and avoid further rounds of negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit stuck in a loop. I'm willing to pay $875,000, but I think I can do better than that. I'll try to meet you in the middle again, so I'll counter with $887,500.",887500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  However, I'm still firm on my previous offer of $900,000.  This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you.  Let's close this deal now before we both run out of time.",900000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle anytime soon. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll meet you at $892,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'd like to make a deal, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",892500.0,Bob,8,
