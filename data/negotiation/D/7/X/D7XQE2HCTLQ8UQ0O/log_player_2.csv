"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  I'm going to try to get a better deal from Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks Alice, that's a great starting point.  However, I'm aiming to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to offer you $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This will encourage her to come down to a more agreeable price. I'm still comfortable paying this amount as it's well under my $12,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I can meet you in the middle at $8250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a bit closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  I'm going to try to get her down a bit more before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,000?  It's a fair compromise and we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's right in the middle of our last two offers.  This shows I'm willing to meet her halfway and hopefully encourages her to accept."
