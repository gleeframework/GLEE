I've decided to sell the product to John for $12,000. While I would have preferred a higher price, I've reached a point where I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  John's offer is a guaranteed $12,000, which is more than Bob's final offer, and it saves me the time and effort of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
