Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting closer. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I want to make this work. How about $775,000? That's a strong offer, and it gets us closer to a deal we both feel good about.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're past the halfway point in the negotiations and Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum. While he's incrementally increasing his offers, continuing this pattern might not result in a satisfying outcome within the remaining rounds. It's important to signal I'm willing to walk away if a fair price isn't reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but we're still quite far apart. This product holds significant value for me, and I need to reflect that in the price. I'm willing to come down to $850,000 as my final offer. Let me know if this works for you, as I do have other options available."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:**  This message establishes a sense of urgency and finality. By stating ""final offer,"" it signals to Bob that this is the lowest I'm willing to go.
* **Alternative:** Mentioning ""other options"" reminds Bob that I'm not desperate and am willing to walk away if the deal isn't right. 
* **Balance:** The price of $850,000 is a significant concession, but it's still above Bob's highest offer, leaving room for him to potentially counter with a more reasonable proposal."
