"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by its previous owners. Given its quality and utility, we believe it's worth $100. Considering its value to you, would you be interested in acquiring it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's message is persuasive, there's no harm in seeing if I can get a better price. I'll reject the offer and see if she's willing to negotiate. If not, I can always buy from John for $100."
