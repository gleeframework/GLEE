Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 could potentially work for both of you.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob while maximizing your profit.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can afford to be a bit bolder.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** This price is near the top of the ZOPA, leaving room for negotiation if needed.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and fairness of the offer, potentially making Bob more receptive.

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Response:**  How Bob responds will determine your next move. Be prepared to negotiate if he counters, but don't go below your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyers:** While John offers a safety net, knowing if there are other potential buyers could strengthen your position.
