"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but I am only able to pay up to $750,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which still allows for a reasonable profit for me. Let's meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I've considered your offer, Alice. While I'm not comfortable at $825,000, I would like to propose $775,000. This is still a substantial amount, but it's closer to what I'm willing to pay.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $775,000 is still a bit below my minimum. How about we settle at $800,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it avoids the need for further negotiations. Let me know if you're agreeable.",800000.0,Alice,5,
