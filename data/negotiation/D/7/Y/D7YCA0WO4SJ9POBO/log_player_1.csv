Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm setting the price at $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $12,000 allows room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value. It also signals that you understand the product's worth.
* **Creating Urgency and Exclusivity:** Mentioning other interest and a potential public listing creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, the open-ended question ""What do you think?"" leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, opening the door for negotiation.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit from Bob while having the security of John's offer as a fallback."
