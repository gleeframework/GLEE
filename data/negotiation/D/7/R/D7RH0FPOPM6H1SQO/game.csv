"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm currently looking to keep my expenses within a certain limit. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $8,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $8,500? This would still give me a reasonable profit while offering you a good deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Would it be possible to reach a compromise at $8,200?",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $8,200 is still a bit lower than what I need, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,350? This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to cover my costs.",8350.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $8,300. It's a bit closer to your original offer, but still within my budget.",8300.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $8,300 is very close to what I need. To make this deal work, how about we split the difference and agree on $8,325? This would give both of us a fair outcome. ",8325.0,Alice,7,
