"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

While $12,000 is less than your maximum price, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get a better price from her, closer to her $10,000 value."
