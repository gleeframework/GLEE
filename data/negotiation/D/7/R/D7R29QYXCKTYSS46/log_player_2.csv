"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a concession to make it happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more to Alice.  While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than what you can get elsewhere."
