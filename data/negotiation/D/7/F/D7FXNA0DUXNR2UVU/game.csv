"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget concerns, Bob, but $80 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind.  This product is worth a lot to the right buyer. How about we settle at $120? That's a fair compromise.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is valuable, but $120 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
