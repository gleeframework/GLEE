"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,200,000 to you.  Let's meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your valuation, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $1,100,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and puts us closer to a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,150,000. This would be a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
