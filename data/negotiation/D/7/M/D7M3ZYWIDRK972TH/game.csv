"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I'm looking for a slightly lower price point. Given the value I see in this product, I'd be happy to offer $1,200,000.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price point you've proposed. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price that reflects the product's worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's work together to find a solution.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, I still believe the product's value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. I'll make a counteroffer of $1,280,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value and our discussion so far.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
