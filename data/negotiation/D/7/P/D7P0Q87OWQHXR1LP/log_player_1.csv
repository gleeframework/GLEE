Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Know your worth:** You know John will buy the product for $15,000, which is your minimum acceptable price.
* **Aim high:** Starting with a higher offer than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) gives you room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value exceeding the offered price, potentially piquing Bob's interest. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** You make a great profit, exceeding your minimum by $3,000.
* **Bob negotiates:** You have space to lower the price and still get a better deal than selling to John.
* **Bob rejects:**  You haven't lost anything and can proceed with selling to John for your guaranteed price."
