"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. How about $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a price I'd be happy to pay. It leaves room for further negotiation if Alice isn't keen on $110."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to counteroffer again to try and get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $110 was a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to settle the negotiation fairly. It's a price that works well for me and is still a reasonable profit for Alice."
