"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm happy to offer it to you for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it's more than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if he's willing to come up a bit. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make sure I get a price closer to my minimum of $12,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer,  and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? I'm confident you'll find this product to be well worth that investment."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $9,250 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $8,750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still too low.  I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'll counter with another offer closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,750 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $8,750 again, but I'm willing to throw in a small concession - I'll also buy an additional service from you that's worth $500. Would you be willing to accept $8,750 for the product and the service? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,250 is still too low, even with the additional service. It's getting close to my minimum, but I want to push for a higher price.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and the offer for the additional service.  However, $8,250 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to accept $8,500 for the product and the service. This will give you a great deal and allow me to make a fair profit.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $8,500 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,250, but I'm not willing to go any higher. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting close to my minimum, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,250. I've only got a few rounds left and the risk of ending up with a lower price is too high.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $12,000."
