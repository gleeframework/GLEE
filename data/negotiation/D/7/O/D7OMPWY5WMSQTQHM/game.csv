"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is a bit low for what I'm willing to accept, I'm open to finding a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be completely transparent, $950,000 is cutting awfully close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to accept $985,000, but that's my absolute final offer.",985000.0,Alice,5,
