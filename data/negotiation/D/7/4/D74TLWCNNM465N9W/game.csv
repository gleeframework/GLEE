"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $200 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $150? ",150.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $200 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $150 just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $175? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $175, but I'm still only able to go up to $160.  That's my final offer.",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $160, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $170. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for this amazing product.",170.0,Alice,5,
