{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $10,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, emphasizing the value of the product. I'm also leaving the door open for further discussion.

**Strategy:**

* **Initial Offer:**  I'm starting high to maximize my potential profit.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $8,000 gives me a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fall through, I have a guaranteed sale.
* **Negotiation:**  I'm ready to counter Bob's offers if necessary, but I'll be mindful of my bottom line and John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm looking to save some money, and I'm not sure if this product is worth the full $10000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not eager to settle just yet. I'm going to try and negotiate a bit more. There's still room to potentially get a better price from Bob. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** I know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, so there's still a possibility of getting closer to that value.
* **Negotiation Dynamics:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and see if I can get a counteroffer closer to my preferred price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to carefully craft a counteroffer that is both attractive to Bob and still benefits me."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference? I'll offer you the product for $9,000. It's still a great price considering the value you'll get, and it gives us both a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price of $9,000, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,000. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a compromise, emphasizing the fairness and value for both of us. I'm also using a friendly tone to keep the negotiation positive.

**Strategy:**

* **Compromise:** By offering a middle ground, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate and potentially meet Bob halfway.
* **Maintain Value:** The price is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, ensuring I still profit from the sale.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion and potential counteroffers from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $9500? That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $9,500 is a good deal for me. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and it's closer to my initial offer of $10,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Margin:**  I'm still making a good profit on the sale, even at $9,500.
* **Negotiation Exhaustion:**  Further negotiation could potentially lead to a higher price, but it also risks dragging out the process and increasing the chances of Bob backing out entirely.
* **Opportunity Cost:** By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale quickly and avoiding the possibility of having to sell to John at a lower price.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision given the current circumstances. It maximizes my profit while minimizing the risk of losing the sale."
