"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher price than selling to John immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $85 is higher than Bob's perceived value, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $120.  I'm confident I can secure a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? This would be a fair price for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
``` 
I'm offering a counteroffer of $92.50. This is a compromise that is closer to my desired price while still being potentially acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $92.50 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88. That's a significant compromise on my end, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $88 is higher than his initial offer, it's still lower than my minimum desired price of $120. I have a few more rounds left, and I want to see if I can secure a higher price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering $90, which is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price. I'm hoping that this will be enough to convince Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  $88 is the most I can do.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'll take it.  Otherwise, I might need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $88 is still too low for me. We've been negotiating for a few rounds, and I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach an agreement. I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $120 from John.  I'm going to sell the product to John."
