{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and features, I'm offering it to you at $20,000.  I believe it's a fair price that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) and even your minimum ($15,000) sets a strong anchor.  This may make a lower counter-offer from Bob more likely to fall within a range acceptable to you.
* **Justification:** Highlighting ""unique value and features"" attempts to justify the high price, even if Bob doesn't fully buy into it.
* **Exclusivity and Urgency:**  The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" and mentioning a public listing aims to create a sense of urgency and scarcity.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** This offer is a starting point. Be prepared for Bob to negotiate. You know you have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, so use that as your bottom line.
* **Bob's Perspective:**  Keep in mind that if Bob sees through the tactics and feels the price is wildly unreasonable, he might walk away entirely. 
* **Flexibility:** Based on Bob's response, be ready to adjust your price slightly in a follow-up offer."
