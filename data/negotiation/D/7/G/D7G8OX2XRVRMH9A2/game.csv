"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $9000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11000. What do you think?"

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm firm on my offer of $9500. Let's see if we can close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10200. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that we're close to a fair price."
