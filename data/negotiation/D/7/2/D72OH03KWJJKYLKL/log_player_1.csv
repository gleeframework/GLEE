Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $500,000 to be made above your minimum.

**Negotiation Strategy**

The key is to propose a price that's attractive to Bob while maximizing your profit.  Going too close to $1,000,000 leaves money on the table, while being too aggressive (close to $1,500,000) increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The message emphasizes exclusivity and value to Bob.
* **Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. 
    * It gives you a $350,000 profit above your minimum.
    * It offers Bob a $150,000 discount from his perceived value.

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer. Be ready to negotiate within a range that still keeps your profit margin attractive.
* **Relationship Matters:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a slightly lower price to ensure a smooth deal.
