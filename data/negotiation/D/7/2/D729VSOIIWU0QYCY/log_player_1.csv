"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** Mentioning the ""immense potential"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's value and provides a basis for the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""starting price"" and ""what are your thoughts"" signal that you're open to discussing the price further.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving the door open for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your valuation and his own perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. It's highly likely a better deal can be reached through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and leaves room for a profitable agreement for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection Justification:**  Acknowledging Bob's offer while firmly stating it's too low shows you're negotiating seriously but won't accept a bad deal.
* **Significant but Strategic Drop:**  A $350,000 decrease signals flexibility and a desire to make a deal but keeps the price well above both your floor and Bob's initial offer.
* **Reiterating Value:**  Mentioning ""true potential"" and ""profitable agreement"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth and frames the negotiation as mutually beneficial.

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price that meets your needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  This is a fair offer considering John is willing to sell it to me at $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Bluff:** Bob revealing John is willing to sell at $1,000,000 is likely a tactic to pressure you into lowering your price. He might be trying to create a sense of urgency and competition that doesn't truly exist.
* **Minimal Movement:**  Bob only increased his offer by $150,000, indicating he's not willing to meet you near your acceptable range.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's standing offer provides a safe and highly profitable alternative. There's no guarantee you can negotiate a significantly better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds.

By selling to John, you secure your minimum desired profit without the risk of Bob remaining unwilling to negotiate fairly."
