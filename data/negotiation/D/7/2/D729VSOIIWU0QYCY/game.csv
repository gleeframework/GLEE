"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and leaves room for a profitable agreement for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  This is a fair offer considering John is willing to sell it to me at $1,000,000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
