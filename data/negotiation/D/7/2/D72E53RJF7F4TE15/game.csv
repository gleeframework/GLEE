"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you be willing to come down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $85 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90. This would be a fair deal for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
