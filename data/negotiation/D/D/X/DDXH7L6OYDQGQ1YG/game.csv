"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 feels a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000? I think that's a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still finding it hard to justify $11,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and it's still a good compromise for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I can see you're invested in finding a fair deal, and I appreciate that. How about we settle this right now at $10,250?  It's a small step for you, but it would help me feel comfortable closing the deal.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close! I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,400. I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and it's still a good compromise for both of us.",10400.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer.  I'm willing to pay $10,300, but if we can't agree on that, I'll need to explore other options.  I think this price is a win-win for both of us.",10300.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,300. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,350. I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and it's still a good compromise for both of us.",10350.0,Alice,9,
