"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the value of the item, but I was hoping to find it within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on a price closer to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  Could we meet in the middle and say $160?  I'm confident you'll find it's worth that price.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to keep the price within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $120?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $120. How about we split the difference again and settle on $140? This is my final offer.",140.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I've been thinking about it and I'd like to propose $130 as a compromise. It's higher than my initial offer but still within my budget.",130.0,Bob,6,
