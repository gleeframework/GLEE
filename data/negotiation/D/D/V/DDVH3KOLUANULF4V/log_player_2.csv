"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  You have room to go lower than $1,200,000 before hitting your maximum budget.  Let's see if we can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
``` 
 
Let's start by making a significant counteroffer.  A million dollars is a substantial discount from Alice's initial price, and it leaves us some room to negotiate further if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down in price, but there's still room for a better deal. Let's keep negotiating to see if we can get closer to our ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

We'll increase our offer slightly to $1,050,000.  This shows Alice we're serious about making a deal, but still leaves space for us to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to our target price. It's a better deal than what John is offering, and with only five rounds left, it's probably a good time to take the deal. We can always try to negotiate a better price with John later if we need to."
