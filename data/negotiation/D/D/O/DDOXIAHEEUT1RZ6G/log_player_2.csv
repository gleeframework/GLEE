"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $90, which is above Bob's maximum budget of $100.
* **Alternative:** John offers the product for $100, which is within Bob's budget.
* **Strategy:** It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the next round. If that fails, Bob can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Would you be willing to go down to $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save money.
* **Starting point:** Alice's offer of $90 is too high.
* **Counteroffer:** $85 is a reasonable starting point, below Bob's maximum budget and closer to Alice's value.
* **Message:** Emphasizes interest in the product but also expresses a desire for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $87.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save money, but still get the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $87.50, which is within Bob's budget.
* **Alternative:** John offers the product for $100.
* **Strategy:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject the counteroffer and they could run out of rounds.  $87.50 is a good compromise, and Bob can save $2.50 compared to buying from John."
