"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, $1,100,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price is still very fair considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is my absolute minimum. This price is still very fair considering the value of the product for you.  Let's finalize this deal.
