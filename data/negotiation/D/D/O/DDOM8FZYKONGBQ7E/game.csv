"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair for both of us. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $850,000?  I believe this is a price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a profitable transaction. Let me know if you'd like to discuss further.",850000.0,Alice,1,
