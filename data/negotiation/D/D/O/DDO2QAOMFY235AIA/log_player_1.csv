Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts high, knowing Bob values the product at $100. This allows for room to negotiate and potentially reach a price that benefits both of us.  It also shows I'm confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $100. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $150.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is still a fair price for the product, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
