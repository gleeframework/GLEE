"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I know the product is worth $80 to Bob, so he might be willing to negotiate. I also have the option to sell to John for $100, so I'm not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a profit higher than what John is offering.  I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, but I'm starting to think that John might be the safer bet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but this time I'm offering the same amount that John is willing to pay. This is my last chance to get a better price from Bob, otherwise, I'll just sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer is getting lower, and I'm running out of time.  It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John than to risk getting a lower offer from Bob or potentially ending up with nothing."
