"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great value at $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money, and Alice's initial offer is higher than his maximum price.  It's best to reject and counteroffer to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still above his ideal price point. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives Bob more negotiating power to try and reach a price closer to his $120 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the compromise, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. How about $125? That's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob! I can do $128, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $128
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is close to Bob's maximum, Bob is still aiming to save more money.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer will keep the negotiation going and might push Alice closer to Bob's target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I really appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  I'm still hoping for a little more room to work with.  How about $122?  That's a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 122}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $128, Bob. I've already given you a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $126, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $126. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $126
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is very close to his maximum price, but he's still hoping to save a bit more.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer one more time might convince Alice to come down just a little further.  If it doesn't, he's only one round away from buying from John at his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $126 is still a bit outside my budget.  If you're willing to meet me halfway at $124, we can finalize this deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 124}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not going to go any lower than $128, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $127, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $127
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $127 is still above Bob's maximum price, and there's only one round left. It's not worth risking another counteroffer that might be rejected.  Bob is better off buying from John at $120, which is his ideal price."
