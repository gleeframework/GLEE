,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. Is that something you'd be interested in?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. How about $125? That's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob! I can do $128, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with it.",128.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I really appreciate you coming down in price, Alice.  I'm still hoping for a little more room to work with.  How about $122?  That's a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to stay within my budget.",122.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $128, Bob. I've already given you a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $126, but that's as low as I can go.",126.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $126 is still a bit outside my budget.  If you're willing to meet me halfway at $124, we can finalize this deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",124.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not going to go any lower than $128, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $127, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",127.0,Alice,9,
