"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not desperate to sell immediately.  I'd like to see if I can get a little closer to my desired price.  Rejecting his offer gives me more leverage to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. While $8,500 is closer to my budget, I still believe we can reach a better agreement. Could you consider $8,200 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still not happy with $8,200. I'm confident I can get a higher offer, especially since John is willing to pay $8,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer gives me more leverage to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us.  While $8,200 is closer, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  Let's meet in the middle again at $8,350.  This price is fair considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 8350}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and I'm willing to compromise. How about $8,250 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has gotten very close to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not confident I can push him much higher.  Accepting his offer secures a sale and gets me very close to my desired price.  Furthermore, I have John as a backup option if this deal falls through."
