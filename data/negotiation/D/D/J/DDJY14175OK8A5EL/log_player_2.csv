"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll be impressed with its features and benefits. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  It's worth $1,000,000 to her, and she's already starting at $1,200,000. I can likely get a much better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given the value of this product, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I believe the product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. She's only come down $100,000 from her initial offer, and it's still far from the $1,000,000 value she places on it. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. This price is a good compromise for both of us, and it will allow us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a good compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make another concession and sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This price still reflects the value I believe the product holds, but I'm trying to be more flexible to reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing some flexibility, $1,250,000 is still too high. I'm confident I can negotiate further and reach a price closer to my target.  I'm still well within my budget and have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""We're getting closer. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to close this deal. I'm confident we can both walk away satisfied with this price."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still believe the product's value is worth more than $1,150,000. I'm willing to make another concession and sell it to you for $1,225,000. This price is a fair reflection of the product's worth, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my price, $1,225,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident I can get her down further, and I still have time to negotiate. There's no need to rush into a deal at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  $1,225,000 is still quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $1,175,000. This is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and our respective needs. Let's seal this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1175000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,175,000. I'm willing to make one final concession and sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This price is a bit higher than I'd like, but I'm trying to reach a deal with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Alice's final offer and it's getting close to my target.  I'm running out of time and  $1,200,000 is still a good deal for me, as it's less than what I'd pay John. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid going to John."
