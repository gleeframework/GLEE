{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum price of $1,200,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.  This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a good price:** $1,100,000 is a strong starting point and still leaves me with a profit.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will reveal his willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't serious."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only able to pay $1,050,000 for the product at this time. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum, I am not yet willing to accept it.  I will counter-offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

I'm aiming for a middle ground here:

* **Compromise:**  This offer is a step closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Still profitable:**  $1,075,000 is above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I still make a decent profit.
* **Pressure on Bob:** This counter-offer shows I'm serious about selling, but not desperate.  It puts the ball back in his court."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am unable to meet your price. I would like to propose $1,060,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
