Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $190.  I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 190}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price later.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While the product is worth $150 to Bob, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more if he perceives the product as valuable or if it fulfills an immediate need. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below your minimum.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  You get a great deal at $190!
* **Bob Negotiates:** Bob might counter-offer. You can then decide if you want to negotiate down towards his valuation or hold firm.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for your minimum of $150, ensuring you don't lose out."
