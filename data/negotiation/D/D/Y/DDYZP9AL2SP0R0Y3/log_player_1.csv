Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $100 is higher than $80, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's below your $120 floor, allowing for potential profit.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  It clearly states the price and provides a friendly opening. 

Remember, this is just the first offer. Depending on Bob's response, you'll need to adjust your strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120.  Since you have the option to sell to John for a much higher price, it makes sense to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a fair price, and I'm willing to go a bit higher. How about $90? It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to your minimum:** $90 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for future negotiation:**  Even though it's not ideal, you could potentially get a better price if you continue negotiating, but there's no guarantee.
* **Risk of losing John:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing John, who is willing to pay your full asking price.

Since $90 is a good price and there's a risk of losing the sale to John, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option."
