"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $9,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob's initial counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still higher than Alice's value. This signals that Bob is serious about buying the product but wants a good deal.
* **Negotiation Space:** This offer provides room for further negotiation without immediately risking the deal falling apart. 
* **Value Consideration:**  Bob's offer is well below his maximum value of $10,000, ensuring he still gets a good deal even if Alice counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. However, the value of this product is quite high, and $8,500 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  Could you meet me halfway at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice's counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate, moving from $9,500 to $9,000.
* **Target Price:** Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $8,500. 
* **Negotiation Space:** There is still a gap between Alice's offer and Bob's desired price, justifying a counteroffer to try and bridge the difference.

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially achieve a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $9,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference at $8,750? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to compromise, demonstrating good faith in the negotiation.
* **Fairness:** Offering to split the difference suggests a reasonable and balanced approach.
* **Moving Closer:** The offer is closer to Alice's last price, but still below Bob's desired price.  This creates pressure for Alice to make a decision."
