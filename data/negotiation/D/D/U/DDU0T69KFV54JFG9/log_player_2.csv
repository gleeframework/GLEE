Round 2

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too steep for me.  This product would be valuable to me at around $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your perspective on the value, but $10,000 is quite a bit below what I'm looking for. Could we agree on a price of $17,000? I'm willing to be a bit flexible if we can reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $17,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $11,000.  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for being open to negotiation. I'm motivated to make a deal, so I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is my final offer.  It's a very fair price, and I need to be sure this is worthwhile for me.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Reason: While Alice has come down in price, she's still at her absolute highest valuation.  It's unlikely she'll go below $15,000. You can get the product for $12,000 from John, which is your upper limit. There's no point in further negotiation."
