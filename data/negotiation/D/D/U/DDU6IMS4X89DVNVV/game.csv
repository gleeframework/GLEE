"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This gives you a good price while allowing me to make a profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $8,750? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $8,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, but that's my final offer. If you're serious about buying the product, I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your decision.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and my previous offer of $8,750. How about we try $8,875? I'm getting close to my limit, and I'd like to make a deal happen.",8875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,875 is just not a realistic price for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be compensated fairly for this product.  How about $8,950?  That's a very small difference from your last offer and it's the lowest I can go. Let's close this deal.",8950.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,950. I'm willing to meet you at $8,900, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. If you're willing to accept this price, I'm ready to make a deal.",8900.0,Bob,8,
