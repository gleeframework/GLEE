Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price, but not so high that it's likely to scare Bob off immediately.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is close to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm going to counter Bob with $145. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still above Bob's current offer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, but if not, I'm still prepared to keep negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $142 is pretty close to my desired price. At this point, I'm willing to accept to avoid further negotiation and the risk of Bob backing out. I'm also comfortable with the price as it's still significantly higher than what I would get from John."
