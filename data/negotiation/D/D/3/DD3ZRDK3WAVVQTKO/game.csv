"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential. My asking price is $1,150,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000? That's still a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your current offer. How about $975,000? That's the best I can do at this point.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go a bit lower than my previous offer, but we're getting closer. How about $1,025,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of this product. ",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close, Alice, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but that's my final offer. I hope we can meet in the middle and come to an agreement.",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have your limits, but $990,000 is still too low.  I'm willing to compromise and come down to $1,010,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the progress we've made in our negotiation. Let's finalize this deal.",1010000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,010,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $1,002,500? That's the best I can do at this point.",1002500.0,Bob,8,
