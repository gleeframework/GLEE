Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. However,  $1,600,000 is still a significant jump from my last offer.  To be honest, anything above $800,000 is pushing it for me. How about we settle at  $800,000 even? This would be my final offer.

**Reasoning:** Bob has made it clear that $800,000 is his absolute limit.  While this is more than half his initial offer, it's still significantly less than my minimum price and what John is willing to pay. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge this gap. Accepting John's offer ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price."
