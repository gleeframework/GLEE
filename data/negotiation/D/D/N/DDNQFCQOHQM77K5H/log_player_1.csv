Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value of $100, but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob some incentive to accept, while still maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll try to get a better price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $105. This is still higher than Bob's initial offer but closer to his perceived value, making it more likely he'll accept while still allowing me to profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $98 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $120, I'm going to sell to John. It's not the best possible price, but it ensures I meet my minimum profit requirement."
