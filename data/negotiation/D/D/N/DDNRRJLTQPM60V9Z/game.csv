"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to pay $140 for it.",140.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $160, but that's as low as I can go. I'm confident you'll love the product, and I think it's worth every penny.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $160 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $155?",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $155, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer you $162.50. That's the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",162.5,Alice,5,
