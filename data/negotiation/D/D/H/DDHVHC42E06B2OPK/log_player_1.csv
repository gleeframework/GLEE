Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value without explicitly stating it, encouraging Bob to consider its potential worth.
* **Alternative Option:**  I am aware that I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000. This knowledge gives me leverage to aim higher with Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Reaction:**  I need to be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or reject my initial offer. I'll need to decide my next move based on his response. 
* **Negotiation:** My goal is to maximize profit, but I also want to avoid being overly aggressive and potentially losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
