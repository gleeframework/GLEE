"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This sets a high bar for negotiations and allows me to potentially make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with a price of $1,250,000. This is still above my minimum, but lower than my initial offer.  I'm aiming to find a middle ground and hopefully close the deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that we can agree on a deal. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the sale."
