"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  This price still allows for some profit for me while being more reasonable for you.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $60 is low, but $105 is still a bit much for me.  Could you do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $75 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $90?  This would be a good compromise that allows us both to get a fair deal.",90.0,Alice,5,
