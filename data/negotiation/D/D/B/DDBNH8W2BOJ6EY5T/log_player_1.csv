Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $95 is above your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $100, so there's space for him to counteroffer without you feeling pressured to immediately drop your price. 
* **It's not too aggressive:**  If you offered too close to $100, you might leave yourself with little room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, you can potentially secure a price closer to your desired $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you consider $87.50? It's a bit closer to my original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $87.50 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $80.  While you would ideally get closer to $95, the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or a rejection from Bob is high.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
