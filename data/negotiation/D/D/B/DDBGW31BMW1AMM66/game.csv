"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After considering your potential interest, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the initial price, I'm aiming for a bit lower to ensure a win-win scenario for both of us. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting the value I've placed on it. Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both sides.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire for a compromise, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of this product. Considering your initial offer of $850,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $875,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you've placed on the product, while also ensuring I get a reasonable return on my investment. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
