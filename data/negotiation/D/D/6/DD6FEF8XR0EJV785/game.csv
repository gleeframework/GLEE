"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $11,200 to make it worth my while. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $11,200 is still a bit higher than where I want to be.  Let's try $10,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make a bit of a concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm thinking $11,100 might be a sweet spot for both of us. What do you think?",11100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I think we're both getting closer to a deal.  Let's split the difference again and go with $10,900.  This price is fair for both of us, and it'll allow us to close this deal.  What do you say?",10900.0,Bob,6,

"I like the way you think, Bob! Splitting the difference is a good way to get to a deal. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $11,050, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11050.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I think we're very close to a deal. Let's try $11,000, which is a fair price for both of us. It allows me to stay within my budget, and it gives you a profit.  Let's finalize this deal and move on.",11000.0,Bob,8,

"I think we're getting a bit too close to the wire, Bob. I'm not willing to sell at $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $11,050, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best price for this product. Let's try $11,050 again. What do you think?",11050.0,Alice,9,
