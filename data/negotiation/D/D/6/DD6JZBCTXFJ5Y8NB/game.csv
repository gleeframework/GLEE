"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700000 is simply too low.  It doesn't even cover my minimum requirements. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $850000, which still reflects the product's exceptional value. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to work within your budget. However, $750000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $800000. This price is fair and allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Alice,5,
