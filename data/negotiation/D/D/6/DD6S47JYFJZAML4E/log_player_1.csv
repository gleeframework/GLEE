"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an offer of $1,100,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's estimated value of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also leaves me a good profit margin, as my minimum is $1,200,000. 

I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his initial estimate, and this offer sets the stage for a potential counteroffer from him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,200,000. While I want to close the deal, accepting this offer would result in a significant financial loss. I need to keep negotiating to try and secure a better price. 

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially push the price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering with $950,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's current offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's initial valuation. It allows for further negotiation, while also showcasing my commitment to reaching a deal. I believe this offer is reasonable enough to keep Bob engaged, while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  It's tempting to accept, but  I'm committed to getting closer to my target. I believe we can still negotiate a higher price with further rounds.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price.  If this doesn't work, I can always sell to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $975,000.  This is only a slight increase from Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to meet him halfway. It's still well above his initial valuation, but lower than my previous offer. I believe this approach will keep Bob engaged and move us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $925,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I'm running out of rounds, but I'm still committed to getting closer to my target. I believe we can still negotiate a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price and see if we can reach an agreement.  If this doesn't work, I can always sell to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm going to stick with $950,000.  This offer is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's current one. It acknowledges Bob's willingness to move closer to my desired price, but still allows for some room for negotiation. 

With only a few rounds left, it's time to try and close the deal. I'm hoping that Bob will realize that my price is reasonable and accept the offer. If he doesn't, I can always sell to John for $1,200,000."
