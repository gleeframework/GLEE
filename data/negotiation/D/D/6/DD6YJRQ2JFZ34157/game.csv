"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise at $1300000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
