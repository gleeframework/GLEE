Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, but still above his offer."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,300,000 is a good compromise and significantly better than selling to John for $1,200,000."
