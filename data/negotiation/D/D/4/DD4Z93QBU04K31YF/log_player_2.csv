"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. This is a fair price considering its unique value. I believe this is a great opportunity for you, but I'm also open to hearing your thoughts and potential counteroffers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you know John is willing to sell for the same price, it's always advantageous to try and negotiate with Alice.  By rejecting her offer, you can see if she's willing to lower her price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is unfortunately below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $1,500,000 to $1,350,000, which is a good start. However, you are still aiming to save as much money as possible.  By rejecting her offer again, you can potentially push her to lower the price further."
