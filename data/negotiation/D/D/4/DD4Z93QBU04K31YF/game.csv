"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1200000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is unfortunately below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1300000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us and allow us to close the deal. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
