"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and show that I'm serious about purchasing the product. Can you consider this offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique product. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product is unique, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1300000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider this offer?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're still interested in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1500000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.
