"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive offer, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $850,000 for it. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm still making a fair profit. I can sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you accept it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $950,000. I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, so I'll meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $1,000,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
