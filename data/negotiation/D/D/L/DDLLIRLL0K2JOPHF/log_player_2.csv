**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down in price, but it's clear she's trying to hold out for as much as possible. She's using phrases like ""one-time offer"" to create urgency. Since we have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed savings rather than risk Alice not budging any further."
