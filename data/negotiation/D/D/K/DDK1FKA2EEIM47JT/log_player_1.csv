"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Opening High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm framing the offer in a way that highlights the product's value to Bob, potentially making him more inclined to accept. 
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and inviting, creating a positive atmosphere for negotiation.

**Note:**  This is just the first round. I'm prepared to adjust my offer based on Bob's response and the need to close the deal within the 10 rounds.  If Bob rejects my offer, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and the possibility of selling to John if it's in my best interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss for me. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, the fact that he's interested and has made a counteroffer suggests room for negotiation. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain leverage and potentially secure a better price in the next rounds.  

**Next Steps:** I'll carefully consider how to counter Bob's offer while remaining within the acceptable range for me and maximizing my potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $600,000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'm prepared to reduce the price to $900,000, reflecting the value of the product and our ongoing dialogue. This represents a significant compromise on my end. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I've lowered my price from $1,200,000 to $900,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm still highlighting the product's value to reinforce its worth to Bob.
* **Positive Negotiation:**  My message remains friendly and focused on finding a mutually beneficial outcome. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** $900,000 is a significant step closer to Bob's offer, while still being within my acceptable range.
* **Time Pressure:**  As we're only in round 3, I have time to negotiate further, but I want to demonstrate a willingness to reach an agreement. 
* **Assessing Bob's Response:** I'll observe Bob's reaction to this counteroffer to gauge his willingness to continue the negotiation and potentially adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** $700,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  
* **Negotiation Continues:** Bob is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and seems to be getting closer to my desired price point.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting this offer keeps me in a strong position to potentially secure a more favorable deal in the remaining rounds. 

**Next Steps:** I'll carefully craft a counteroffer that is a reasonable compromise, but also protects my financial interests. I'll consider the remaining rounds and the risk of not securing a deal with Bob. If necessary, I'll be prepared to sell to John if it's the best option for me."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While $700,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  To show you I'm serious about reaching a deal, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise between our positions.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moderate Compromise:** I'm lowering my offer to $850,000, moving closer to Bob's offer while still being above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Emphasize Compromise:** I'm framing my offer as a significant concession to make Bob feel like we're making progress.
* **Positive Urgency:** I'm expressing a desire to reach a deal, creating a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive.

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** This offer is in the middle of my previous offer ($900,000) and Bob's offer ($700,000).
* **Remaining Time:** With five rounds left, I want to make a reasonable offer to potentially secure a deal but also leave room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Evaluating Bob's Response:** I'll observe how Bob responds to this offer to gauge his willingness to compromise and determine my next steps. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to adjust my strategy further."
