"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $600,000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'm prepared to reduce the price to $900,000, reflecting the value of the product and our ongoing dialogue. This represents a significant compromise on my end. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While $700,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  To show you I'm serious about reaching a deal, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise between our positions.  Let's make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,5,
