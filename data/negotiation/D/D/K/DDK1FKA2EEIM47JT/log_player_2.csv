Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $600,000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to negotiate further.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge much further:** She's already made significant concessions, and her latest offer is still above your absolute limit.  
* **John's offer is a guaranteed win:** You know you can get the product for $800,000 right now.  
* **Time is money:**  Further negotiation with Alice risks running out of rounds and potentially missing out on both deals. 

While there's a *chance* Alice might go lower, it's not worth the risk of ending up with no deal or a price higher than John's guaranteed offer."
