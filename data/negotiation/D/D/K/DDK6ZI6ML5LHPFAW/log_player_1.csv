{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it brings will be more than worth it for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** This offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price but still represents a substantial profit for me. 
* **Appealing to value:**  Highlighting the value the product brings to Bob can encourage him to consider the price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By not going straight to my minimum price, I create room for negotiation and potential compromise. 
* **John as backup:** The knowledge that I have another buyer at a much higher price gives me leverage and allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll be getting from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and far less than the initial offer I made.  
* **Potential for better deal:**  Since I know John is willing to pay $1,500,000, there's a good chance I can get closer to that price by continuing the negotiation with Bob. 
* **Leveraging John:** The threat of selling to John gives me leverage to push for a higher price.

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,250,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while acknowledging your potential value from the product. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is a significant decrease from my initial offer but is still significantly higher than Bob's. It shows I am willing to compromise but not cave in.
* **Emphasizing profit:** I am highlighting that this price still allows me to make a profit, putting pressure on Bob to consider my perspective.
* **Finding compromise:** The language encourages Bob to see this as a potential compromise and find a middle ground.

I'm still confident I can get closer to my target price with John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,250,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $1,050,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **John is a better option:** Given John's willingness to pay $1,500,000, it's simply not worth risking a lower sale to Bob.
* **Time is valuable:**  Further negotiation with Bob might waste valuable time and effort.

I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  This is the best possible outcome for me, securing the highest price and guaranteeing a successful sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your persistence, $1,050,000 is simply too far below what I need to make this deal work.  I understand you have a budget, but I'm not willing to go lower than $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to you.  If you're not able to meet that price, I'll be moving forward with another buyer who is."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** This counteroffer is a compromise from my previous offer but is still significantly higher than Bob's. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but not give up on my desired price.
* **Emphasize value and compromise:** I highlight the value the product brings to Bob and position this as a fair compromise.
* **Set a clear deadline:**  Stating that I'll move forward with another buyer creates a sense of urgency and motivates Bob to consider my offer. 

I'm still hoping to reach a deal with Bob, but I'm prepared to move on to John if necessary."
