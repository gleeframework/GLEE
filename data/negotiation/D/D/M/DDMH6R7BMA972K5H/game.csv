"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $15,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit of $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down significantly?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $9,000? It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $9,000 is closer, it's still above what I'm comfortable spending. How about we try $7,000?  That's a reasonable compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but $7,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $8,500? It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise.",8500.0,Alice,5,
