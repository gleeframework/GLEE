You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $9,000? It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $8,000.

You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but $7,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $8,500? It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $8,500.  Since you can get the product for $8,000 from John, it makes more sense to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed lower price."
