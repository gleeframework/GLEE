Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, I'll aim to get as close to that value as possible. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $799,000}

I'm hoping Bob will find this offer reasonable and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is lower than I was hoping for, but it's still a decent amount. Since I can sell the product to John for $800,000, I'm not desperate to sell it to Bob. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.
