"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Could we potentially agree on something closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,050,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go up to $1,075,000. I think this is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
