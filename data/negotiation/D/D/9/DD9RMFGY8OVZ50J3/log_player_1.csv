{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by aiming for a significant profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  It's important to remember that I can always walk away and sell to John for $800,000, so I have a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, I'm still aiming for a higher profit.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome. I can also use this rejection to gauge his level of interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm prepared to go down to $1,100,000. This price still allows me to make a decent profit, while also providing you with a significant value.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this strikes a good balance between your needs and mine. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $1,100,000.  Given that I can always sell to John for $800,000, accepting this offer guarantees a profit of $250,000.  Further negotiation might lead to a slightly higher price, but there's a risk that Bob will walk away or I'll spend too much time negotiating. Accepting this offer is a safe and sensible choice."
