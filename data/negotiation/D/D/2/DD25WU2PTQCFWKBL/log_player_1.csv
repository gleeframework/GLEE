Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $99."", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $99 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially getting you even closer to your $100 goal. 
* **Psychological Pricing:** $99 feels significantly cheaper than $100 to most buyers, making it more appealing.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $99. If he's a tough negotiator or simply unwilling to pay above his perceived value of $80, you'll get the $100 from John, which still meets your minimum requirement."
