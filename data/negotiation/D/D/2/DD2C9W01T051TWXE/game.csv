"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,250 is closer, I'm still a bit over budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $11,500? This price is a fair compromise, considering the value to both of us and allows us to close the deal quickly. ",11500.0,Bob,4,
