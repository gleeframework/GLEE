Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is a bit high for me. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $11,000. This price is fair considering the product's worth to both of us.  Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.
