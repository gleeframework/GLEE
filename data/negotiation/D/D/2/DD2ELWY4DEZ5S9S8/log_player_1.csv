This offer gives me a good starting point and leaves some room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle.  I'm confident that I can sell it to John for $1,200,000 if Bob doesn't bite, so I'm not in a rush to accept any lowball offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for your product. This still allows me to save some money while being fair to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by counteroffering. I'll see if I can get him to budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. "", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've done some research and found that the market value of this product is closer to $1,050,000. Considering that, I would like to propose a price of $1,060,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get much more out of him. It's better to lock in a profit at this point than to risk losing him and having to sell to John for the same price."
