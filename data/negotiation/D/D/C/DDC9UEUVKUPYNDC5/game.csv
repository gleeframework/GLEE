"Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value. Let's see if we can work something out.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  This offer reflects the true worth of what you're gaining.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you adjusting your price, but $1,450,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to go up to $1,250,000. This represents a substantial investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the product's value. Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
