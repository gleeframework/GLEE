``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is slightly below my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I am optimistic about getting a good deal with Bob, but I'm also ready to pivot to John if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $115 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $108 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 110}
