Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit margin of $300,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000) to play with.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's attractive to Bob but also maximizes your profit. Here's a possible approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm offering it at a special price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob. The mention of ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive.
* **Price:**  $1,350,000  is a strong starting point. It gives you a $150,000 profit above your minimum while still leaving Bob with a potential perceived gain.

**Important Considerations**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You have room to negotiate down slightly, but don't go below your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Relationship:**  Consider your long-term relationship with Bob. If it's important to maintain a good relationship, you might be willing to accept a slightly lower offer to ensure a win-win situation.
