Round 2

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I reject Bob's offer. $80 is far too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $80 is way too low. I'm willing to come down to $125, but that's my final offer. If you're serious about buying this product, let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go below my minimum. I'll make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $95 is simply not enough. Let's meet in the middle. How about $110?  This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $110 is closer, but I'm on a tight budget.  How about we split the difference and do $102.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $102.50 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price yet. I'm confident I can get a better deal, so I'll counteroffer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $102.50 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $107.50. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
