"I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to consider that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I understand you're trying to get a good deal.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking we could meet in the middle again, at $92.50. Would that work for you?",92.5,Bob,4,
