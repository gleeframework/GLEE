Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

While I could continue negotiating, Bob is consistently moving towards a middle ground. Accepting his offer of $1,225,000 is a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely."
