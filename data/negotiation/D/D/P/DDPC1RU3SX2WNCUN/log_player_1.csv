"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $140, which is close to the value Bob places on the product but still gives me a decent profit.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer in a positive light, highlighting the value and potential benefit to Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By starting at $140, I create space for potential negotiation and allow Bob to counter if he feels it's too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking for something within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, I'm not desperate to sell. I still have several rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can get a higher price. I'm also confident that John will be a reliable buyer if I need to sell to him, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's first counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $125 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. Let's split the difference and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counter-offer that's closer to his price point. 
* **Emphasizing compromise:** I'm framing this as a compromise,  showing that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintain profit:**  $135 is still above my minimum price of $120, ensuring I make a profit."
