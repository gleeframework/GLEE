"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11000. How about we try to find a compromise at $11000? It's a fair price for the product's value, and I think it's worth considering.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession - I can meet you at $11250. It's a fair price for the product's value, and I think it's worth considering.",11250.0,Alice,7,
