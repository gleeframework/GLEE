"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you is $15000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. After careful consideration, I am unable to accept $9500 for the product. My initial offer was based on the value it holds for you, which is $10000. I believe we can find a middle ground. How about we set the price at $10750? This still leaves a good margin for me while acknowledging the value you see in the product.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10250 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the value I see in the product.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. After reviewing your latest offer, I'm inclined to accept a price closer to my original proposal. Considering the value you place on the product and aiming for mutual satisfaction, how about we settle on $10500 for the product? This allows for a reasonable profit while still being a fair deal for you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
