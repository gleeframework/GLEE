You should reject Alice's offer. $1,100,000 is still above your budget.  You have room to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better price."

I'm offering $900,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and still leaves some room for negotiation."

While $1,050,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price. You can continue to negotiate with Alice to try and get a better price."

I'm offering $950,000 for the product. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us."

Alice is not budging much. You've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like Alice is unwilling to go lower than $1,000,000. It's time to cut your losses and buy the product from John for $800,000. You'll save yourself a significant amount of money and avoid further negotiations."
