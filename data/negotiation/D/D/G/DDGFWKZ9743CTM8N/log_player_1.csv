Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value, but I believe I can't afford such a high price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe that $900,000 is the most I could reasonably pay for this product. I am not willing to go higher than that. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.

Bob seems firmly anchored at $900,000 and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
