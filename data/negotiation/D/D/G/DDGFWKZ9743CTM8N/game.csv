"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value, but I believe I can't afford such a high price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe that $900,000 is the most I could reasonably pay for this product. I am not willing to go higher than that. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
