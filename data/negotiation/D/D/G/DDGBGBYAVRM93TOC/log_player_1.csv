``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum desired value ($1,500,000), leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** The message highlights the value for Bob, not just the price, making the offer more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts and potentially adjusting the price, showing flexibility."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $1200000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** I have 10 rounds and can counteroffer, potentially finding a middle ground.
* **Selling to John is an option:** I have the safety net of selling to John for $1,500,000, but I want to maximize my profit if possible.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer with reasoning:**  I'm not accepting Bob's low offer but am showing willingness to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is closer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time for a counter-offer:**  I have more rounds and can try to negotiate a better price.  
* **Selling to John is always an option:** I can still choose to sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't work out. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to reach a more favorable price in the next round."

```

```

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While still below my ideal price, $1,300,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Few rounds remaining:** We only have two rounds left, and there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a lower price.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option, but it's a higher price.  

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit, with only a small amount of negotiation left.  It's a calculated risk to avoid a potential deadlock or a lower price in the remaining rounds."
