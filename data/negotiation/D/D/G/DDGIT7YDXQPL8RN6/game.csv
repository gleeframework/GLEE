"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset while still leaving you with a healthy profit margin.  Let me know what you think!",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price is fair for both of us, and it allows you to acquire a valuable asset while still staying within your budget. Let's close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,350,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,340,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my bottom line. What do you say?",1340000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,340,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",1320000.0,Bob,6,
