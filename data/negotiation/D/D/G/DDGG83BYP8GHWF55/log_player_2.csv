"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. It's closer to her valuation than mine. I can definitely get a better price, even if it means walking away and buying from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for starting the conversation, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?"", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's opening offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Anchoring:** By presenting $6,000, I'm trying to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range.
* **Polite and Interested:**  Maintaining a positive tone is important for a successful negotiation. I want Alice to know I'm serious but also looking for a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $8,500 is still above my maximum price. I'm willing to negotiate a bit further, but I'm also content with buying from John if we can't reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm proposing a price that splits the difference between her last offer ($8,500) and my previous counteroffer ($6,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still moving the price in my desired direction.
* **Clear Target:** $7,500 is a good target for this stage of the negotiation. It's below John's price and gives me room to negotiate up slightly if needed.
* **Time Constraint:**  With fewer rounds left, I need to be more direct and signal that I'm serious about reaching a deal soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally met my maximum price!  There's no point in rejecting and risking losing the deal. It's a fair price, and I've managed to save some money compared to her initial offer."
