"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This is a good starting point to see how interested Bob is and to give us room to negotiate. I'm confident the product is worth more than that to me, so I'm not selling it to John yet."

Bob is getting closer, but $900,000 is still too low. I'm going to counteroffer again. I'm not going to sell to John yet, as I think I can get a better price from Bob."
