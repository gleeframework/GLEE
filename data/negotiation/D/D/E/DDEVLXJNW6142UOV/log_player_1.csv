"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe is worth a lot to the right person. I'm starting the price at $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not desperate to sell immediately. I believe the product has a higher value and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. There are still 9 rounds left, and I have the option of selling to John for $10,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000 to make this deal happen.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
