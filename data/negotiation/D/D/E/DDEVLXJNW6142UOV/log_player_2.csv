"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe is worth a lot to the right person. I'm starting the price at $15000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. Therefore, it's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to be aggressive in driving the price down.  He's offering $10,000, which is well below Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation. This approach shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying but is also determined to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $12000 to make this deal happen.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. Accepting this offer means Bob gets the product for the price he was willing to pay and avoids the risk of further negotiation. It's a good deal for Bob, and it's likely that further negotiation would only lead to more time and potential dead ends."
