,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?  It's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $115. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm sticking to my offer of $105.  It's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll offer you the product for $112. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  $112 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle again.  I'll offer $108.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow us to close this deal.",108.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $108. I'll meet you halfway again, and offer you the product for $111. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",111.0,Alice,7,
