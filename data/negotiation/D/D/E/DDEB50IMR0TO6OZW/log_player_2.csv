"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his negotiation by offering a price that's closer to his maximum value ($120) but still leaves room for further negotiation.  By offering $105, Bob is signaling that he's serious about buying the product but is also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $115. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While $115 is closer to his ideal price, he can likely still get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer gives him another opportunity to counteroffer and hopefully get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm sticking to my offer of $105.  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his previous offer of $105. He's hoping that Alice will eventually cave and accept his price, as it's still a good deal for her considering the product's value to her.  By reiterating his position and offering a fair price, Bob is showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product but is also willing to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll offer you the product for $112. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money, and $112 is closer to his ideal price but still higher than he'd like to pay.  Rejecting the offer gives him another opportunity to counteroffer and hopefully get the price down further. He's getting closer to his goal of a lower price, and with several rounds left, it's worth continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  $112 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle again.  I'll offer $108.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to be persistent and is proposing a price that's only a few dollars away from Alice's last offer. By offering $108, Bob is showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product but won't be taken advantage of.  He's also highlighting that this is a fair price that will allow them to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $108. I'll meet you halfway again, and offer you the product for $111. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $111. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $111
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the best possible price. While $111 is closer to his target, he's still hoping to save a few more dollars.  Rejecting the offer gives him another opportunity to counteroffer and hopefully close the deal at a price closer to his maximum.  There are still a few rounds left, so continuing the negotiation makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I think we're very close to a deal.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  Let's finalize this and get the product to me."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push to close the deal.  He's increased his offer to $110, which is only $1 more than his previous counteroffer.  This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product and is willing to make a reasonable compromise.  With only a few rounds left, Bob is hoping that Alice will finally accept his offer, as it's still a good deal for her."
