"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140.  It's in great condition and worth a lot to the right person.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
You're aiming to save as much as possible.  $140 is too high, so it makes sense to reject and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit too high for me.  How about $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, I understand you want a lower price.  How about $135?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's still less than what I initially offered.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $135, which is within your budget and a good price considering your goal of saving as much as possible. Accepting this offer is the best strategy."
