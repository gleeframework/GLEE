Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum, Bob. I'll meet you at $11500, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15000. Let's finalize the deal!

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated that $11,500 is her absolute minimum.  Bob has three rounds left and has already rejected Alice's offer at this price point. While he could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will walk away. 

Considering that Bob can buy the product from John for $15,000, accepting Alice's offer at $11,500 is a significantly better deal and secures the product."
