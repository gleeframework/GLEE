,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $9,500?  I'm serious about buying this, and I think this price is fair considering it's worth $10,000 to you.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still firm on getting at least $10,500 for this product. It's a fair compromise considering it's worth $10,000 to you, and I know you're serious about acquiring it.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $10,250? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm still confident this product is worth it to me.",10250.0,Bob,4,
