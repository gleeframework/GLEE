"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my expenses.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I think you'll find it's a fair price.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. I'm really interested in it, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10200 and $9000, which is $9600. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",9600.0,Bob,6,
