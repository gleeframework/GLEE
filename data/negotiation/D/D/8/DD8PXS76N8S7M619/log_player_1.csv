Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a fair offer:**  $130 is significantly above Bob's perceived value of $80, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $130 is still above your minimum of $150, leaving some room for you to accept a counteroffer if needed.
* **It's friendly:** Starting with a positive and friendly message can help create a more cooperative atmosphere for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $115.  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell for more, $110 is still above my minimum and closer to my ideal price.  Accepting Bob's offer is the best choice in this situation."
