"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $80 to both of us, and I believe it could greatly benefit you. I am offering it to you for $95, which includes a special discount. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $15 higher than your maximum budget of $80.  It's too high, and there's room to negotiate.  You'll reject and see if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're starting the negotiation by offering your maximum price of $80. This shows Alice you're serious about buying the product but are sticking to your budget.  It's a fair starting point, and you'll see if Alice is willing to compromise."
