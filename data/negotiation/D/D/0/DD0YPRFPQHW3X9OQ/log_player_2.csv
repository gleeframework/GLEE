Round 2

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

**Explanation:**

Bob is showing flexibility by increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. This demonstrates that he is serious about buying the product but still wants to save money.  Offering $100 keeps the deal within Bob's budget and is likely to be attractive to Alice, given her willingness to drop her price from $110 to $105."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $102 is within Bob's budget and is a significant drop from her initial price.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to John is now high.  At this point, Bob should accept the offer to secure the purchase and save money."
