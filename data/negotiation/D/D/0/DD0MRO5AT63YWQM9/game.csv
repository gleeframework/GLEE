"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset for your business. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $600,000 to make this work.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $600,000 is significantly below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This price still gives you a good deal, while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price.  However, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  I could go up to $700,000. That's a significant investment on my part, but I believe in the value of this product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $700,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too far off from what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000.  This price acknowledges the value you see in the product while ensuring I receive a fair return.  Let's make this happen.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
