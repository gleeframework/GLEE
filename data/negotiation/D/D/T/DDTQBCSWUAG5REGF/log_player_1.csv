"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for the maximum profit.  I know Bob values the product at $8,000, so this is a significant markup.  It's unlikely he'll accept on the first round, but it sets the stage for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $10,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm dropping my price to $9,500. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's value and closer to my minimum. I'm hoping this shows good faith and encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping for a better deal. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit more before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm making a small concession, dropping the price to $9,250.  I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not giving away the farm.  We're getting close to a deal, and I'm optimistic that we can come to an agreement in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has offered $9,000, which is a respectable price. I've been negotiating for a few rounds now, and while I'd love to get closer to my ideal price, I'm running out of time. Accepting this offer ensures I get a good profit, and it's better than selling to John for $10,000 and losing a potential future relationship with Bob."
