# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further since you're still saving money compared to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10,500. I understand that it's a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

It's still worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You're closer to your ideal price, and there's still room for a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. This product is worth a lot to me, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for it. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $11,050. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $11,050 is above your budget of $10,000. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John and save money. Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to lead to a better price for you."
