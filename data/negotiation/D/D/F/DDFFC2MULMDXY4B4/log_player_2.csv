The product is way above your price limit. It's better to try to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm starting with a lowball offer to see how much Alice is willing to budge.  This is a significant discount from her initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation."

Alice is coming down, but $15,000 is still too high. I'll counter with a price closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}

I'm moving closer to my limit, but still leaving some room for Alice to come down a bit. This feels like a fair price given Alice's previous offer."

Alice is getting closer to my limit, but I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can squeeze out a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to offer a price that's right in the middle of my limit and Alice's current offer. This is my final attempt to get the best deal. If Alice rejects this, I'll buy from John."
