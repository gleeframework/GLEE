"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't go as low as $1,200,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, at $1,250,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation. I'm willing to move a bit closer to your offer, but $1,250,000 is cutting it a little too close.  How about $1,280,000?  This is a firm offer, as I have other potential buyers interested at this level.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
