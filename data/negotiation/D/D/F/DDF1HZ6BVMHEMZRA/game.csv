"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value your interest, $750,000 doesn't reflect the true worth of this product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $850,000. This allows for some flexibility while still acknowledging the product's value.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $775,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $775,000 is still below my desired range, I'm willing to compromise further.  How about $825,000? This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs.  Let's reach a final agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $795,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",795000.0,Bob,6,
