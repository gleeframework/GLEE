"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and gauge his initial reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to sell for $9,500. I will reject his offer and try to get a better price.  I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, he will understand that I am serious about getting a fair price for my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $12,000. This is a compromise from my initial price, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a sign of good faith and be willing to meet me halfway."
