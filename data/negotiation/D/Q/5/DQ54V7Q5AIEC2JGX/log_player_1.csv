"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my eagerness to make a deal."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $1,300,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $700,000.  I believe this offer reflects my serious interest in the product while still being financially feasible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still far below both our valuation and John's guaranteed offer. We need to show firmness and push him closer to our range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your persistence. However, the value of this product is substantial, and $700,000 simply doesn't reflect that. I'm willing to make another move and come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than fair."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has significant value, but I also have a budget I need to stick to.  Your last offer was a big jump, so I'm hoping we can find a compromise. Would $800,000 work?  That's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** This is a tough call, but here's the logic:

* **Bob has reached his maximum price:** His message clearly states this is his absolute limit.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome. 
* **$800,000 is a significant profit:** While less than John's offer, it's still a substantial gain compared to Bob's initial offer and shows a successful negotiation on our part.
* **Time is a factor:** We have fewer rounds remaining, and there's no guarantee Bob will stay engaged if we push further. Accepting now secures the deal."
