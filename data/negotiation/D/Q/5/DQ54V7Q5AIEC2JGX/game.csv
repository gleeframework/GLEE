"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident that this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my eagerness to make a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $1,300,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $700,000.  I believe this offer reflects my serious interest in the product while still being financially feasible.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your persistence. However, the value of this product is substantial, and $700,000 simply doesn't reflect that. I'm willing to make another move and come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than fair.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has significant value, but I also have a budget I need to stick to.  Your last offer was a big jump, so I'm hoping we can find a compromise. Would $800,000 work?  That's the absolute highest I can go.",800000.0,Bob,6,
