Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my eagerness to make a deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your persistence. However, the value of this product is substantial, and $700,000 simply doesn't reflect that. I'm willing to make another move and come down to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than fair.
