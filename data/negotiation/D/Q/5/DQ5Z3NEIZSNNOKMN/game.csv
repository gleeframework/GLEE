"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see some flexibility on the price. Can you consider my offer?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium, $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a fair price for both of us. It's a significant discount from my initial offer, but it's still a good deal considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,
