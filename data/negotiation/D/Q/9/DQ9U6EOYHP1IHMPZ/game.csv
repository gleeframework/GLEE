"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to pay right now. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,250,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm hopeful you'll reconsider.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your previous offer, but I'm not willing to sell at $1,250,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,280,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts?",1280000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  I really appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there yet. How about $1,260,000? That's a fair middle ground and I think we can both be happy with that.",1260000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,260,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,280,000, but I'm also keeping in mind that I have another interested buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1,500,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $1,290,000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1290000.0,Alice,7,
