Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,200,000. I would like to propose an alternative price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the product's worth while also aligning with my financial capabilities. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

This still allows me to profit from the sale while acknowledging the value you see in the product. I believe this is a fair compromise and hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
