Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your budget constraints, $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This still allows me to profit from the sale while acknowledging the value you see in the product. I believe this is a fair compromise and hope we can reach an agreement.
