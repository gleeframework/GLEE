Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's slightly above the product's worth to Bob, giving him some room to negotiate.  However, it's not too high that it would immediately deter him from continuing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not under any pressure to accept it immediately.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly higher price. This allows me to try and get a better price while still maintaining a possibility of a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering $125.  This is a small increase from Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.  I believe this price still remains attractive to Bob, while giving me a chance to get closer to my desired price."
