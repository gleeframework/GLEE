# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $18,000. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is well above his budget, and he can get the product for less from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $16,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and he can buy it from John for that price. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice, even if she may come down further."
