Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to me is much higher. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This allows Bob to make a counteroffer, potentially leading to a win-win situation. 
* **Knowing my backup:** I'm aware of John's offer, which gives me a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get closer to my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  I believe there's room for further negotiation with Bob. 
* **John's offer is my safety net:** I can always fall back on selling to John if the negotiation with Bob breaks down.

**Next steps:** I will counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value while still being competitive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it's closer to my minimum. Let me know if you're interested in this compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial $12,000, showing flexibility.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, making my offer seem more attractive. 
* **Still above my minimum:** $11,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring I'm not losing out.
* **Open to discussion:** The message ends by inviting Bob to consider the offer, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $9,500 is a bit low for you, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $10,500 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Even if I accept this offer, there's a chance Bob might be open to increasing it slightly if I express some hesitation.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob entirely, and selling to John might be a more time-consuming process. 

**Next steps:** I'll accept Bob's offer, but I'll try to gauge his willingness to potentially raise the price slightly by expressing some initial reluctance."
