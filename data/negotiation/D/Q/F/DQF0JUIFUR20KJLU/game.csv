,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $140 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $155? It's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $145 is still a bit low for me.  I'm going to offer a final compromise of $150.  This is the lowest I can go while still making a fair profit. What do you say?",150.0,Alice,5,
