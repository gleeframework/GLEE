{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

This offer gives me a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm also being upfront about wanting a deal that benefits both of us.  It's important to keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target price. I'll need to be careful not to push Bob away entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your business, $1,100,000 isn't quite enough for me.  How about $1,150,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be very valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay $1,125,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable with it. I'm going to counteroffer again and try to push for a slightly higher price.  John's offer is a good safety net if this negotiation falls apart."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your efforts. I am willing to pay $1,130,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer meets your needs.

This is getting frustrating. Bob is clearly not willing to budge much further.  I've reached a point where I'm very close to John's offer.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  I'll get a significantly better price, and I won't have to continue this tedious negotiation."
