{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a bit above what Bob thinks the product is worth, but it's below your minimum selling price of $100, so there's room for negotiation.  It also sets a positive tone by mentioning Bob specifically and highlighting the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $85 is a good price for you, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to $90.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $87.50? "", ""product_price"": 87.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $82.50 is a more reasonable price for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $82.5 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price.  I'm willing to give this one more try with a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I get that we're not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go lower than $85.  How about we split the difference and go with $83.75?  This is my final offer, so let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 83.75}
