"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $1,200,000 from John, so he should aim for a price closer to that.  Rejecting the offer opens the opportunity for counteroffers and potential savings."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still gives me a decent profit margin. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's still closer to John's price than Alice's.  Rejecting opens the opportunity for further negotiation and potentially getting a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,075,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm offering the product to you for $1,080,000. This is a compromise that still gives me a decent profit margin. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could try to negotiate further, the price is now very close to his maximum, and he risks losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price.  It's better to secure the deal at a price that's within his budget."
