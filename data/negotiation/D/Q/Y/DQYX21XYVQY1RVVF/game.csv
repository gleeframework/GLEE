"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This gives you a good profit margin while still allowing me to save some money. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still gives me a decent profit margin. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'll offer you $1,075,000. This price allows you a good margin while staying within my budget. What do you say?",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,075,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm offering the product to you for $1,080,000.
