Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000 and I have a guaranteed sale at that price with John, I want to aim higher to maximize potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and we could potentially settle on a price higher than $10,000.
* **Early Bird Incentive:**  By framing the offer as a pre-public sale opportunity, it might make Bob feel like he's getting an exclusive deal and encourage him to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Depending on your risk appetite and how much you know about Bob's negotiation style, you might adjust the initial offer."
