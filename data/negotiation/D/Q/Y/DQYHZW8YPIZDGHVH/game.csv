"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! It's a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $850,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  To be honest, I'm working with a tight budget on this one. Could you do $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're working with a tight budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to compromise again. How about we meet at $825,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, you're tough!  I can go up a little bit, but $825,000 is still a stretch. How about $775,000 and we have a deal?",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $775,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825,000 and $775,000. How about we settle on $800,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,7,
