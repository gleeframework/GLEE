,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. However,  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my maximum budget and the value you've placed on it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still out of my range.  Let's split the difference.  I'm happy to offer $950,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise between our initial positions.",950000.0,Bob,4,
