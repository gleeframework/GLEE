"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really enjoy it. My asking price is $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but lower than my minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Approach:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  The question invites Bob to engage in the negotiation and provides an opportunity to learn more about his willingness to pay."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I'd love to sell, I'm not willing to go below my minimum value of $150 for this product. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a price that's acceptable to both of us.
* **Exploring other options:**  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before resorting to selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you to find a solution.  Let's try $128. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you, given the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 128}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  I'm raising the price only slightly, showing a willingness to compromise without completely sacrificing my desired profit margin.

* **Value Reminder:**  I'm reminding Bob about the value of the product to encourage him to consider the offer seriously.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're finding common ground. Considering the product's value, I think $127 would be a fair price for both of us. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $127 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Limited Negotiation Rounds:** With only four rounds left, I'm concerned that I might not be able to secure a price that is both profitable and agreeable to Bob.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit of $150, eliminating the risk of further negotiation.
* **Time is Money:**  Rather than potentially wasting more time trying to get a few dollars more from Bob, it's more efficient to secure the guaranteed profit from John."
