Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning he wouldn't logically pay more.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum. This makes a deal challenging but not impossible.

**Strategy**

Since there's no ZOPA based on the current valuations, you need to either:

1. **Convince Bob of Higher Value:**  Can you highlight features or benefits that would make the product worth more than $1,200,000 to him?
2. **Accept a Smaller Profit:** Are you willing to make less than your guaranteed $1,500,000 for a quicker sale?

**The Offer**

Given the information, here's a possible approach:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product before I make it available to others. While I have a strong offer on the table, I believe in giving valued contacts the first chance. I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Creates Urgency:**  The message implies you have other interested buyers, even though John's offer matches your minimum.
* **Positions as a Favor:** By framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" you're suggesting Bob is getting preferential treatment.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a price you find acceptable.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator or highly price-sensitive, you might need to adjust your approach.
* **Your Risk Tolerance:** How important is a quick sale? A lower price might guarantee a deal, but a higher price carries more risk."
