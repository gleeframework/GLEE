"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're willing to go up to $105, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. How about we try $115? It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",115.0,Alice,5,
