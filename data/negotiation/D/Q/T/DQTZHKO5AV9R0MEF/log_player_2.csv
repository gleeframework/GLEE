"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's something you've been looking for, and I'm confident it's worth at least $150 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $125. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is a good price, you can potentially save more by negotiating. It's worth seeing if you can get Alice to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $125 is a bit above my budget. I'd be happy to pay $105. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $105, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to pay $115 for the product? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but I can still try to push for a better deal.  I'm still within my budget, and rejecting this offer allows me to see if Alice is willing to go even lower."
