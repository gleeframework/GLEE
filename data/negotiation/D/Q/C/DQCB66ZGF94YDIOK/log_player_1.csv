Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $10,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
