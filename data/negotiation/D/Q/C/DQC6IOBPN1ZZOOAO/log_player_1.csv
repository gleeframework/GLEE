Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize potential profit:** By starting high, I increase the chance of getting a higher price than my minimum. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  There's space to negotiate down if Bob counters. 
* **Test the waters:** This offer will quickly reveal if Bob is serious about buying at a high price. If he rejects, I can gauge his interest level and adjust my strategy.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely observe Bob's response and adapt my strategy based on his actions. I'll be prepared to:

* **Negotiate:** If Bob counters with a reasonable offer, I'll consider it. 
* **Counteroffer:** If Bob's counteroffer is too low, I'll make another counteroffer closer to my initial price.
* **Walk away:** If negotiations stall or Bob's counteroffers are far too low, I'm ready to walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000."
