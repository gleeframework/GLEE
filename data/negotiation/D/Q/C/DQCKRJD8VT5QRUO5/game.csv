"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I believe $1,150,000 is a bit too high.  Considering its value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I'm motivated to sell, I'm also confident in the product's value exceeding your offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while acknowledging the product's worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $1,100,000 is pushing it. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000.  It's a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay and your desire to sell. Let's close the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer, but I'm not quite ready to drop to $1,050,000. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,085,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1085000.0,Alice,5,
