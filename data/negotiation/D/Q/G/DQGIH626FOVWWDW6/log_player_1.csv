*Explanation:*

This offer attempts to create a sense of urgency while also offering a compromise that Bob might find hard to refuse.  We're still significantly above our minimum, and pushing Bob a bit might be the final push for a successful negotiation."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and my previous offer of $11,500. How about $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Explanation:**

While we're above our minimum price and could push for more, Bob is clearly set on a price around $11,000. Accepting his $11,000 offer guarantees a good profit ($3,000 above our minimum) without risking losing the deal entirely by pushing too hard.  It's always possible he walks away if we counter again."
