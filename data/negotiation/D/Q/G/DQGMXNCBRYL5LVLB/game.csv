"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1150000. I believe the product's value to you is even higher than that, considering your initial offer was $1200000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1150000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum. Let's try $1180000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1180000.0,Alice,5,,
