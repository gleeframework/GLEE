Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,500,000. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,750,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to be ambitious with Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:** The $1,750,000 offer tests Bob's willingness to pay a premium. While it's a high price, it leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value *to Bob* to justify the high price. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have some time and flexibility. If you need to sell quickly, a less aggressive approach might be necessary."
