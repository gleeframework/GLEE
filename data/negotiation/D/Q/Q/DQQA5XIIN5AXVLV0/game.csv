"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'd be happy to pay $750,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is significantly below my minimum.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a substantial discount and a very strong offer.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $925,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to go up to $850,000.  This would allow me to acquire the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",850000.0,Bob,4,
