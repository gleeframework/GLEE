"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you offering me this product. However, $180 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product but I can only offer $80 for it right now. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $90. This is a fair price, and it's as high as I can go at the moment. I'm really keen on getting this product.",90.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll sell it to you for $110. This is my best offer so far, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on your offer, Alice.  However, $110 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm really pushing my budget to the limit here, but I can offer $100.  If you're serious about selling, this is my absolute final offer.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really trying to make this work, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll sell it to you for $130. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",130.0,Alice,7,
