"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I think the product is worth a good price, but I'm not comfortable paying $14,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,500. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market price.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,500 is cutting it a little too close for me. How about we split the difference again and settle at $12,250? This ensures we both feel we're getting a reasonable deal.",12250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that $12,250 is the best price for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market price.",11000.0,Bob,6,
