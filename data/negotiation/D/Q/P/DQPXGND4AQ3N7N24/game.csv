"Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let's see if we can make this work.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10,500? This price is still a great value for you, and allows me to get closer to what I need for the sale. Let's work together to make this happen.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $10,200? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal. ",10200.0,Bob,4,
