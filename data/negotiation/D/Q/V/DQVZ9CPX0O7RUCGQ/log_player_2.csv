"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $800,000.  There's no reason to accept it. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There's always a chance she'll come down to a price you're comfortable with. If not, you can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is your best starting point. You're offering the maximum you're willing to pay.  You're essentially saying ""This is my absolute limit, take it or leave it"". If she rejects, you have a backup option with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further. You might be able to get her down closer to your desired price range. If not, you can always go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've already shown Alice your bottom line, so now you need to find a middle ground. Offering $900,000 shows you're serious about buying but still want a good deal. This is a reasonable compromise, and hopefully, Alice will be willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than before, it's still above your comfort zone. You're very close to John's price, so it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice just one more time before committing to John. There's a chance she might come down to a more acceptable price, but if not, you can always go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is your final counteroffer. You've shown flexibility and willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is a reasonable compromise, and it's still closer to your budget than Alice's latest offer. If Alice rejects this offer, you're ready to go with John's deal."
