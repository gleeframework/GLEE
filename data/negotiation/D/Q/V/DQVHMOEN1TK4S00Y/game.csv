,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my budget. How about $75? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $70 and $80.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $75 is still too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on my last offer.  How about $82.50? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit out of my budget. How about $78? I'm trying to be fair, but I really need to save some money on this purchase.",78.0,Bob,6,
