"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's value of $8,000.  There's room for negotiation.  Bob can try to get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her value for the product.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate, while also showing Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his ideal price point.  There's still room for further negotiation. Bob can try to get an even lower price in the next round, potentially closer to his $10,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is closer to our middle ground.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is strategically increasing his offer slightly, showing he's willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to his target. This keeps the negotiation moving forward without risking too much, as his offer remains below the potential purchase price from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is only $1,000 above Bob's ideal price of $10,000. At this point, it's a good deal for Bob and allows him to save a significant amount compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation is possible, there's a risk that Alice might become inflexible or the negotiations might stall.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a decent price and avoids any potential complications."
