"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $14000. This is an exceptional value considering its worth to you is $15000. I believe this offer strikes a fair balance between the value we receive and the value you perceive in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $14,000.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's value to me and your potential profit, I'm willing to offer $12,500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. How about we set the price at $13500? This still leaves a significant profit margin for us while offering you a price closer to what you're comfortable with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still better than John's:**  $13,500 is cheaper than $15,000.
* **Alice is showing willingness to negotiate:**  She's moved from $14,000 to $13,500, indicating a potential for further compromise. However, it's unlikely she'll go much lower, as she still wants a profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice sticking to her $13,500 or even increasing it.  Accepting guarantees a price lower than John's and within Bob's budget."
