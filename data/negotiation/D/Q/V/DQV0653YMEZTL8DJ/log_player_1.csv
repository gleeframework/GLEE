{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a unique item that I believe will be of great value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's higher than your minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message that emphasizes the value of the product, encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer.  This strategy aims to get the negotiation going and potentially lead to a higher sale price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking for something within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it's still worth trying to negotiate a bit higher.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. Considering the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $11000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is higher than John's offer of $10,000. It's also closer to your desired price of $12,500. Accepting this offer is the best choice, as it secures a better price for you than selling to John."
