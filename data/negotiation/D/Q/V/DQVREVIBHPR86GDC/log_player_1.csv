Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of your product, $1500000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for it, which is still a fair price considering the product's potential. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
