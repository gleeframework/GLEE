"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $7,500 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a great starting point, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less.  Would you be willing to do $7,000? "", ""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  Offering $7,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation if Alice is willing to budge. This counteroffer also demonstrates that Bob is serious about buying the product, but wants a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get it for a bit less, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $7,250 is a good compromise, and it's a significant discount from the original $8,000.  While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject the counteroffer and the negotiations could go on for too long.  Accepting the offer at $7,250 saves Bob $750 and is a good deal given the time constraint and the possibility of needing to buy from John at $8,000."
