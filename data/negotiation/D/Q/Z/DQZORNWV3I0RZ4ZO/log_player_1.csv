"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects the offer. It's important to remember that my minimum acceptable price is $8,000, as selling to John guarantees that much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is still above my minimum price, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While it's closer, I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round. There are still several rounds remaining, so I'm not in a rush to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is closer to my minimum price and signals that I'm getting more serious about making a deal with Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.
