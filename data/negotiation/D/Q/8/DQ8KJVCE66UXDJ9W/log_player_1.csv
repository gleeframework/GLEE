Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, her goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob accepts:
    * Bob gets the product for $50,000 less than its worth to him.
    * Alice makes $150,000 more than selling to John.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The message leaves room for negotiation. If Bob counters, Alice can assess and decide if she wants to go lower, ultimately ensuring she gets at least $1,200,000."
