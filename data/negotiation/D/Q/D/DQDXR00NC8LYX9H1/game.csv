"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really appreciate its unique features and benefits. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $10000, as it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I think it's still a great value for you.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your minimum price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll offer $10500. Can you consider this compromise?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $10500. I'm willing to make one last compromise, so I'll offer it to you for $11250. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11250.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're making one last compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10000. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget. I'll offer $10800. Can you consider this final compromise?",10800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're still willing to make a compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10800. I'll make one last offer, and that's $11500. This is the absolute lowest price I can accept, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",11500.0,Alice,9,
