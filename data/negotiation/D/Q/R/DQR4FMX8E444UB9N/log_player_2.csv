"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $9,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit to $8250.  It's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate or by buying from John.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation."
