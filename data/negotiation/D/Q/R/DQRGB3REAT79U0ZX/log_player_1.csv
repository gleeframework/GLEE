"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired outcome. This leaves room for concessions and signals that you value the product highly. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:**  Knowing the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, a starting point closer to his valuation increases the chance he'll engage seriously.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** The $1,300,000 offer leaves a $200,000 potential profit for Bob, giving him an incentive to negotiate rather than immediately reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is tempting, it's significantly lower than our target and his perceived value of the product. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about the product's worth and are willing to negotiate further.  We still have several rounds left, and walking away now with the guaranteed $800,000 from John would be leaving a lot of potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential for you.  I could consider a price of $1,150,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the true value of this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession:**  We've lowered our price by $150,000 from our initial offer, showing Bob that we're willing to move towards a deal.
* **Still Above Our Minimum:** The $1,150,000 offer is comfortably above our $800,000 minimum and keeps us in a profitable position.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value *to Bob*, we reinforce the idea that this price is a compromise, not a reflection of low worth. 
* **Urgency (Implied):**  While not stated directly, moving down to this price level implies we're getting closer to a point where John's offer might become more appealing if Bob doesn't engage seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,025,000 is a significant profit over our $800,000 minimum and a good return on the product's value.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":**  Bob's framing suggests this is likely close to his upper limit, and pushing further risks souring the deal.
* **Time Value:** While we have rounds remaining, securing a deal now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or us needing to settle for John's lower price."
