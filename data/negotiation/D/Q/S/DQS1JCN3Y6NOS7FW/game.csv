"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not able to go that low.  How about we split the difference at $925,000? It's a fair price for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your target.  How about we settle at $880,000?  It's a significant step from my previous offer and seems like a fair compromise.",880000.0,Bob,4,
