# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $850000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $775000. This is a fair compromise considering its rarity and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my desired price range and is a significant reduction from her initial offer.  It's still within my budget and a better deal than buying from John. Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice."
