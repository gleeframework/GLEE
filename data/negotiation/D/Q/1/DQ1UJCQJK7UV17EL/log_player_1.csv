Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price that's 50% higher than my minimum value. This gives me some room to negotiate, but it's still a significant amount. I'm hoping Bob will find the product valuable enough to pay a good price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is a decent offer, I'm not willing to settle for it yet. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $14,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise, but also shows that I'm still confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now only $500 less than my last counteroffer, and closer to my desired price.  At this point, it seems more likely that we'll get stuck in a stalemate.  Selling to Bob for $13,500 is a better option than risking getting a lower price or ending up selling to John for $10,000."
