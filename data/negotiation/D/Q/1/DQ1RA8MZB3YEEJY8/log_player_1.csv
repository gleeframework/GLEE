Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get as close to John's offer as possible. If Bob rejects, we can negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to John's offer of $100. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering at $105. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and still higher than my minimum price. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is getting too close to my minimum price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, it's not worth risking losing a sale to John for a slightly higher price. I'm going to sell to John for $100."
