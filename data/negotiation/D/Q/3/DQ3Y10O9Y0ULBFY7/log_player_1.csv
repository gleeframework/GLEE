I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not going to settle for it right away.  I'll make a counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $17,500. This is a compromise, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to go higher than $14,500. Since John is willing to buy the product for $15,000, it's more profitable for me to sell to John."
