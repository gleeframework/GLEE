"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $2000000. I'm willing to pay $1500000, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price or lower?",1500000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $1500000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1750000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1600000. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much value.

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere, but I'm willing to make one more push. I'm willing to pay $1550000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. Can you meet me here?",1550000.0,Bob,6,,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1550000.

"I'm not willing to pay $1625000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1600000. I think this is a fair price, considering I've already made several concessions. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options.",1600000.0,Bob,8,,

"I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1600000. I can offer it to you for $1625000 one more time. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1625000.0,Alice,9,,
