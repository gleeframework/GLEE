This offer aims to maximize profit while leaving room for negotiation.  It's a significant markup from the minimum you're willing to accept, but it's still a good deal for Bob since it's less than what the product is worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm going to reject the offer and try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not comfortable with his offer.  To avoid further negotiation, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. It's a guaranteed sale and meets my minimum requirement."
