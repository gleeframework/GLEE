Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it. What do you think?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing interest, his offer is getting too far away from John's guaranteed offer. It's unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer beyond this point, and further negotiation risks losing both deals. Taking John's offer at $800,000 is the safer and more profitable option."
