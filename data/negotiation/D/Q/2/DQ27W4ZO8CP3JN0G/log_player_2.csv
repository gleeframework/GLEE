"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is looking to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm really interested in this product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you consider $10,500? This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $11,500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy owning this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for Bob. At this point, it's worth accepting the offer. Here's why:

* **Lower than John's price:** $11,000 is less than the $12,000 John is asking, so Bob is getting a better price.
* **Negotiation risk:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to Alice raising the price again or even walking away. There's a chance that Bob could end up paying more than $11,000 if he keeps rejecting offers.
* **Value for Bob:**  While Bob wants to save money, the product is clearly worth something to him.  At $11,000, he's getting a good deal and can still enjoy the product within his budget."
