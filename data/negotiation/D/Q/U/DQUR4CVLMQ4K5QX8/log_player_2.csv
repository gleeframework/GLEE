"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling you this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really like it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is less than the product's worth to Alice, you know you can get it for $80 from John.  You should reject this offer and try to get a better deal."
