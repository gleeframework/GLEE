"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  I'm serious about buying this, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
