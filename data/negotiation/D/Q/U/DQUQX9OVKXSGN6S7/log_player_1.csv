Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need a bit more to make this work for me. How about $1,350,000? It's still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a bit more, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $1,300,000 is a good price and I'm not sure if I can get a better offer in the remaining rounds. It's also worth noting that John is only offering $1,200,000."
