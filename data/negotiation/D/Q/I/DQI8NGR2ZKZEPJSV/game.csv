"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm open to hearing your thoughts, but I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $950,000? I appreciate your understanding.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $1,100,000? This leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your proposal, Alice. While I understand your position, I'm still looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $1,050,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
