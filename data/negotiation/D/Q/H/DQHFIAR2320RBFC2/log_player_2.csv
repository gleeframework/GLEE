"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  $75 is a good starting point, but you might be able to get it for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}
``` 

I'm offering $50 for the product. This is a significant discount from Alice's original price, and it gives her some room to negotiate if she wants to. I'm hoping she'll accept, but I'm prepared to go back and forth a few more rounds if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
$60 is a good deal considering my maximum is $150 and I'm already in the third round. It's worth accepting to avoid potentially going back and forth with Alice for more rounds."
