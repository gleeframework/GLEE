"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to settle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you can consider it.",8500.0,Alice,5,
