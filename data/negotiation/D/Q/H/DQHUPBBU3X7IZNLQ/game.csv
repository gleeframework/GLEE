"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to reach an agreement. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $725,000?  This shows I'm willing to move closer to your price.",725000.0,Bob,4,
