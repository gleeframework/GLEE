,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away feeling satisfied.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000. I think that's a fair price for the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
