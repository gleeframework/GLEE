"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I think you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better.  You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,500,000, so there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you might encourage her to come down to a price closer to her own valuation of $1,200,000."
