# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. While the product seems great, I'm aiming to stay under $11,000. Would you be willing to consider $10,500? "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise and fits within Bob's budget. It's a better deal than buying from John and offers a good chance of closing the deal.  Bob is willing to accept this offer to save money and secure the product."
