Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming High:** Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, we can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Strategic Margin:**  The offer of $1,450,000 provides a significant potential profit margin of $250,000 if Bob accepts.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message leaves room for negotiation. If Bob counters, we can adjust downwards, knowing our bottom line is covered by John's offer."
