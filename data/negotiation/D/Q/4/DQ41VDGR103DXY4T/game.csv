,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1800000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than what I was initially hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1600000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1600000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to increase my offer to $1400000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll consider it.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I can meet you at $1550000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget limit. While I appreciate your offer of $1550000, I'm only able to go up to $1500000.  This would be my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've thought about it, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $1500000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'd like to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal - I'll include a complimentary service that's worth $50000. So, the total value you'll be getting is $1550000. Is this a deal you'd be interested in?",1500000.0,Alice,7,
