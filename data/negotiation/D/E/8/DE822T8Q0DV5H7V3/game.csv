"While I appreciate the offer, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 was a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $14,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $12,000?  That would be a good compromise for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $12,000, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
