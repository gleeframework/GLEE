"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However,  $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $2,000,000 for this round. This is a significant reduction on my initial offer, reflecting my willingness to find common ground.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. However, there's still a gap between our valuations. I can offer $1,250,000.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
