"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, I need to stay above $15,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Would you be willing to consider $16,000? It's still a significant saving compared to my initial price, and we're getting closer to a deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $14,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay at least at $15,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's try $15,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
