"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to make a serious offer to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $1,320,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.
