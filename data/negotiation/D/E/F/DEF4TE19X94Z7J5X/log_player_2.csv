"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is under your $1,000,000 limit, you can do better.  Rejecting her offer might lead to a counter-offer with a lower price closer to her $800,000 valuation."
