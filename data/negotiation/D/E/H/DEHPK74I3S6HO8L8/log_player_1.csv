Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $120 is a good offer,  I'm looking for a little closer to my initial price. How about $135? That would be a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. How about $125? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $125.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price,  it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  $125 is still a good profit for me, and it's better than selling to John for $100."
