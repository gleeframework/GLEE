"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. To be frank, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can go. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. However, $18,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is a significant purchase, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. While I can't accept $12,000, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While $16,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about we settle at $13,500?  I think that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",13500.0,Bob,6,
