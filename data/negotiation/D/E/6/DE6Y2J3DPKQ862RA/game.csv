"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1000000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $900000. It's a fair price considering the value this product holds. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to go up to $750000 for the product.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can close this deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
