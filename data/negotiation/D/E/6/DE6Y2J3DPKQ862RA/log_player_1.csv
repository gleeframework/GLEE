{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident this product will be highly valuable to you.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1000000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob, or I have the option to sell to John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering the value this product holds. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to go up to $750000 for the product.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm choosing to sell to John for $800,000.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable value.  It's better to guarantee a sale at $800,000 rather than risk further negotiation and potentially getting less or even no deal at all."
