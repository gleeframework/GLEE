Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would you be able to lower the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This would be a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 17000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I still feel strongly about keeping the cost under $10,000. Would you be open to discussing other ways we could come to an agreement without me exceeding my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm to his $10,000 valuation and even trying to negotiate further down. While it's tempting to try and salvage the deal, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that he'll significantly increase his offer.  It's time to apply more pressure and highlight the potential loss of the deal for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm afraid $9,500 is simply too low for me to consider. This product has garnered significant interest from other potential buyers.  I'm willing to come down slightly more to $16,000, but this is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll need to explore those other opportunities."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I truly appreciate your product, but unfortunately, I cannot exceed $10,000. Could we perhaps discuss a payment plan or some form of financing option that might make it feasible for me to acquire the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob remains fixated on his $10,000 limit and is now suggesting alternative payment methods. This indicates he's unlikely to budge on price. Accepting a payment plan introduces complexity and risk for you.  You've given Bob ample opportunity to meet you closer to your desired price.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
