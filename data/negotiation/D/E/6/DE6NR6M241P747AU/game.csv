"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $10,000. Would you be able to lower the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This would be a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I still feel strongly about keeping the cost under $10,000. Would you be open to discussing other ways we could come to an agreement without me exceeding my budget?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm afraid $9,500 is simply too low for me to consider. This product has garnered significant interest from other potential buyers.  I'm willing to come down slightly more to $16,000, but this is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll need to explore those other opportunities.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your response. I truly appreciate your product, but unfortunately, I cannot exceed $10,000. Could we perhaps discuss a payment plan or some form of financing option that might make it feasible for me to acquire the product?",10000.0,Bob,6,
