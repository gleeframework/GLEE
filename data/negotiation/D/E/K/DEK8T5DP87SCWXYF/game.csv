,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's make this happen!",10000.0,Alice,5,
