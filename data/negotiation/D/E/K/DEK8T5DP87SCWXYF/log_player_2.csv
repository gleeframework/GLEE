"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still above his maximum budget of $8,000.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above his absolute maximum. This strategy aims to get the negotiation moving while showing a willingness to compromise. It's likely Alice will reject this offer, but it will allow Bob to gauge her flexibility and potentially set the stage for a more agreeable price in the next rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,250 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget of $8,000.  He should reject this offer and continue negotiating to try and get a lower price. There are still rounds left, and there's potential to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again pushing the negotiation further, aiming for a price closer to his limit while emphasizing this is his final offer. This strategy puts pressure on Alice, potentially prompting her to accept or make a counteroffer closer to Bob's desired price.  If she rejects, Bob is ready to consider John's offer, making the negotiation more serious for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $10,000 is tempting, it's still above his desired price. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a price closer to his budget.  If Alice rejects his next counteroffer, he can always fall back on John's offer. There are still rounds left, and there's potential to save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm prepared to pay $9,500 for the product. This is my final offer before I explore other options. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is pushing the negotiation closer to his limit, but still leaving room for compromise. By stating it's his final offer before exploring other options, he's putting pressure on Alice to accept or make a counteroffer closer to his target price.  He's showing flexibility while also emphasizing that he's not afraid to walk away if the deal isn't favorable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that. However, $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $9,750. It's a small difference, but it's important for me.  This is a very good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,750 is tempting, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. He is very close to his desired price point.  There are still a few rounds left, and it's worth pushing for a lower price. If Alice rejects his next counteroffer, he can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,750 is still a bit more than I can afford. Let's split the difference and close the deal at $9,625. This is my final offer before I explore other options. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9625}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push, proposing a compromise that's almost halfway between his previous offer and Alice's. This shows his willingness to meet halfway while also leaving room for a potential counteroffer from Alice if she's still not satisfied. Emphasizing it's his final offer before exploring other options puts pressure on Alice to accept or make a final counteroffer."
