Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm going to start high, knowing that I can always lower the price if needed. This also gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. If he rejects, I can always go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $11,500. This is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, this is attractive enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not high enough.  John is offering my minimum, and I'm confident I can get that price, so I'm going to sell to John."
