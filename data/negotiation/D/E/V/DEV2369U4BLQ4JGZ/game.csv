"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,750?  That's a significant step from my initial offer and meets you closer to your desired price.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,125? This would allow us to both walk away with a reasonable deal. What do you think?",10125.0,Alice,5,
