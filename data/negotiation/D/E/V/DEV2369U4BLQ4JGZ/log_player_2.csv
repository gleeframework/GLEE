Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is slowly lowering her price, the difference between her offer ($10,125) and John's price ($10,000) is now quite small. Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of the price not going down enough to be worthwhile, and it also costs time. At this point, buying from John for $10,000 is the most logical decision to ensure you get the product at the best possible price."
