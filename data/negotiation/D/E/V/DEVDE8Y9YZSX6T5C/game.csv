"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,250,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, and I'm still very interested in this product. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is my final offer before I consider other options.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, but I have to say, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to go much lower than this.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
