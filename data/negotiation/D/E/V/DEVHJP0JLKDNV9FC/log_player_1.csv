Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $14,000. This is a good starting point because:

* It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000, giving him room to negotiate.
* It's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, allowing me to potentially make a profit.

I'm hoping Bob will counter-offer, allowing us to find a price we both agree on. If he doesn't, I can always fall back on selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm offering $12,000 for the product.  This is a compromise:

* It's significantly higher than Bob's last offer of $10,000, but lower than my original offer of $14,000. 
* It's still a decent profit for me, as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.

I believe this is a fair counteroffer that gives Bob a chance to negotiate without me having to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with it.  I will counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to offer $11,500. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it's a significant step closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this is enough to finally reach a deal with Bob."
