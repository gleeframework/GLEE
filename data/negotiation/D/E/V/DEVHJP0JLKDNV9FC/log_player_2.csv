"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  There's a chance Bob can get closer to his desired price or even force Alice to lower her price to $10,000, making the deal with John unnecessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to maximize his savings.  He knows the product is worth $10,000 to him, so he's offering the minimum price possible. This is a bold move, but it shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting the best deal and is willing to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still not the best deal. Bob can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice. There's a chance she might be willing to come down further, especially since she rejected his initial counteroffer.  Rejecting again allows Bob to maintain pressure and see if he can get even closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  He's now offering a price that is a little higher than his own valuation but lower than Alice's latest offer. This is a compromise that shows Bob is willing to meet Alice halfway but still wants to get the best deal possible. He's hoping Alice will see this as a good compromise and accept, but he's still prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is only $1,500 more than Bob's maximum budget. While he would prefer to pay less, continuing to negotiate carries a risk.  Alice has shown she is willing to negotiate, but also firm in her price. Another round of negotiation could potentially push Alice closer to $11,000, but it also risks her walking away completely, forcing Bob to buy from John for $10,000. 

Given the risk of losing the deal altogether, Bob is better off accepting Alice's offer. He gets the product he wants for a price that is within his budget, and he avoids the potential for a breakdown in negotiations."
