"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",150.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it, given the value I place on it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that $150 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really only able to go up to $95 at this point. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $95, which would be $102.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $102.50 is still a bit too much for me. I'm really only able to go up to $100. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",100.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to give you a small concession and offer it to you for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,7,
