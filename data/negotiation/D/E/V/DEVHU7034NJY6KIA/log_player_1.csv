Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you and believe this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible without pushing him away. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially leading to an even higher final price.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, we have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000. This offer prioritizes maximizing potential profit while still ensuring a sale."
