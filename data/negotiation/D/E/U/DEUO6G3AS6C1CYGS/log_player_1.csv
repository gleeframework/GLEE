Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I am also confident that the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, so I am not willing to sell it for less than that. However, I want to maximize my profit and am willing to negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,400,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is a good compromise.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a significant profit for me, and it's important to keep in mind that we only have 10 rounds. Accepting his offer ensures I secure a sale that is well above my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure I can push for much more."
