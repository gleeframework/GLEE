Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}

This counteroffer is a slight increase from my previous offer, but still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground that both of us can accept. By offering a price just below $900,000, I'm indicating that I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm not willing to pay an exorbitant amount."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $915,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. We've established a negotiation range and I'm confident that I can get a better deal by continuing to counteroffer.  Buying from John at this point would be too costly, so I'll keep trying to reach an agreement with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $912,500 is still higher than the product's worth to her, but it's closer to my desired price and within my budget. With only two rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice and having to buy from John at $1,000,000 is too high.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product within my budget and saves me some money."
