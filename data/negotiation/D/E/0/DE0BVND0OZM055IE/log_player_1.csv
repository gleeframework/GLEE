Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob a reason to negotiate, but it's still within a range where he might find it worthwhile to buy.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate downwards if needed, while still securing a profit.

**Why this strategy?**

This strategy aims to maximize your earnings while minimizing the risk of losing the sale.  Here's why:

* **Negotiation is key:**  A starting price higher than Bob's value encourages him to counteroffer, giving you a chance to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Flexibility:** You can adjust the price based on Bob's counteroffers, ensuring you get the best possible price while still being willing to accept John's offer as a backup.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is a respectable price, it's still below what I'd like to get for the product.  I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, especially since I have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is still a good price for Bob, as it's lower than my minimum and closer to his initial offer.  This gives me a chance to see if he's willing to compromise a bit more without risking a complete breakdown of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $13,200 isn't a terrible price, it's getting closer to the point where the negotiation becomes more stressful than it's worth.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price that's much closer to my ideal value. It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing."
