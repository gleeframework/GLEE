"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is higher than both your maximum price and her product's value. There's room for negotiation. You should aim for a price closer to $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer (in this case, $60 less) can help gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially lead to a larger discount. Even if she rejects it, it sets the stage for negotiation within a range more favorable to you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not comfortable with $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $160. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to your desired price, $160 is still above your target and what John offers. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $140?  That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're aiming for a price closer to $150. Offering $140 keeps the negotiation moving while staying below your maximum and closer to Alice's value of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair compromise, but I'm not willing to go down to $140. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $155. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down considerably, and $155 is only slightly above John's price. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome, and you risk losing the opportunity to buy from Alice altogether."
