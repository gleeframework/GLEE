**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is selling the product for $9,500, while John wants $10,000. 
* **It's within your budget:** The product is worth $10,000 to you, and Alice's offer is below that.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $500 compared to buying from John."
