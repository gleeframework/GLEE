"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:** Since Bob is willing to pay a maximum of $150, and John is offering the product at that price, it makes sense to buy from John right away. There's no benefit to negotiating with Alice, as the best possible outcome is buying the product for the same price."
