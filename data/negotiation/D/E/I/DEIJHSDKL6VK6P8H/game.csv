"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is closer to my maximum. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, given my valuation and your need to sell.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me and your valuation. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the potential value of the product to me. Let's try to find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer a price of $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me and your valuation. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high. I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  This is a substantial increase from my last offer, and I believe it reflects the potential value of this product. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer a price of $1,025,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me and your valuation. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,025,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer a final price of $975,000.
