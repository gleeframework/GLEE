"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is around $1,500,000, but I'm willing to make a compromise to reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I believe the product's value is significantly higher than your offer reflects.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you believe the product's value is higher, but I still think $1,150,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to meet your price. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can we meet at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
