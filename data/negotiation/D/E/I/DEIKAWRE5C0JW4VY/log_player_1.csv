Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a much lower price. How about we start around $600,000?

Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still quite a stretch for me. I'm serious about buying, but I need to see a price closer to my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. Your product is definitely valuable, but to be honest, $1,000,000 is pushing the limits of what I can justify spending. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? That's a substantial offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you're agreeable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
