"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a much lower price. How about we start around $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $600,000 is significantly lower than my asking price, I'm willing to negotiate further.  How about $1,200,000? This is a price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit and acknowledges the value you place on the product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,200,000 is still quite a stretch for me. I'm serious about buying, but I need to see a price closer to my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. I'm confident this offer provides a good value for you, while still allowing me to achieve a reasonable profit. Let's work together to make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. Your product is definitely valuable, but to be honest, $1,000,000 is pushing the limits of what I can justify spending. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? That's a substantial offer, and I'm ready to close the deal today if you're agreeable.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However,  $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's split the difference and settle on $925,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good outcome.  What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further. To be completely transparent, I do have another offer on the table, and to make a deal with you work, I'd need the price to be right. Would you be willing to consider $875,000? That's a firm offer from me, and I think it's more than fair considering the circumstances.",875000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have other offers, but I believe this product is worth more than what you're offering. To make this deal work, I'm willing to go down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and allows me to still achieve a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal now before it's too late.",900000.0,Alice,9,
