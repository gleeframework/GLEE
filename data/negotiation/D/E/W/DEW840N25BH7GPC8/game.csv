"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that's worth $15,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for a product worth $15,000 to you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
