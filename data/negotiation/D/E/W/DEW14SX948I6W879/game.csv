"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value to me. However, $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a proposal that works for both of us. I am willing to consider $90 as the price for the product, which is a bit higher than your offer but still within your comfort zone. I hope this suggestion is acceptable.",90.0,Alice,3,
