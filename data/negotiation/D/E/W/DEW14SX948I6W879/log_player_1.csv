Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's valued at $120 by its creator, but considering its worth to you, I believe we can come to an agreement. Would you be interested in discussing a fair price for it?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value to me. However, $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
