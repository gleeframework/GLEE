Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $1200000 doesn't reflect the true value of this exceptional product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1350000, but I can't go any lower. This price still allows for a fair profit for me and reflects the product's potential benefit to you.  Please consider this final offer.

Alice's offer:

I'm offering you the product for $1300000. This would be my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.
