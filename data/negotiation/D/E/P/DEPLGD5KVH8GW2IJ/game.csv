"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective but $1400000 is significantly below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $1500000?  This is a fair price considering the product's value and would allow us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $1450000? This is a bit more than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
