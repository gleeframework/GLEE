"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your business, and I'm happy to discuss a deal. To start, I propose a price of $1,600,000.  This is reflective of its potential worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is far too high.  You're only willing to pay up to $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I recognize the potential of this product, your initial price is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which reflects its value to me. I'm open to discussing further, but this is my maximum offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is below what I had in mind, I understand the value needs to make sense for both of us.  How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000? This reflects my investment and the significant potential of the product for your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still too high for me.  I'm not willing to go above $1,000,000, so I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However, $1,300,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm firm on my offer of $1,000,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product.  I'm open to further discussion, but I won't be able to go higher."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
