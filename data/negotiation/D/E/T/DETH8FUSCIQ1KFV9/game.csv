"Alice, while I recognize the potential of this product, your initial price is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which reflects its value to me. I'm open to discussing further, but this is my maximum offer.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is below what I had in mind, I understand the value needs to make sense for both of us.  How about we meet halfway at $1,300,000? This reflects my investment and the significant potential of the product for your business.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However, $1,300,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm firm on my offer of $1,000,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product.  I'm open to further discussion, but I won't be able to go higher.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
