Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for a special price of $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:** I've chosen $12,000 as the offer price. This is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for potential negotiation. 
* **Message:** I've included a friendly message that emphasizes the value of the product and the potential for a good deal for Bob. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm open to negotiation if Bob counters with a lower price, but my goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** I'm attempting to sell the product for a higher price than Bob's perceived value while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Avoid a loss:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, I'm guaranteed to sell the product to John for my minimum acceptable price."
