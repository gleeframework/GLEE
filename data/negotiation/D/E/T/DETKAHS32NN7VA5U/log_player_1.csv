Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I think it would be a valuable asset to you, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed $12,000 offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below your absolute minimum ($12,000) leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate a price that's still very profitable for you.
* **Psychological Pricing:** $11,999 feels significantly cheaper than $12,000, potentially making it more appealing to Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still having John as a reliable backup."
