Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's something you'll value greatly, so I'm offering it to you for $120 before I make it available to others."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $120 gives you a significant profit margin while still being attractive to Bob (he saves $30 from his perceived value). 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, maximizing profit on the first sale is ideal. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a price Bob is likely to accept and a price that yields a high profit for you."
