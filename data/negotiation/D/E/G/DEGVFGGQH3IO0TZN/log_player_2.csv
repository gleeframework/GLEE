# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget of $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation. I'll reject her offer and try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the research I've done. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $787500. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer $812500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a lower price, Alice's offer of $812,500 is getting close to my initial counter-offer of $750,000.  Further negotiation might be possible, but it's unlikely she'll budge much further.  Accepting this offer saves me a significant amount compared to buying from John and ensures I get the product."
