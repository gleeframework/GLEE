Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's closer to Bob's perceived value of $15,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and ensures I make a profit above my minimum of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and I'd rather secure the sale than risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal."
