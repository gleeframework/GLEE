"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to split the difference between his maximum price ($120) and Alice's desired price ($100). Offering $105 shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice needs a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $115 is still higher than Bob's desired price.  While there are only 7 rounds left,  Bob can still potentially get a better deal by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer. There is still a $5 difference between Alice's offer and Bob's maximum price, so there is room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again trying to split the difference.  He's raised his offer from $105 to $110, showing he's willing to compromise but is still trying to save money.  This counteroffer gives Alice a price closer to her desired price but remains within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $112.5 is very close to Bob's maximum price of $120, and the negotiation is down to the wire with only 5 rounds left. While Bob can still make another counteroffer, there's a risk that Alice will keep rejecting, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer guarantees Bob gets the product and saves $7.5 compared to buying from John."
