Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still allows room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and what his upper limit might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would have preferred a slightly higher price,  $13,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly better than selling to John for $10,000, and I'm confident I won't get a better offer from Bob."
