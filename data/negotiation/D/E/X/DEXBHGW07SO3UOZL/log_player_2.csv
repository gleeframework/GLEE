``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $150. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best option. Bob can then purchase the product from John for $150, which is still within his budget."
