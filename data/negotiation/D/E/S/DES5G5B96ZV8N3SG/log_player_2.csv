"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is way over his budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8000 is your budget, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10000, which is still a great deal for you. I'm confident you'll find the product valuable enough to be worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While $10,000 is closer to his budget, he can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  He should aim to stay under $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford. I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9500, which is still a good deal for both of us. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $9,500 is closer to his target of $8,000, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's already rejected $9,000 and is willing to pay $8,000 for the product from John, so there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,500 is still a little too high. My absolute maximum is $9,000. If you can meet me there, we have a deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $9500, Bob. I've already met you halfway and I think it's a fair price for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at $9500, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice is refusing to budge on her price, and Bob has already rejected her offer twice in a row.  He's reached his maximum price point and is willing to pay $8,000 to John.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks wasting time and potentially losing the opportunity to buy from John."
