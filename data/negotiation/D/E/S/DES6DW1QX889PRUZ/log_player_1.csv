Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $950,000, reflecting its true worth.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Knowing John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, Alice aims to get as close to that as possible from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **High Value Perception:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""exclusive"" and ""unique"" nature to justify the high price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but the message aims to create a sense of potential loss if he misses out. 

This strategy aims to either:

1. **Secure a high sale with Bob:** Ideally, Bob sees the value and accepts the $950,000.
2. **Set the stage for negotiation:**  Bob might counter-offer, allowing Alice to potentially settle somewhere above John's guaranteed offer.

This approach maximizes Alice's potential earnings while still leaving a possibility of a successful sale to Bob."
