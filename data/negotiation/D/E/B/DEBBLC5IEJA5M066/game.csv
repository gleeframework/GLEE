"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me.  I'm willing to offer you $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. I'm proposing $850,000. This price still leaves significant value for you, and allows me to get closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your valuation, but I need something more reasonable for me. How about $700,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my desired price. However, $700,000 still falls short of what I need. Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $775,000. This is a fair compromise, giving you a substantial saving compared to your initial valuation and allowing me to get closer to my desired price.",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm willing to go up to $725,000 to close this deal. It's a strong offer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",725000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're very close. I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to my minimum price.  I'm offering you the product for $750,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.  Let's settle this deal.",750000.0,Alice,7,
