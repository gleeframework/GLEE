"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $9,000 is a bit lower than what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
