Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,000,000 is higher than Bob's $800,000 valuation, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  It's still above your minimum of $1,200,000, meaning you'd be making a profit if Bob accepts.
* **It leaves room for bargaining:** This price allows for potential counteroffers and negotiation without immediately triggering your backup plan of selling to John. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly to $950,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't settle for a price too far below my desired range. It's a middle ground that might be enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $920,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum value. I'll counteroffer again and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000} 
```

I'm going to offer $940,000.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous one.  I'm hoping this is a sweet spot where he feels like he's getting a good deal, but it's still close enough to my desired range to be worthwhile."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This negotiation has gone on long enough.  While $915,000 isn't terrible, it's still below my minimum.  I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer and will pay my desired price. It's time to move on and secure the deal with John."
