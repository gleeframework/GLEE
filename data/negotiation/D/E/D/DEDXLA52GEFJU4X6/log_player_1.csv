Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer.  Bob is clearly interested and negotiating. Let's counter in the next round."

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think $1,150,000 is still the sweet spot. How about we meet at $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

**Reasoning:** While we could push for more, Bob is consistently moving upward and we're getting into a good range. Accepting at $1,175,000 secures a significant profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
