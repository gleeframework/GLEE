"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a decent price, it's still above my maximum value of $120.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see you're interested in the product, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $108, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $108, which is within my budget of $120 and a better price than John's offer of $120. It's a fair compromise, and I'm happy to accept it."
