Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, but unfortunately, $12,000 is a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're open to discussing that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
