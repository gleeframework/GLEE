"Bob, I understand your position. While I value your interest, $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it still offers you a good deal considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To show my commitment to a deal, I'm willing to go down to $890,000. This is a small step closer to your offer, and I hope it makes sense given the value this product holds for you. Let's try to bridge the gap.",890000.0,Alice,5,
