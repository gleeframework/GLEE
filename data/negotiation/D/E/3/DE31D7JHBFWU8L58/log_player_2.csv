# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time opportunity to acquire a truly unique item that will bring you great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You can get the same product from John for a lower price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice to save money."
