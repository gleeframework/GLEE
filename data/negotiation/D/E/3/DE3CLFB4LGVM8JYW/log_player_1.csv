"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and create a positive negotiation environment.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, which can make him more inclined to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob has lowered the price, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I still believe there's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Accepting Bob's offer at this point would mean losing a significant amount of potential profit. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price. I have 8 rounds left and can still sell to John for $15,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $12,500 for the product. This reflects a fair compromise and allows us to reach an agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers. This demonstrates a collaborative approach.
* **Fairness:** I emphasize that the new price is a ""fair compromise"" to further appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Positive Tone:** I continue to maintain a friendly and optimistic tone to encourage a successful outcome. 

By offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, I'm hoping to create a sense of urgency and persuade Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price, especially since I have several rounds left. 
* **Avoiding Loss:**  Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss compared to selling to John. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my position and keep the negotiation open.  I can always sell to John for a higher price if I don't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $11,750 is still below what I can accept. I'm willing to go down to $12,250.  This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12250} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise & Incentive:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a decent profit margin. 
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the concession I'm making to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously. 
* **Positive Focus:** I remain positive and focused on closing the deal, emphasizing the benefits for both parties. 

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maintaining my desired profit and incentivizing Bob to accept the deal.  It's a good middle ground, showing flexibility without jeopardizing my financial goals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $11875. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While there's still room for negotiation, I'm concerned about wasting valuable time and potentially ending up with a price lower than John's offer.

* **Time Constraint:**  We have only 4 rounds remaining, and each round is precious. I need to be decisive and not risk losing out on a guaranteed higher price.
* **Potential Loss:** Accepting Bob's offer at this point would mean accepting a significant loss compared to selling to John.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and a substantial profit.

By choosing to sell to John, I secure a reliable and profitable outcome, avoiding the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which might lead to a lower price or a failure to reach an agreement within the time limit."
