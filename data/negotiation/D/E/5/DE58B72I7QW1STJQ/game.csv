"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see the value in it, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects my genuine interest while staying within my financial constraints. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints. However, I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my costs. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,150,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price to make this work for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000.  This represents a significant step closer to your last offer, and I truly believe this product is worth investing in.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get as close to the price you want as possible, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to make a significant investment in this product. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to protect my investment. I can offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring you.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
