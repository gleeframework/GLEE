"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $11,500 for it.  It's a great deal considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $10,500 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's still a great price for the value you'll get.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,750? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you on the budget. $10,750 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Let's try $10,900. This gives us both a little room to breathe and keeps things moving towards a deal. What do you say?",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,800? I'm really close to making a decision, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. Let's see if we can find a way to make it work.",10800.0,Bob,6,
