"Alice, $18,000 is way out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $12,000. Would you be willing to negotiate down to that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $18,000 is a fair starting point considering the value this product brings.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $15,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $13,000. It's a good compromise, and it's the highest I can go.",13000.0,Bob,4,
