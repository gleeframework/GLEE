"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an item that holds significant value for me at this price point, while also providing you with substantial benefits given its worth to you. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, I'm not quite ready to commit to $12,000.  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider a middle ground. In light of that, I propose a revised price of $11,500 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between my valuation and your budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $11,500 is still lower than buying from John for $15,000.
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further. Accepting at this point secures a good deal and avoids the risk of a breakdown in negotiations."
