Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special price of $119. I think it would be perfect for you, and at this price, it's a steal! What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible, while staying above our minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still guaranteeing a profit if he accepts.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and the ""deal"" Bob is getting, increasing the chances of acceptance. 

**Why not other prices?**

* **$120 or higher:** Bob is unlikely to accept, knowing he can get it for less elsewhere. 
* **$100:** This is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, but we can get more from John.
* **Significantly lower than $119:**  This leaves too much potential profit on the table."
