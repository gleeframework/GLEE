"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1200000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. This represents a significant discount and allows you to acquire a valuable asset for a price below its true market value. Consider this a unique opportunity. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
