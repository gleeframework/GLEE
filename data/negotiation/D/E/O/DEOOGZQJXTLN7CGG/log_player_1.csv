Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a price above my minimum of $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a higher price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}

I'm counteroffering at $90. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer and closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a higher price, $87.5 is a good compromise and significantly better than selling to John."
