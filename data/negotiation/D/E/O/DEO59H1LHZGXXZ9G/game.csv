"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $9,000.  How about we split the difference at $9,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, but no more. Can we meet at $9,200?",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $9,200 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $9,400?  It's only a small difference, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",9400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm really struggling to go above $9,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,200 and $9,400, which would be $9,300. Can we do that?",9300.0,Bob,6,
