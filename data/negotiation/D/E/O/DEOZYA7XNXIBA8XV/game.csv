"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a significant discount given its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $1,050,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire the product while still ensuring I receive a fair price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
