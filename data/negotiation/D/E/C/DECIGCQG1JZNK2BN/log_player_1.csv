Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the potential benefits and allows us both to make a reasonable deal.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,350,000 is still above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing in smaller increments and are still significantly below John's guaranteed offer. It's unlikely further negotiation with Bob will bridge the gap to a price that surpasses selling to John."
