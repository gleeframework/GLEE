"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's close to Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, highlighting his perceived value to encourage acceptance.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This price allows for some back and forth without immediately hitting my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe we can reach a better agreement. I am willing to pay $13500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit.
* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  While $13,500 is a good starting point, I'm hoping we can reach a price closer to $14,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,750?  It's still a good deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  I'm aiming for a compromise by increasing Bob's offer slightly. 
* **Maintaining Profit:** This price is still above my minimum threshold of $10,000 and closer to my ideal selling point.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm again emphasizing the value proposition for Bob to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better. I would like to propose $13600 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's offer is very close to my previous counteroffer. There's not much more room for negotiation.
* **Profit Margins:** While $13,600 is not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum threshold and a reasonable profit for the product.
* **Avoiding Risk:** Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob as a buyer and potentially having to sell to John for a lower price. 

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to secure a sale and avoid potential losses from further negotiations."
