{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it!  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value of $100. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room:** The price is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging message to make Bob feel comfortable negotiating. 
* **Next Steps:** I'm prepared to counteroffer if Bob rejects this initial offer, keeping in mind my minimum price and John's potential offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Counter-Offer Potential:** I have room to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $150 is a safety net, but I'm not in a rush to sell to him yet. I'll try to get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. How about $140? It's still a great deal for a product like this, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer ($175) and Bob's offer ($120). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $140 is above my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Positive & Motivating:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone and highlighting the value of the product to keep Bob engaged.
* **Negotiation:** I'm demonstrating my flexibility in the negotiation while still aiming for a price closer to my goal. 

**Next Steps:** I'm prepared to counteroffer again if needed, but I'm hopeful that Bob will accept this offer, as it's still a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $130? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay under $130. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation Limits:**  I'm running the risk of spending too much time negotiating and potentially getting stuck with a price that's not ideal. 
* **John's Offer:**  John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price. By selling to John, I ensure a quick and profitable sale without further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**  I'm choosing the secure option of selling to John to avoid potentially lower prices and wasted time in further negotiation."
