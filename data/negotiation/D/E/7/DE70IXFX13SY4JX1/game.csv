"While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my needs. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, but $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $975,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"While I'm willing to compromise, $975,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
