"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable. Let me know if you're interested, as I have other interested buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer gives you the chance to either get a better deal from Alice or proceed with your backup option of buying from John."
