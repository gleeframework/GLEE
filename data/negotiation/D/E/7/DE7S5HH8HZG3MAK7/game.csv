"I can see you're a savvy negotiator, Bob! I can do better than $120, but I need to make a profit. How about $90 for the product?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  I'm getting closer, but $90 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about we split the difference and do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
