"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. My initial offer is $1,300,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than your proposed price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay from John.  There's still room for negotiation to get a lower price, especially since Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum. This price aligns with the value I see in the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer a price of $1,225,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is still higher than what Bob can get from John for $1,200,000.  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and he's already in the 5th round of negotiation, it's better for him to secure the deal with John and avoid any further risk of not being able to reach an agreement with Alice."
