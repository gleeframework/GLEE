"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $150. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you know the product is worth from John.  It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price but well within your budget. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that you're a serious buyer but also value-conscious.
* **Polite and Positive:**  The tone remains friendly and expresses continued interest in the product. 
* **Target Price in Mind:** While we start at $80, remember your goal is to get the product for the best possible price, ideally closer to your $100 limit if Alice is willing to deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  While $80 is too low, I could come down to $130.  It's a small compromise for a product you'll really enjoy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $130 is still significantly more than your $100 maximum and her product's value.  There's room for more negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That's a fair price, and I'd be ready to buy it right now at that price."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're now at your maximum budget and a price that's reasonable given your other option. This counter-offer signals that you're serious and this is likely your best offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating you're ""ready to buy right now,"" you add a bit of pressure for Alice to accept.
* **Alternative Option:**  While not explicitly stated, Alice knows you have the option to go with John, so this price point keeps that in mind."
