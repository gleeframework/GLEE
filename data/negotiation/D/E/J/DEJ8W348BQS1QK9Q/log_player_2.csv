"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially since you have 10 rounds to go.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also sets a clear expectation that I'm not willing to pay the full price. I'm aiming to get close to my target price of $1,000,000, but I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, her offer is still above my desired price.  I want to try to get closer to $1,000,000.  By rejecting, I can counteroffer again and hopefully get her closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product. However, I'm still keeping it below my $1,000,000 limit and leaving some room for negotiation. This is a good compromise point, aiming to close the gap between our positions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still within my budget and have several rounds left.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my $1,000,000 target with a few more counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time just slightly. I'm demonstrating to Alice that I'm willing to negotiate and that I'm serious about buying the product. I'm hoping this small increase will convince Alice to accept, but if not, I'm still within my budget and have several rounds left to continue negotiating."
