,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $175.  This is still a great price for this product, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.  Let's make this happen!",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $175 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this happen.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're trying to get a good price, and I appreciate that.  However, $100 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $160, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen! ",160.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $120 is still below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal!",140.0,Alice,7,
