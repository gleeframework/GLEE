# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000.  I know it's valuable to you and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can save $2,000 by buying from John. You're willing to walk away if the price isn't right, and right now, John offers a better deal."
