Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000.  I know it's valuable to you and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible (the price John will pay).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price higher than $12,000 but lower than $15,000.
* **Appear Reasonable:**  Starting too high (close to $15,000) might discourage Bob immediately. This offer balances our goal with a price likely to keep Bob engaged."
