Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. I think this is a fair price considering the value it offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $130, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80 but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I don't undervalue the product.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm being friendly and open to negotiation by asking Bob for his thoughts. This helps build rapport and encourages him to engage.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  By offering a price lower than my minimum, I anticipate Bob will likely make a counteroffer. This allows for a more dynamic negotiation process. 
* **The backup plan:**  I'm aware of John's offer, which provides me with a safety net. If the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out, I can easily sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would mean a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is low, he has shown interest in the product and is willing to negotiate. This suggests there is room for a counteroffer that might be more beneficial.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage in the negotiation. This shows that I'm not desperate to sell and am willing to stand my ground.

I will now proceed to make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $90 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price that is halfway between my previous offer of $130 and Bob's offer of $90. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm reminding Bob that even at $110, he's getting a good deal, implying that he should consider the value of the product.
* **Reframing the offer:** I'm reframing the offer as a ""good deal"" for Bob, focusing on the positive aspects of accepting.
* **Keeping the option of selling to John open:** $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, so I'm not risking a loss if Bob rejects this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to accept such a large loss.
* **Negotiation stalemate:**  Bob's counteroffer suggests he's unlikely to budge further. Continuing to negotiate would likely lead to a lengthy process with no guarantee of a satisfactory outcome.
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $150, which is significantly more profitable than accepting Bob's offer.

Selling to John ensures I get the best possible price and minimizes the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
