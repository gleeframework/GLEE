I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value but still above my minimum. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation."

Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
