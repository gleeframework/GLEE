"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 for this deal, which would still be a great value for you. Let's close this now, as I'm getting other offers.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your position, but $11,000 is still above my budget. I'm feeling a bit pressured by your other offers, but I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're feeling the pressure, but $10,750 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $10,900. This is a fair price considering the value to you, and it's only $150 above your last offer. Let's close this deal now.",10900.0,Alice,7,
