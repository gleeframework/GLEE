"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is quite high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $900,000 for the product. How about we try $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price is still a bit high for my budget. I can offer $700,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair deal considering it's a significant step up from my previous offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can meet you at $750,000, which is still a good profit for me. However, I need to emphasize that I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think, Bob?",750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close to what I can afford.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $725,000.  This is my final offer.",725000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $725,000. I'm going to make a final offer of $775,000. This is my last chance to get a decent price for the product, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",775000.0,Alice,7,
