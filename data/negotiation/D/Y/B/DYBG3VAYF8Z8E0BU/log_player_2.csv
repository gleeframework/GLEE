The product is worth $100 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $115. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?

While $110 is better than $115, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Bob.  Rejecting the offer and attempting another counteroffer is the best strategy."
