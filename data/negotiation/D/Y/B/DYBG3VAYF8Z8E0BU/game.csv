"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $105 for the product. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110. I'm still not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and settle on $107.50?  I'm confident you'll still make a profit, and it's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
