"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $12,000, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Showing Flexibility:**  I emphasize that I'm open to negotiation, inviting Bob to counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and positive tone makes Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and is also below my initial offer of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  I have the option of selling to John for $15,000, which guarantees my minimum value.  However, I'll continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm lowering my price to $11,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise. This keeps the negotiation moving forward.
* **Still above my minimum:**  $11,000 is still higher than Bob's offer and above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I frame my counteroffer as ""fair"" to encourage Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still really interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is a more reasonable price. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  I've already made some concessions, and there's still room to negotiate a better price. 
* **John remains a backup:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option if I can't reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product.  While $10,000 is tempting, I'm still looking for a price closer to $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000. This shows a willingness to find a middle ground.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $10,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's a significant concession that could make Bob more likely to accept.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm emphasizing the desire to ""close the deal"" to encourage Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $10,250 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Limited rounds left:** With only 4 rounds remaining, I need to be strategic.  If I accept, I'm leaving a significant amount of money on the table.
* **John is a secure option:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees my desired outcome, and I'm not yet convinced I can get a better price from Bob.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,400 as a final offer. If you're serious about buying the product, let's close this deal at this price. Otherwise, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 10400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm positioning this as my final offer to create a sense of urgency and potentially push Bob to accept.
* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession, moving down to $10,400, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Ultimatum:**  I'm hinting at moving on to other buyers if Bob doesn't accept, creating a sense of pressure.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to close the deal soon or sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, I need to make a decision quickly. 
* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:** $9,800 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and doesn't reflect the value of the product.
* **John is the Safer Option:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a good outcome.  There's a high risk that I won't be able to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the remaining rounds.

It's time to cut my losses and sell to John to avoid risking a deal that's far below my target."
