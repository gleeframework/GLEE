Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit from Bob, who values the product significantly more than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While starting high, the offer leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price that's still very profitable for you (and acceptable to him).
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 with John, giving you leverage. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob.

This strategy balances ambition with a realistic understanding of the situation and your backup plan."
