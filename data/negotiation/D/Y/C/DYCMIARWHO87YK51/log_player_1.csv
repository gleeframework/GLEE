Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $13,750.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13750}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $13,200 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's try to reach a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the value you place on it. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to hold out for more, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  I'm confident that Bob is likely to walk away if I reject this offer.  Selling to John for $12,000 would be less than ideal.  $13,000 is still a good deal for me, and it's better than losing the deal with Bob."
