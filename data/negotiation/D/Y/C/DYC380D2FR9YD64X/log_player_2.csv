"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. I have room to negotiate further and try to secure a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a profit while also meeting your needs.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. While it's closer to my target price, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,350,000. I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1,325,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,325,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. While we've come close to a deal, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the opportunity to purchase the product from John at my target price. It's better to secure the product at a known and affordable price from John than to continue negotiating with Alice and potentially end up with no product at all."
