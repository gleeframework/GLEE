"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiations at a price of $1,200,000. This is a great value considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still above your desired price point. You want to try and negotiate a lower price.  It's too early to buy from John, as you have 10 rounds to potentially get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're highlighting, I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from your initial offer and still allows for a profitable sale for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $1,075,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value you'll get from the product, while also being a good deal for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to your target price, but it's still slightly higher.  You have more rounds to negotiate, and there's room to push for a lower price. Buying from John would be a safe option, but you could potentially save $75,000 by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. Let's find a middle ground and get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're sticking to your offer of $950,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly coming down on her price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than what you're willing to pay. You're getting closer to your target price, but with more rounds left, it's worth continuing to negotiate.  You have a good chance of reaching a better price with a few more counteroffers, and it's still better than buying from John immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down further, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering your cost and the product's value to me. I'm confident we can close this deal at this price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're willing to go up to $1,000,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer you a price of $1,025,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly holding on to a price above your ideal target.  With only 3 rounds remaining, the chance of a better deal is diminishing. While $1,025,000 is a decent price, buying from John at $1,000,000 guarantees you a solid deal and saves you time and potential further negotiation. The risk of Alice not accepting a counteroffer in the next round outweighs the potential $25,000 saving."
