"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiations at a price of $1,200,000. This is a great value considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're highlighting, I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from your initial offer and still allows for a profitable sale for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $1,075,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value you'll get from the product, while also being a good deal for me. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. Let's find a middle ground and get this deal done.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're sticking to your offer of $950,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering your cost and the product's value to me. I'm confident we can close this deal at this price. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're willing to go up to $1,000,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer you a price of $1,025,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
