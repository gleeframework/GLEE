Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it allows for negotiation and potentially secures a higher sale price than John's offer of $800,000. It also gives me room to lower the price if Bob makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
$950,000 is closer to my minimum value of $800,000, but I want to try and get a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $975,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aims for a price closer to my initial offer. It leaves room for a small concession if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $925,000 is a reasonable price, I'm not yet willing to accept it. I believe I can still get closer to my initial offer of $1,000,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise that meets Bob's last offer, but I'm hoping it will be enough to close the deal. I'm running the risk of Bob rejecting this offer, so if he does, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. Bob's last offer of $900,000 is still lower than my initial desired price, and I'm not confident I can get him to go higher. It's better to guarantee the sale at a decent price rather than risk losing both Bob and John."
