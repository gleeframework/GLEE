"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000. I know it's a significant investment, but I believe it will more than pay for itself in the long run.  If you're interested, let's schedule a call to discuss it further. If not, I understand and will be offering it to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000.
