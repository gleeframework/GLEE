"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  However, I'm not quite ready to go down to $8000 just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9000.  I'm still looking to save a bit more. Would you consider $8500?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to save money, but I'm still not quite comfortable with $8500.  How about we split the difference and go with $8750? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm sure you'd be happy with the value you'd be getting.",8750.0,Alice,5,
