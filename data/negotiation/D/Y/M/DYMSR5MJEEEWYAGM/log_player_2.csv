"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $10,000 to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you valuing the product so highly.  However, my budget for this is a bit lower.  Would you consider $8,500?  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to see if we can close this deal. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  At this point, Bob is better off buying from John for a guaranteed lower price.  Further negotiation with Alice carries the risk of not reaching an agreement and potentially losing out on the opportunity to buy from John."
