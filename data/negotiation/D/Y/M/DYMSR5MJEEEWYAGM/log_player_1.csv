Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $10,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still lower than my minimum ($10,000). This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's worth to me, subtly suggesting its value might be even higher.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** I expect Bob to counteroffer, so I'm not starting too aggressively. This allows for a more natural negotiation process.
* **Flexibility:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I can still negotiate further or choose to sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you valuing the product so highly.  However, my budget for this is a bit lower.  Would you consider $8,500?  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000). 
* **Negotiation:**  It's still worthwhile to try and negotiate further with Bob. There's potential to secure a better price than his initial offer. 
* **Alternative:**  While selling to John for $10,000 is a guaranteed option, I want to explore whether I can reach a more favorable outcome with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to see if we can close this deal. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but not too drastically. This shows good faith and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to keep it top of mind for Bob.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm prompting Bob to respond, encouraging him to counter or agree. 
* **Goal:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to my desired minimum while still leaving room for negotiation."
