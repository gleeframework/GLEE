"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $15000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you the product for $13000. It's a fair price considering its value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this unique product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $13000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000. Can you consider that price?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11000 is a significant concession, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I can offer you a compromise at $12500. It's a fair price that's closer to my original offer, but still a bit more negotiable. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12500.0,Alice,5,

I'm not willing to go up to $12500. I was thinking more along the lines of $10500. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?,10500.0,Bob,6,
