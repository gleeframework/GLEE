"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and even your minimum ($1,500,000) provides room for negotiation. 
* **Anchoring:** This initial high price sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if he counteroffers much lower, the negotiation will likely revolve around a higher number than if you started closer to his valuation.
* **Leaving John as a Backup:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's potential to get a better deal from Bob. We'll use John's offer as leverage later if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for reaching out, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above his perceived value of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We have room to negotiate and try to bring him closer to our desired range. John's offer provides a safety net, but we're not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it falls significantly short of what I believe the product is worth.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a number that reflects the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000?"",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Move, but Still Above Minimum:** We're dropping our price by $450,000, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, we remain firmly above our $1,500,000 minimum and above John's offer.
* **Justifying the Price:** We're not just throwing out numbers; we're emphasizing the ""true value"" of the product. This subtly reminds Bob of its worth and reinforces the idea that our price is justified.
* **Aiming for a Middle Ground:** The ""meet in the middle"" approach can be psychologically appealing. While not a true middle ground, it suggests compromise and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a significant counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my previous offer. Based on my budget and the current market conditions, I would like to propose an offer of $1,600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above our guaranteed sale price with John ($1,500,000). While we could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might:

* **Walk away:**  He's already significantly increased his offer, and there's no guarantee he'll go much higher. 
* **The negotiation could stall:**  We're getting close to the later rounds, and time is a factor. 

Accepting this offer secures a good profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of losing this deal entirely."
