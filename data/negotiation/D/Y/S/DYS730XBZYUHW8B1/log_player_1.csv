"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less to me than that. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $1,100,000 is a good amount, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price range. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to move closer to $1,200,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial offer.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $1,150,000.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll offer $1,050,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is better than John's offer, I still believe I can get closer to my target price of $1,200,000. I'm not ready to sell for that amount yet.  I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see that we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer is still well above what I could get elsewhere, and it's closer to your last offer. Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still not comfortable with the gap between our offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your latest offer, so I'll offer $1,050,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm feeling the pressure to close the deal,  $1,050,000 is still not quite where I want to be. I'm confident I can squeeze out a little more, especially with only 4 rounds left. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. Let's be realistic - I'm not going to go much lower than this.  I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000.  This offer is fair to both of us, and it lets us avoid the risk of this deal falling through.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your latest offer, so I'll offer $1,025,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to sell to John for $800,000.  We are down to the final two rounds, and I've exhausted all my options with Bob.  Although $800,000 is significantly less than what Bob is willing to pay, I'm running out of time.  It's better to secure a sale at $800,000 than risk losing everything by pushing Bob too far."
