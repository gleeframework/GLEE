"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to spend up to $15000 at most. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $15000?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I believe the product is worth more, I'm willing to come down a bit to $16000. This still leaves some room for profit for me, and I hope it's a price you can work with.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility. Given my budget constraints, could we discuss a price closer to $15000? Perhaps $15500 would be a fair compromise for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,
