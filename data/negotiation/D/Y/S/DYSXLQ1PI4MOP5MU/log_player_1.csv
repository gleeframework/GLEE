Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum Value:** I know the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, so I want to get more than that.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  By offering $12,000, I am taking a calculated risk. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $10,000, ensuring I don't lose money. But if Bob accepts, I make an extra $2,000.
* **Unknown Value to Bob:**  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm going with a price that is a decent margin above my minimum but not too high that it makes the offer unreasonable. 

This approach allows me to potentially maximize my earnings while still having a safety net."
