Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my counteroffer?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $925,000 is a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely. It's also closer to my minimum acceptable price than selling to John."
