"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I feel is fair. However, I'm willing to come down a bit more. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This reflects the substantial value the product brings and allows us to find common ground. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
