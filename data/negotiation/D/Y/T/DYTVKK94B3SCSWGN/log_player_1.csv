Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000 but still leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, emphasizing the value of the product for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

By starting with a slightly lower price, I hope to encourage Bob to engage in negotiation. This gives me the opportunity to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I can always walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  It's also far from the $12,000 I offered initially.  I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob or sell to John for a significantly better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, though.  How about $10,500? That gives you a good deal while still allowing me to make a decent profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $10,500 is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility while still keeping the price above my minimum value.
* **Message:** I reiterate my appreciation for Bob's interest and highlight the compromise I'm making, emphasizing the ""good deal"" he'd be getting. This is meant to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 

**Strategy:**

By moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm increasing the chances of a successful negotiation. However, the price is still above my minimum, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary. If Bob still refuses, I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price or sell to John for significantly more. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,000? This would give you a fantastic price and allow me to close this deal. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $10,000, which is a small increase from Bob's last offer but still significantly lower than my initial price. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the ""fantastic price"" Bob would be getting, adding a sense of urgency with ""Let's see if we can make this work!"" This is meant to encourage Bob to accept the offer and close the deal. 

**Strategy:**

This is my final counteroffer. If Bob rejects it, I'll move on and sell to John for $15,000. I'm confident that $10,000 is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping to reach an agreement with Bob."
