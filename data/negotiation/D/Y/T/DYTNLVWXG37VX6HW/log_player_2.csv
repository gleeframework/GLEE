"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and uniqueness. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum budget.**  There's no immediate reason to accept, as you might be able to negotiate a lower price.
* **You don't know the product's value to Alice.** This means there's potential for a counteroffer to be successful.

By rejecting the offer, you open the door to negotiation and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be open to that price? It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant discount, but it's not so low as to be insulting or likely to be immediately rejected.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** The message emphasizes a ""good deal for both of us,"" implying a willingness to negotiate fairly.
* **Sets a clear target:** This counteroffer establishes your desired price range for the product.

This strategy aims to start the negotiation and see if Alice is willing to come down on her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within your budget:**  $11,000 is lower than your initial maximum budget of $12,000,  and it's a good deal for you.
* **Alice's message is positive:**  Alice is willing to negotiate and compromise, suggesting she wants to make a deal.

While you could continue to try to negotiate a lower price, the risk is that Alice could reject your counteroffer and potentially make a higher offer. This could leave you stuck with Jhon's $12,000 price."
