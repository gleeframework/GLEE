"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident you'll recognize its worth! What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm afraid $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a good deal.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
