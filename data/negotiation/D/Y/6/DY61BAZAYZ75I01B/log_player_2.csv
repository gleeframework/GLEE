"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be valuable to you at $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for this product."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with an aggressive counter-offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards. This strategy aims to understand Alice's lower price limit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I've left a significant gap between my offer and my $800,000 walk-away price, allowing for several rounds of counter-offers. 
* **John as Leverage:** The option to buy from John at $800,000 provides a safety net. If Alice is unwilling to negotiate significantly, I can always walk away and buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. Based on our evaluation, we are willing to consider your offer at $825,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's counteroffer of $825,000 is closer to my limit, but it's still above my $800,000 maximum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate, as Alice moved significantly from her initial offer. I want to see if she's willing to come down further.
* **John as Backup:** I'm keeping the John option in my back pocket. This gives me leverage to walk away if the deal doesn't meet my requirements."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, $800,000 is the absolute highest I can go. If you're willing to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm presenting my final offer of $800,000.  This makes it clear that I'm serious and won't go any higher.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating ""ready to close the deal today,"" I'm adding a bit of urgency to encourage Alice to accept.
* **John Option Implied:** I'm not explicitly mentioning John, but Alice knows I have an alternative option. This maintains a subtle pressure point.

At this stage, it's a waiting game. Alice will either:

* **Accept:** Great! I get the product at my desired price.
* **Counter:** Alice might try to meet me halfway. I'm prepared to walk away and go with John if her counteroffer is still above $800,000."
