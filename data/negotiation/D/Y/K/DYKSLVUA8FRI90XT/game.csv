"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $125 to make this work.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,

This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a great opportunity for you to get this valuable product. Let me know if you're interested!",115.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $115 is getting closer, I'm still a bit hesitant.  I'm willing to go up to $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make this deal!",100.0,Bob,6,
