"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1300000 for the product. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to accept the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product's value is slightly higher. I'm proposing a new price of $1280000. This is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us. What do you think?",1280000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I think the product's value is still slightly higher than your latest offer. I'm proposing a new price of $1240000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you think?",1240000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product, which is the same price I offered earlier. I think this is a fair price, and I hope we can agree on it.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
