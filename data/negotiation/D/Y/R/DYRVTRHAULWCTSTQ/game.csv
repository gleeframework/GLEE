"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to move from my initial offer. How about we consider $1,125,000? This feels like a reasonable compromise that recognizes the product's true value.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,125,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $1,062,500. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1062500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I need to stay above $1,100,000. Would you consider $1,110,000? This is my final offer, as I do have another interested buyer.",1110000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you have another interested buyer, but I'm afraid I've already gone as high as I'm willing to go. I'd like to reiterate my previous offer of $1,062,500. If that's not acceptable, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options, including purchasing the product from John for $1,000,000.",1062500.0,Bob,6,
