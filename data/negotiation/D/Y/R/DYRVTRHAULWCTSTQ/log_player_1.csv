# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?

Bob's offer:

If that's not acceptable, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options, including purchasing the product from John for $1,000,000.

Bob is not budging from his offer, and it's clear he won't go above his maximum. Holding out for a slightly higher offer from Bob isn't worth the risk of losing the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
