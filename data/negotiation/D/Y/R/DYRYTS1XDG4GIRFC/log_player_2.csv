"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500.  I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,500 is better than $15,000, there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a lower counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is great, but I'm only willing to pay $13,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for us both to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to my own valuation of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now better than John's:**  $13,500 is less than the $15,000 John is asking.
* **Further negotiation might be time-consuming:** It's possible to try for a lower price, but there's no guarantee Alice will budge further, and this might take several more rounds of negotiation. 
* **The offer is close to Bob's desired price:** While Bob ideally wants to pay less, $13,500 is still a good deal for him, considering his upper limit of $15,000.

Accepting the offer saves time and secures a price within Bob's budget."
