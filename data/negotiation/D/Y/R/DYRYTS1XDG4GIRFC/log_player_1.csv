{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500.  I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer gives me a good profit, but also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants a lower price. I'm confident that he'll find the value proposition appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is great, but I'm only willing to pay $13,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for us both to be happy with the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to my own valuation of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
