Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000, but lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. 

Here's why:

* **Potential Profit:** I'm still making a decent profit of $2,000, which is better than nothing if Bob rejects the offer.
* **Negotiation Room:**  This price gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to accept. If he rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer.
* **Maximize the Potential Outcome:**  There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay closer to my minimum price, especially if he really wants the product.

By offering a price in the middle, I'm balancing my desire for profit with the need to make the deal appealing to Bob."
