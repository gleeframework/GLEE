Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,800 and $8,200. How about $7,950? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,950.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's clear he's very focused on staying below $8,000.  At this point, the risk of him not increasing his offer further outweighs the potential gain of a slightly higher price. Selling to John guarantees you your minimum acceptable price."
