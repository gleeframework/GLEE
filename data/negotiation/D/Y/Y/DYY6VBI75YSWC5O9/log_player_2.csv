"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $11,000 is better than John's price of $10,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  There's room for a lower price, and Bob wants to see if he can get closer to his $10,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $10,500? It's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $10,800, which is still a fair price for both of us. It's a great product, and I believe it's worth it. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,800 is very close to Bob's target price of $10,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will reject a lower counteroffer and then may not be willing to go lower.  At that point, Bob would be forced to buy from John at $10,000.  It's better to accept Alice's offer and save the potential hassle and uncertainty."
