Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $11,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation process, which can ultimately lead to a higher price than if I were to immediately accept a lower counteroffer. 
* **Staying above my minimum:** I'm not willing to sell below $12,000, so I'm ensuring that my offer is still profitable for me.
* **Positive and friendly tone:**  A friendly approach helps build rapport and might make Bob more willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $10,500? It's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $10,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting would mean taking a loss.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I can still negotiate with Bob and try to get closer to my desired price. 
* **John is a backup:** Knowing that I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $10,800, which is still a fair price for both of us. It's a great product, and I believe it's worth it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by lowering my price to $10,800. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $10,800 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, ensuring I won't lose money.
* **Highlighting the product's value:**  Reminding Bob about the product's value might convince him to pay a bit more.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  A friendly approach helps keep the negotiation positive and might make Bob more likely to accept."
