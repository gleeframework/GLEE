**Reasoning:**

While we'd ideally like to get the product for our last offer of $1,200,000, Alice is unlikely to go that low.  She's already come down significantly. Accepting at $1,215,000 secures a reasonable deal and avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down.  It's better to accept a slightly lower savings than risk having to buy from John for $1,500,000."
