Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell it to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to your business.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,750 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell it to you for $9,200. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I need to make a bit more profit. I can sell it to you for $9,250. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $9,200. While you *might* be able to negotiate her down a bit more, it's not worth the risk of her getting closer to her asking price. You can get the product for a guaranteed $10,000 from John, which is a better outcome than risking a higher final price with Alice."
