"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to consider a purchase, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I'm motivated to sell, I must be realistic about the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $2,025,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget concerns.",2025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'd be willing to go up to $1,800,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,700,000. Can you consider that?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best possible price, and I respect that.  However, $1,700,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I can do $1,950,000, and I believe that's a very fair offer. It represents significant movement on my part while still reflecting the true value of this product.  Let me know your thoughts.",1950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit away from my target. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $1,700,000 and $1,950,000, which would be $1,825,000. Can you consider that?",1825000.0,Bob,6,
