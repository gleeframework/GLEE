Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, Alice wants to get as close to that amount from Bob as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $950,000 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price higher than John's offer.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value, subtly justifying the high price. 

By setting the price high but leaving room for negotiation, Alice increases her chances of securing the best possible deal."
