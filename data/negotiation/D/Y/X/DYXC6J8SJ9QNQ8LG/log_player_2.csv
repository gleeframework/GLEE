"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject the offer. You can get the product for a lower price, and it's worth saving that extra money. You can counteroffer Alice to see if she'll come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a little less.  Would you be willing to do $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a little less, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to your desired price, you can likely still negotiate a better price.  You're only willing to pay $120 max, so keep pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little higher than I'd like to pay.  Let's try $95 and see if we can agree."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $95, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $95. How about $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, you should accept Alice's offer. You've managed to bring the price down to $100, which is a good deal for you.  You're willing to pay up to $120, so getting it for $100 is saving you $20. Any further negotiation is unlikely to get you a significantly lower price."
