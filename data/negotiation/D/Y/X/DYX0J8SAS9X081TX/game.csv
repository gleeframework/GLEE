"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is still a considerable amount.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this price.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $800000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $950000. This reflects the value I place on the product and still allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Please consider this counteroffer carefully.",950000.0,Alice,3,
