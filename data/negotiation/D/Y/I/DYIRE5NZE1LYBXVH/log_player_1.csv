Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100. It also leaves room for negotiation. 

I'm hoping Bob will accept the offer, but if he rejects it, I'll be prepared to counter-offer depending on his offer. If negotiations drag on, I can always sell to John for $100 to ensure I don't lose out completely."
