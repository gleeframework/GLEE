"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested, $950,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This reflects the true value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to reach an agreement. What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,
