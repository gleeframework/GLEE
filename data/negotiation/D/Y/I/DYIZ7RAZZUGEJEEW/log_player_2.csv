"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your desired price range.** You're aiming for a price under $1,000,000 and $950,000 is still too high.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Alice is willing to negotiate, as she's offered a price above her minimum. 
* **Buying from John is your fallback option.**  If you can't get a better price from Alice, you can always purchase from John for $1,000,000.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for a counteroffer from Alice or allow you to make your own counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested, $950,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is below Alice's price but above her minimum.** This shows you're serious about buying but want a better deal.
* **A significant decrease shows a willingness to negotiate.**  A $100,000 drop demonstrates that you're trying to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **The counteroffer still leaves room for further negotiation.**  Alice might counter back, allowing for further back-and-forth until a satisfactory price is reached."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still above your target price.** While it's lower than her initial offer, $900,000 is still more than you're comfortable paying.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Alice has lowered her price, demonstrating her willingness to negotiate. This indicates there's still potential to get a better deal.
* **You can still get a better price from Alice.**  By rejecting her offer, you can counter with a price closer to your desired $850,000, or potentially even lower if you're feeling bold.
* **John remains a fallback option.** If negotiations with Alice stall, you can always purchase the product from John for $1,000,000.

Rejecting Alice's offer gives you the opportunity to continue negotiating and potentially secure the product at a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000.  This is a fair compromise and allows us both to reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to your target price.** It's a smaller decrease than your previous offer, showing that you're getting closer to a deal.
* **It's still below Alice's offer.** This keeps the negotiations moving and shows that you're serious about buying but not willing to overpay.
* **It's a reasonable compromise.** The offer is in the middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's counteroffer, showing that you're trying to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **It leaves room for Alice to accept.**  You've made a significant concession, but there's still room for Alice to counter if she wants to negotiate further.

This counteroffer balances a firm position with a desire to reach an agreement, increasing the chances of a successful deal."
