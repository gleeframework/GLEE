{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer because I know it's worth at least $120 to me. I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if I can't reach a deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $100 is a good price, I'm still hoping for a bit more. Let's split the difference - how about $110?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's make one final compromise. I'll come down to $112. This is a fair price for both of us.  If this doesn't work, I'm going to have to move on."", ""product_price"": 112}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  I've made several counteroffers and Bob has consistently refused to go above $108. It's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement, and I'm not willing to drop below my minimum price of $120.  It's time to move on and sell to John."
