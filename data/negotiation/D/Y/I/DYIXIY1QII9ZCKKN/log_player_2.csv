"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $119. I believe it's a great deal for you, as I know it's worth a good amount to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $119 is close to your maximum budget, you can try to get a better deal. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her product value of $100. If not, you can always fall back on buying from John for $120."
