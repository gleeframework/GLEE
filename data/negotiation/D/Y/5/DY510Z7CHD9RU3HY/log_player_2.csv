"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $95 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $95 is a bit too close to your maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for offering, Alice! $95 seems a bit high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

We're starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price to leave room for negotiation.  This strategy aims to achieve the lowest possible price while acknowledging Alice's potential profit margin."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the offer but $70 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but there's still room for negotiation. We'll counter with a price closer to her valuation while staying below our $100 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $70 might have been a bit low.  How about $78? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

We're inching closer to her likely minimum acceptable price while staying well within your budget. This tactic aims to secure a good deal without dragging negotiations for too long."
