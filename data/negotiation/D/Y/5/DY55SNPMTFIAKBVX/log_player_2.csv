"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob and Alice is offering it at the same price, there's no benefit to accepting her offer. Bob can get the same product for the same price from John.  Rejecting the offer keeps the option open to potentially negotiate with Alice or find another seller with a lower price."
