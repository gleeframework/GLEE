Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a significantly higher price than your minimum ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're more likely to land a final price above your minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone invites a discussion, suggesting you might be flexible, but only to a certain extent.

**Important Note:**  While John offers a safety net, aiming high with Bob could lead to a much larger profit."
