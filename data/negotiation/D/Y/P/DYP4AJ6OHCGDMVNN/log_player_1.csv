``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000, but leaves room for negotiation and still offers a significant profit for Alice. It's important to be friendly and open to negotiation to keep Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $1,100,000 for the product. I think it's a bit pricey, but I'm still interested in making a deal. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is a decent profit, it's still significantly less than Alice's minimum goal of $1,500,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Alice to try and get closer to her target price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value you'll gain from this product, I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,125,000. Can you consider this revised offer?
