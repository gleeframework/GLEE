"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $5,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  This price reflects the value you'll receive from the product, and it's still a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a little ways off at $9,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still trying to get a better price, but $7,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $8,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal!",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $7,500. Would you be open to that?",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $7,500 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let's make this happen!",8000.0,Alice,7,
