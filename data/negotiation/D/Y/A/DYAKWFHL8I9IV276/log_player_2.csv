Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $5,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  This price reflects the value you'll receive from the product, and it's still a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?

Round 5
