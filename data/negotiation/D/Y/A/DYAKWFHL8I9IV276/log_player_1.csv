"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it would be a valuable asset to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, knowing it's above Bob's value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:**  I'm being friendly and highlighting the value of the product for Bob.
* **Room for compromise:** This initial offer allows for several rounds of negotiation without hitting my minimum value too quickly. 
* **Prepared for John:**  I'm aware of the $15,000 offer from John, so I'm willing to walk away if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is way too low:**  $5,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $15,000, and even significantly lower than my initial offer. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** I have 8 rounds remaining, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better price.
* **Not ready to sell to John:**  While $15,000 is my minimum, I'd prefer to try and maximize my earnings with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $5,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  This price reflects the value you'll receive from the product, and it's still a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but stay firm:** I've dropped my price significantly from $12,000 to $9,000, showing flexibility. However, this is still well above Bob's initial offer and closer to my minimum value.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reiterating the product's worth to Bob and emphasizing that $9,000 is a fair price for both parties.
* **Keep the negotiation going:**  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a little ways off at $9,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** $7,000 is still below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Room for more negotiation:** I have 6 rounds remaining, and I'm confident I can push for a higher price. 
* **Not ready to sell to John:**  I'm still hoping to maximize my earnings with Bob, so selling to John isn't the best option yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're still trying to get a better price, but $7,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $8,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small compromise, big impact:** I'm lowering my price by only $500, showing I'm flexible but still holding firm on my minimum. 
* **Urgency and finality:**  I'm emphasizing the need for a quick agreement and suggesting this is my final offer.
* **Focus on the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and highlighting the benefits of closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $7,500. Would you be open to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $7,500 is still under my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Time is on my side:**  I still have 4 rounds left, and I've shown flexibility.  I can continue to push for a higher price.
* **Risk of selling to John:**  While I'm getting close to my minimum, I still believe I can secure a better deal with Bob.  Selling to John now would mean leaving money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $7,500 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Last compromise:** I'm making a final compromise by dropping my price to $8,000, which is just $500 above Bob's offer.
* **Emphasizing the fairness:** I'm highlighting the fact that $8,000 is a middle ground and a fair price for both of us.
* **Urgency and finality:** I'm using phrases like ""let's make this happen"" to create a sense of urgency and push Bob towards accepting. 
* **Still above minimum:** This offer is still above my minimum value of $15,000, so I'm not taking a huge loss.

With only three rounds remaining, I'm aiming to close the deal at a price that's acceptable to both of us."
