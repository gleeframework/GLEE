"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you and the price you're willing to sell it for.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the counteroffer.  While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking to get closer to your initial offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing a counteroffer of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
