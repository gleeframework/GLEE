Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right person. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming to earn more than $8,000, so this offer is a good starting point.
* **It's lower than Bob's maximum:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so he has room to negotiate and still come out ahead. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This offer allows for a back and forth, giving you the opportunity to potentially increase the price further.

Remember, you can always choose to go with John's offer of $8,000 if the negotiation with Bob stalls or you feel like you're not getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you and the price you're willing to sell it for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than $8,000, it's still significantly lower than the $12,000 you initially offered.  There's still room for negotiation, and you should aim for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and the counteroffer.  While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking to get closer to your initial offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing a counteroffer of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for you.  You're getting close to your desired price, and Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate. It's likely that if you reject this offer, he might back out completely or make a counteroffer that's closer to his initial $9,000 offer, making you lose more money.  Accepting this offer allows you to secure a good profit while still leaving some room for negotiating with other buyers in the future."
