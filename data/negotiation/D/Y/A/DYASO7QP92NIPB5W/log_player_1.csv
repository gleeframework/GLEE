"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm also being friendly and highlighting the value of the product, hoping to build rapport and encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $130 is a little lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $135.  That seems like a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering a price of $135, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm trying to be reasonable and create a sense of urgency, hoping to close the deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130 again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to make a bit more on this sale.  I'm willing to go down to $132.  It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 132}
```

I'm offering a price of $132, which is a small compromise but still closer to my minimum than Bob's last offer. I'm trying to be firm but still open to a deal. I'm also emphasizing the value proposition of the product, hoping to sway Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $132. Would you be willing to meet me at $129? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $129. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $129
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling to John.  Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and we are close to my minimum price.  Since I have a guaranteed sale with John for $150, it makes more sense to end the negotiation with Bob and accept John's offer.  While I'd love to get more, I want to ensure a sale and not risk losing a buyer entirely."
