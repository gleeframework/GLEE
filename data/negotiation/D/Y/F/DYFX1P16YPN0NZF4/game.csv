,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $10500 for the product. Is that something you'd be interested in?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your budget, Bob! I can see you're serious about the product. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for it. I can do $10750 for the product. Is that a deal-breaker or a deal-maker for you?",10750.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more adjustment, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can do $10000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're really interested in the product, this is my final offer",10000.0,Alice,7,
