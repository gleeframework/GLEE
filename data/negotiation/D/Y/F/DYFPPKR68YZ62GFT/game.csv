"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a fair price, and I get to move it quickly.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. It's a fair offer considering its value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $800,000 is simply too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price to make this worthwhile. How about $1,200,000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to recover a reasonable amount. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still quite a ways off from that price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  That's my final offer.  It's a win-win for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
