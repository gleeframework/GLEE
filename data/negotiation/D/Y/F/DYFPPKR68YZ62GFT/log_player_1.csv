{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a fair price, and I get to move it quickly.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. It's a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for such a significant loss. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $800,000 is simply too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price to make this worthwhile. How about $1,200,000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to recover a reasonable amount. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still quite a ways off from that price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  That's my final offer.  It's a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still significantly lower than my minimum. While $1,000,000 is a good deal for him, it's not worth it for me to continue negotiating.  I'll go with John's offer, which ensures a much better outcome."
