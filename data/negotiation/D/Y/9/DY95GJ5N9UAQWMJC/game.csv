"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the value you get.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'll consider your offer of $11,500. However, I still aim to stay within my budget. Could you possibly lower the price to $11,000? I believe this would be a mutually beneficial arrangement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
