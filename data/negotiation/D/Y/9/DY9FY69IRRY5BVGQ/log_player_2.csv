"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this product, which holds immense value, for $1500000. This price reflects the potential it possesses.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a high starting point, and you can likely get a better price. You have a strong fallback with John, so you're in a good position to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is higher than I'm comfortable paying at this point. Considering the product's potential, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  I'm confident this price reflects a fair value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This price still represents a significant opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has come down a bit, but her offer is still above your target. You're not in a rush, so you can continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Given my current budget and the product's market value, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price and represents a strong deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1200000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1250000. This price allows us both to achieve a successful outcome. Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is now closer to your price, but you're nearing your limit. You're only $50,000 away from John's price. There's a risk that if you continue negotiating, Alice will reject your next offer and you'll have to either accept her counteroffer, which could be higher than John's, or walk away with nothing. 

It's better to secure the product at John's price, especially since you've established a reliable alternative."
