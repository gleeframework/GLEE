"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I think it's a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet closer to the middle at $17,000? This product truly delivers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with it.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $17,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $15,500? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",15500.0,Bob,4,
