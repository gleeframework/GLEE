Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, I'm sure you'll agree! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80.  This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary.  I'm also trying to build excitement and create a sense of urgency with my message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $78 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that we won't be able to reach an agreement.  Since John is willing to pay $80, I'll sell the product to him to guarantee I get at least my minimum price."
