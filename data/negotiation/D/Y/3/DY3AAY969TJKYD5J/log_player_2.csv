"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at its true value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

You are willing to pay $120 maximum, and Alice is offering the product at $120. There's no room for negotiation to save money, so you might as well go with John who is already selling it for your maximum price."
