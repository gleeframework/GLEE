# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is still above your maximum value of $150. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $110,  that's still a good deal for you, considering the value it provides.  What do you say?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
