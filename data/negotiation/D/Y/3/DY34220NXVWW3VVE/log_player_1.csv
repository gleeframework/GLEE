{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a good starting point.  We'll see what Bob's response is and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is above my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $110,  that's still a good deal for you, considering the value it provides.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
