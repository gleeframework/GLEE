"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $8,000 to us, and we believe it's equally valuable to you. To start our negotiation, I propose a price of $7,200 for the product.",7200.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $7,200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $6,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider it. To move forward, I propose a price of $6,800 for the product. This is higher than your offer but still lower than our initial asking price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that suits both of us.",6800.0,Alice,3,
