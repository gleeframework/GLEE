"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $8,000 to us, and we believe it's equally valuable to you. To start our negotiation, I propose a price of $7,200 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $7,200 is lower than the product's worth to Bob, it's still a significant price. Bob should reject the offer and see if he can get a better price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $7,200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $6,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 6500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider it. To move forward, I propose a price of $6,800 for the product. This is higher than your offer but still lower than our initial asking price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that suits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price from $7,200 to $6,800, which is closer to Bob's desired price point.  Since Bob's goal is to save money, accepting this offer is the best option. It's a good deal, as Bob is getting the product for less than what it's worth to him while still saving $1,200.  There's no guarantee that Bob can get a lower price in the next round, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether."
