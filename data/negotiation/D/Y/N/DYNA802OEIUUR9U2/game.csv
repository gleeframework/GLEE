"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 feels fair. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it, based on my own valuation and the market. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a significant way off from where I see the value.  This product has the potential to be a real game-changer for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's potential. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $987,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",987500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  $987,500 is close, but I need to see a bit more movement to make this work for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? That's a significant compromise on my end.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
