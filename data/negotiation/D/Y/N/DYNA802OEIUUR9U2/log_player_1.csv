Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it, based on my own valuation and the market. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's potential. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $987,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.
