"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  $1,100,000 is simply too far below what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000.  This price still leaves you a good margin of profit, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit as well. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
