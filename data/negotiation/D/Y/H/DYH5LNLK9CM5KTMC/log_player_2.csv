Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to my maximum. It's a good starting point for negotiation, and if she rejects, I'll adjust accordingly."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than my initial counteroffer, but still not as good as John's price. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice to try and get a better deal before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate, but her offer is still too high. I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm serious about buying but still maintaining a lower price than her previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now higher than my initial budget.  It's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to a price I'm comfortable with.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $120, securing the product within my budget and avoiding further negotiation."
