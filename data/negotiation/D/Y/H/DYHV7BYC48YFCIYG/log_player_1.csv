Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a significant opportunity for you, and I'm pleased to offer it to you first.  Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium over his perceived value of $800,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 is a significant markup from Bob's valuation but still offers him a substantial discount compared to my guaranteed sale price.
* **First Refusal Incentive:** By emphasizing that Bob has the first opportunity, I create a sense of exclusivity and urgency.

**Outcome:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** I make a profit of $600,000 (significantly more than selling to John).
* **If Bob Rejects:** I sell to John for $1,500,000, ensuring I get my minimum desired price."
