"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's valued at over a million dollars to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm confident this is a unique opportunity for you, and I'd like to start with a price of $950000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm afraid $950000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $850000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1000000. I'm eager to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $850000 is unfortunately too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm confident this product will be incredibly valuable to you, and I'd be happy to lower my price to $900000. This allows for a significant gain for you and a fair return for me. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $875000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1000000, and I'm willing to make a significant purchase. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
