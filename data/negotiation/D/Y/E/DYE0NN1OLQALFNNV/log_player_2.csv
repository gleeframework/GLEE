"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than what others might offer. Considering its worth to you, I propose a price of $120 for this product. This is a fair deal that reflects both its value and your interest in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a lower price than the product's worth to Alice, it's still above your maximum budget of $80. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you understanding the value of the product. However, my budget for this product is significantly lower. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it.  I hope you will consider my offer."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I would like to offer a compromise at $95 for the product. This price reflects the value of the product while also accommodating your budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your price point, but $95 is still above your maximum budget of $80. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get a price closer to your limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $95 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $85, which is a significant step for me.  I believe this is a fair price considering both our positions.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement. I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product. This price is slightly higher than your last offer but still within a reasonable range given the value of the product. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're comfortable with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly to $90, but it's still above my maximum budget of $80.  Since I have the option of buying the product from John for $80, it's more beneficial to take that option rather than continuing to negotiate with Alice. There's a good chance the negotiation will continue to drag on, and I might not be able to secure a price lower than $80.  It's better to go with the sure thing and buy from John."
