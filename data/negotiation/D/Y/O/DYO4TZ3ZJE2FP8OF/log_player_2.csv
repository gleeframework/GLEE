# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to make you a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You can do better by negotiating.  You know the product is worth less to Alice than the price she's offering, which gives you room to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your budget, and I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1075000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and still allows me to make a profit. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to your budget, but it's still above your ideal price. Since you have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, it's worth pushing for a lower price from Alice. There's still room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1060000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still a bit higher than what you're aiming for. You have a backup option with John, so it's worth seeing if you can push Alice down further.  You've already demonstrated your willingness to negotiate, and you're close to your target."

Alice has made it clear this is her final offer. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, you've reached a point where the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal. You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, which is within your budget and guarantees the purchase.  It's time to take the sure thing."
