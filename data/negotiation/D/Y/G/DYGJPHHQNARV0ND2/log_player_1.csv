Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth while also offering you significant value."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your minimum:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, so you should never sell for less.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  You need to offer a price significantly lower than your minimum to make it attractive to him. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate. If he counters, you can potentially still settle on a price above your guaranteed $1,500,000. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly lower. 
* **Urgency:** If you need to sell the product quickly, a slightly lower offer might be more enticing.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while considering the dynamics of the negotiation."
