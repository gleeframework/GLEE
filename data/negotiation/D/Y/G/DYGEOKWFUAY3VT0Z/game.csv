"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's on the table.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which I think is a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
