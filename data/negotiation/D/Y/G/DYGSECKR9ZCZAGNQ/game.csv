"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $850,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I have a firm budget, and to be frank,  $825,000 is just too far off.  My final offer is $775,000.  I think this is a fair price, and if you can't accept, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",775000.0,Bob,6,
