Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've carefully considered your last offer. I'd like to propose $885,000 as a compromise. This price aligns better with my budget while still showing appreciation for the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000

The goal is to maximize profit. While we can try to push Bob a little further, the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price is too high. This offer is only $5,000 lower than our previous counteroffer, so it's a reasonable compromise."
