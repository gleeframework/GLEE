Round 2

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  $7,500 is below my minimum, and I believe I can get closer to my target."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $7,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I've had 4 rounds of negotiation and it doesn't seem like we're going to reach a mutually acceptable price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000."
