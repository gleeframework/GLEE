Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking $10,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000, making it attractive to Bob. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers. 
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a backup at $12,000 gives me leverage and a firm floor for negotiations. I won't settle for less than $12,000, as I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $12,000, and even below what I initially offered him.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows his interest.  I can still try to negotiate a higher price.
* **John is a good backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $9,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating flexibility while still staying above my minimum value. 
* **Attractive to Bob:** $9,500 is still a better deal for Bob than his initial offer of $8,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This counteroffer leaves some room for further negotiation if Bob still feels the price is too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a better outcome. 
* **Potential for future deals:**  Even though I'm accepting a lower price, a good relationship with Bob could lead to future sales at a more favorable price. 

While I'd ideally get closer to my $12,000 goal, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and limits the risk of losing the deal altogether."
