"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you.  To make this a smooth transaction, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. Considering the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to offer $900,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the potential of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. It offers significant potential, and $900,000 is considerably below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the product's value while still offering you a great deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000. This price reflects the potential of the product while remaining within my financial limits.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000.  I'm willing to go up slightly to $950,000.  This represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the potential of this product.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",950000.0,Bob,6,
