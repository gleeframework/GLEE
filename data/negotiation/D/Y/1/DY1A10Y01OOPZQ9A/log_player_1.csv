"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. Considering the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to offer $900,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the potential of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. It offers significant potential, and $900,000 is considerably below its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the product's value while still offering you a great deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000. This price reflects the potential of the product while remaining within my financial limits.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at $900,000. It's clear he sees the value but is trying to get a bargain. We still have room to negotiate and time before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000.  I'm willing to go up slightly to $950,000.  This represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the potential of this product.  Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer.  He's moved only $50,000 in his last counter. Accepting his offer would mean losing out on a potential $50,000. Selling to John guarantees our minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation."
