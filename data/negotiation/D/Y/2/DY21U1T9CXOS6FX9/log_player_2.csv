**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than what he could get from John, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within his budget and saves him $250,000."
