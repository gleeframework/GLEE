"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your initial offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
