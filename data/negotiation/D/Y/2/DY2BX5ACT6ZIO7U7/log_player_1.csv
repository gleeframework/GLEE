Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects a fair price for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, but still ensures a great profit for you.
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:**  Offering a price too close to your minimum ($10,000) could make Bob suspicious of the product's value or lead to unnecessary haggling.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale and avoiding the need to sell to John at your minimum price."
