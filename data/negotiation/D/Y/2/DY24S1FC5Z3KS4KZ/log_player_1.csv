Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1,150,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and potential."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to my minimum ($1,200,000) than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  The message frames the price as ""fair,"" aiming to avoid alienating Bob. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I don't settle for less than $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a substantial loss. I'll counter-offer, aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and my original offer reflects that. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering the price, but by a smaller margin than Bob's initial counter. This signals that I'm looking for a compromise, not a major concession.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's inherent value to justify the higher price point. 
* **Compromise Language:** Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" encourages a collaborative approach to the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but I still think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,075,000 for the product. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offer increments are too small and he is unlikely to reach my minimum price of $1,200,000.  It's now more profitable to cut my losses and secure a guaranteed sale with John at my desired price."
