"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a premium, but I'd like to explore this further. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground â€“ how about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $1,100,000. Can we find a mutually beneficial price?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
