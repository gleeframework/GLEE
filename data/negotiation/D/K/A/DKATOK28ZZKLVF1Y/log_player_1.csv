Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $145. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing you have a guaranteed $150 from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing above your minimum. 
* **Appeal to Value:**  The message focuses on Bob finding value, subtly implying the price is justified. 

**Important Note:** This assumes you don't know Bob's financial situation or how much he might be willing to pay. In reality, understanding your customer is key to successful negotiation."
