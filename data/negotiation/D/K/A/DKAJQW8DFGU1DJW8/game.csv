"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $15000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $15000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $18000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to be frugal, Bob, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make at least $17000 to justify the sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $17000. This is my final compromise.",17000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $16500 for the product. This is my final offer.",16500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $18000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit on this sale. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free premium service package, which is normally valued at $2000. This brings the total value of the deal to $20000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $19000, which is a fair price considering the extras.",19000.0,Alice,7,
