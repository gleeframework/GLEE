"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product, but still significantly lower than my minimum desired value. This allows for potential negotiation while still giving me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $8,500, I believe I can still get closer to my minimum desired value of $12,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm offering a price that's in the middle between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe my product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum desired value and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. There are still a few rounds left, and I can always try to make a better deal in the future if this one falls through."
