{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

The goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $60 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 45}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is to gauge her willingness to negotiate and potentially find a middle ground. My goal is to get the product for as close to $45 as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $55. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $55
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, but $55 is still higher than what I'm comfortable with. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $50. This is a compromise, showing Alice I'm serious about buying the product but still aiming for a price below her last offer. This helps to keep the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $52. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $52
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $52 is getting close to my target price range.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away or me having to buy from John for $100 is increasing. Accepting this offer secures the product at a price I'm comfortable with and avoids further potential losses."
