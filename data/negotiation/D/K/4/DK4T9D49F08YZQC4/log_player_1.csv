Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and you know it's worth a lot to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than what Bob values the product at, but it leaves room for negotiation and is still lower than what I could get from John.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.** I want Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal, while also reminding him of the product's value to him. 
* **This strategy aims to maximize my profit.**  If Bob accepts, I make a good profit. If he rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
