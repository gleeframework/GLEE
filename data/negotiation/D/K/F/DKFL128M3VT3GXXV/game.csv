"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,900,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I understand your budget, but  $1,900,000 is significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of this product and its potential for you. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  $1,700,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit over budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This represents a significant compromise for me, and I hope you'll consider it.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
