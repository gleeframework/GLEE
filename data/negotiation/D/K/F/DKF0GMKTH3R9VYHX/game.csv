"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10000.0,Alice,3,
