Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $12,000 from John, and Alice's offer is higher than his maximum budget. It's worth seeing if Alice will lower her price to a level that works for Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $14,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product, which is still a fair price considering the value it provides to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
