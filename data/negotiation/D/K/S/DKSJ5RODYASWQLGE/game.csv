"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and still provides you with a substantial profit. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $850,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. ",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $825,000.  I'm willing to come down a little further, to $835,000. This would allow me to accept the offer while still making a reasonable profit. What do you think?",835000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $835,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $820,000, which is the absolute maximum I can go. Can you consider this offer?",820000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go lower than $825,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",825000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're trying to make a reasonable profit, but I'm really struggling to go above $810,000. Can you meet me at this price?",810000.0,Bob,8,
