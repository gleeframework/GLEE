""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value is significant, and I believe it can generate substantial returns for you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. This is a rare opportunity, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the exclusivity of the product, but I'm not willing to pay $1,800,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is a good profit, I believe I can negotiate a better deal with Bob.  I'm not willing to settle for less than a significant profit margin at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth and the value it can bring you.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle.  How about $1,600,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value and potential of this product."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is clearly interested and engaging in the negotiation. While $1,300,000 is a good offer, I'm aiming for a higher profit margin. I'll continue to negotiate strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. How about we settle on $1,450,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a considerable return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,350,000, but I need to be comfortable with the price. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is clearly anchored around the $1.3 million mark and we're getting into the later rounds.  Accepting $1,350,000 secures a strong profit, and minimizes the risk of him walking away or further low-balling the offer."
