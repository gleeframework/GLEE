"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we compromise at $11000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about getting this product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $11500?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $11000? I'm willing to make a final offer, and if you're willing to accept it, I'll buy the product from you.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. I can meet you at $11250, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer.",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11250 and my previous offer of $11000. How about we meet at $11125?",11125.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already told you that $11250 is my final offer, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm starting to think that maybe we're not a good fit for this deal. I'd like to propose a new option: I'll sell the product to you for $11250, but I need a commitment from you today. If you're not ready to make a decision, I'll have to consider other options. What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,9,

"I understand that you're not willing to go any lower, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've decided to take your offer to buy the product from John for $12000. I appreciate the opportunity to negotiate with you, but I think I've found a better deal elsewhere.",0.0,Bob,10,
