Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,050,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you want to meet in the middle, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I also need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer, and we have time to negotiate. Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, but we can push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this simple - $1,000,000 and we have a deal.  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're drawing a line in the sand at our absolute minimum. This gives Bob a chance to take a 'win' while ensuring we don't go below our fallback option with John. By stating it's our final offer, we increase the pressure for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm not willing to go all the way to $1,000,000. I think we're getting close, but I can only afford $975,000. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is anchoring firmly below our minimum acceptable price, and has even declared his latest offer as final. It's unlikely he'll significantly budge from this point.  We've secured our backup offer with John, which guarantees us our minimum acceptable price. There's little point in continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking losing the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
