"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you want to meet in the middle, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I also need to make sure it fits within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this simple - $1,000,000 and we have a deal.  This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm not willing to go all the way to $1,000,000. I think we're getting close, but I can only afford $975,000. That's my final offer.",975000.0,Bob,6,
