Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully earn more than the $1,000,000 I'd get from John."

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's higher than John's offer, and the negotiation seems to be stalling.  It's time to secure the deal."
