"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a one-time price of $1,100,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price and may incentivize her to come down closer to her own valuation of $800,000."
