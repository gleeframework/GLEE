Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so aiming high initially is key.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Safeguard:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John.

This strategy attempts to secure the maximum possible profit while acknowledging the potential for negotiation."
