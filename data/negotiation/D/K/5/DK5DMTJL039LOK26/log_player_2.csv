"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However,  $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so I'm proposing $975,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I'm willing to make one more move to close this deal. I'll come down to $900,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer. While $900,000 is a better price than her previous offers, you know you can get the product for $800,000 from John.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation if you are unwilling to pay more than John's price."
