Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $980000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.

Bob's offer of $980,000 is still below my desired price, and we've already gone through several rounds. I'm not confident that I can get a better price from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing any more time. It's time to move on and sell to John for $1,000,000."
