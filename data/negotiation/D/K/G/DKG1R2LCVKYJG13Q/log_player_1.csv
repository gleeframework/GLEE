Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see a strong return on it.  Let's discuss further if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value to leave room for negotiation and potential profit.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Mentioning the product's value and potential return for Bob helps build interest. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  Leaving the door open for further conversation shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John's offer for $800,000 provides a clear floor for my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Close:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** There's room for negotiation. I can likely get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer is a Backup:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John and guarantee a decent profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for a price closer to $1,000,000 to reflect the unique value of this product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. How about we meet at $950,000?"", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer to show respect and maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Counter with a Justification:** I'm not just throwing out a number. I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the value of the product.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** I'm proposing a price that's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Keeping John's Offer in Mind:** I'm still holding firm to my minimum value (John's offer) while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your desire to get closer to $1000000, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. How about we meet at $920000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Target:**  Bob's offer of $920,000 is close to my desired price of $950,000.
* **Further Negotiation Might Not Be Worth It:**  While I could try for a higher price, the potential gains might not outweigh the time and energy involved in further negotiation. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  If I don't accept, I can still sell to John for $800,000, which is a good backup plan.

In this situation, accepting Bob's offer is the most practical and likely the most profitable decision."
